Review,Rating
"The intrigue of Bridgerton comes from its tangled ecosystem of friends, frenemies, suitors, and voyeurs. The most exciting moments often come not from scenes of bombast but in the whispers that shape the season. There are men in this story, all of whom are interesting and often deeply alluring, but this is a show most concerned with the plight and passions of women. It does not feel the need to force high-concept drama or unnecessarily soapy details into their lives to make them interesting. There are romps in the meadows, kisses in the rain, and meddling mothers at tea-time, and it is all executed with such delicate flair that Bridgerton makes the usual fresh again. This is not just a show that takes its own concept seriously: It's one that respects the romance genre as a whole, and I cannot tell you how much of a relief it is to see that, especially given how widely ignored or derided romance novels are by the cultural mainstream. Van Dusen has enough trust in both his source material and the very concept of a Regency romance saga. The show gives every character in this vast ensemble room to breathe and the attention their unique plights deserve.
Creator Van Dusen makes Bridgerton's many twists and turns satisfying to the end, even when they're predictable, and the young cast of mostly unknowns brings zip and depth of feeling to material that could otherwise feel slight. There's a charming wink to it all - this is a show that knows exactly what it is, and wears its corset proudly.",7
"Here are my thoughts#1. I have to note that I had reservations about this when I first saw the casting of Simon and other POC actors. As a black women I didn't know if it was pandering to my ethnic group or if it was for genuine inclusivity. And after seeing Simon on screen I must say that he is PERFECT!! I literally can't picture him otherwise (and I've been picturing him for over a decade. (I also have to say the same for lady D))#2. I was surprisingly pleased with the Marina character (btw she's not new to the series. Just early). She will fit in like a puzzle.#3. I'm enjoying how flushed out Anthony is. I admit he was a little 1D for the first book since he wasn't a main character so I appreciate that tv allows him more dimension and build up.#4. The rest of the siblings are excellent too. The seeds of their characters are coming through.5. The visuals, directing, and music reminds me of a TRUE historical romance book. This doesn't feel like a made for tv show. I love how they managed to make the colors so beautiful and vibrant unlike other historical romance movies/shows that have everything ""accurately"" bleak.This series was my very first introduction to the romance genre of books when I was a little girl and I could not have asked for a better pilot episode. The characters, the chemistry, the intrigue, the intensity (this list goes on and on) is exactly how I pictured it and how I felt when I first read this series years ago.To all those that worked on this series , everyone from the actors to the crew, your artistic talent has not just made beautiful period piece show. No, your artistic talent has magically translated all the beautiful things I love about historical romance books and the writing of arguably the most famous HR author of modern times perfectly to the screen and to that I thank you from the bottom of my heart.",10
"This is such a good!!!!, The soundtrack and the story is amazing!",10
"That Regency London was so ethnically diverse? Apart from that (which was laughable), it was an entertaining way to spend Christmas Day afternoon after a hectic lead up to the day and a tummy full of food. I've certainly watched far worse and frequently, sadly.",5
"I first read the books years ago and this adaption has done it justice. Perfectly cast. The people obsessed with the ""diversity"" should know that this isn't a factual historical show, but a version of Georgian history that lives in the minds of all of us who love this type of thing and really need to get over it. They also didnt play string quartet versions of ""bad guys"" or ""thank u next"" back in the early 1800s. Basically, it's what I've dreamed of and waited for!Adore that they've kept the main storylines but complement them with lines that add, rather than subtract to the main line.Thank you Shondaland!",10
"Let me just start that I am a fan of the books so I am watching this as I did when I watched all the live actions of Pride and Prejudice, with eyes finally getting my wish of seeing my fave books come to life, and I was not disappointed. Is it a masterpiece? NOT AT ALL. Is it accurate to the books? Not so much but they did get the heart of it. There's a lot of issue I find with it but somehow I still find myself watching it because I love the genre.To note: If you are into the ACCURATE retelling of history then I'm telling you right now SKIP THIS. This isn't about the accurate retelling of history. So if the ""diversity"" and ""wokeness"", the designs of their costumes, the way they acted takes you away from the story because of inaccuracy then you will have a bad time. This isn't a documentary. This isn't a biography. This isn't a true story.Now first of, the books star different siblings so each season will focus on different Bridgerton with splice inserts of side stories. S1 is more steamy and shoves a more lustful play on their romance it's a fake love turned real love trope. S2 is a slow burn and might be boring for some as it is less steamy, it's an enemies to lovers trope.Now. If you're into the book series do give this a try! Of course it wouldn't be 100% accurate but I did feel that it was very true in how romance book genre goes. It's like a whimsical romance. Glazed over. Or whatever term. Something like those Hallmark Christmas romance movies but with more mature scenes. Modern music made classical. They really brought to life the family dynamic of the Bridgertons. I love how they interact with one another as a family.Finally. If you're just looking for a Pride and Prejudice or historical setting romance show then do give this a try! You might just like it.",8
"Another Shonda Rhimes hit! Loved it!For those low ratings, don't listen. If you read the comments, they all have the same theme, ""divers."" Not sure what divers have to do with the show but...oh well!I enjoyed the diverse cast :)",10
"Yes embarrassing what a way to ruin a book, ruin history. It upsets to think that Julia Quinn who wrote the source material that was so well researched in all areas sold her rights to made into this drivel. I hate to say Julia Quinn. Who was my go to re-read will never be re-read again. I am so sad the someone should sell her vision to be made into this embarrassing Tosh. I admired writers who hold on to their dreams, Rowling, Meyer and even EL James.
Just so so embarrassing!!!!!!!!",1
"I wish people would look beyond colour. It's a factious period drama. So what if black people are Dukes, ladies etc.",10
At least we would have gotten more of the actual story as written. I can't believe Julia Quinn agreed to this unrecognizable adaptation to a truly enjoyable story. This trashy novella was not worth putting on film.,1
"According to most, current and pressing issue with this show is diversity however the true fault in this show is it's acting and plot - the fundamentals of creating a good show. The plot is, to put it simply, incoherent and ridiculously produced. I could not work out whether or not the show was a parody! In addition, the acting is shocking and a true insult to modern theatre. I was terribly disappointed. Usually I like to be introduced to new actors and shows, but this offensive portrayal of aristocrats and the below-average representation of film actors left me with nothing but second-hand embarrassment and disgust.",1
"It's a one time watch. Acting is decent.
The Narrator sounds like Gossip Girl.",7
"I binged the entire season right after it dropped! Like JQ's well-written books, I couldn't put it down!!",10
"I absolutely loved it..
it's classic and romantic and enchanting.. love the cast.
it's perfect for everyone who loves the old classics.",7
"Facing a Christmas Day at home alone this splendid release was perfection.
I'm halfway through and I'm in love with Simon the very handsome darcyesque Duke, and the lovely Daphne and the Jo March frustrated Eloise. It is gorgeous to look at. It is witty and warm and faithful to the romantic ( or even erotic ) literature it is based on. The hand touch between Simon and Daphne is far more sensual than anything written or portrayed in Fifty Shades. Just luscious !",8
"The sets, the costumes, and the cast make this regency romance sparkle.",9
"There are a lot of aspects of this period drama to be criticized but i'm here to make a shallow comment on the lead actress. I've loved much worse quality period dramas if actors brought the emotions to me. But this Daphne girl...she's like a formless white piece of canvas , she looks like twelve and it's so awkward to watch her live an ""adult"" life.",6
"This show is so far the best adaptation from this gender, I can see how some people is going to be unhappy over all the changes but In my point of view all changes came from help it!
I love how they gave us something we was asking but also some details we did not know we wanted, as any adaptation.
I'm also deeply happy that they kept all the important moments but changed the lines.
Regé is PERFECT for Simon role, Phobe was able to make Daph even better then the original character.
Even this small detail about Anthony falling in love and having a broken heart over his affair with Siena, which we do not see in the books at all, was a good thing from the place I stand.
It's a DRAMA show and that's precisely what Shondaland gave us. I can't wait for more.",9
The charm of Julia Quinn's Bridgerton novels is in the truly likeable and engaging characters. The tv shows has made them bland and obnoxious. Unlike some reviewers the diverse casting doesn't bother me. The terrible adaptation of some of my favourite novels does. God awful. I can't get past the first episode it's just a travesty.,1
"Such a fun and joyful experience to watch. Love the casting, truly some of the dreamiest actors around!",10
"Halfway through I already fell in love with this show. The characters are beautifully chosen and I like their acting. The story is light but yet entertaining.I haven't read the books so can't say anything about accuracy, but most of this downrating reviews can't barely hide their racism.In this show I feel that it doesn't matter which colour we are and it's a nice thought, that history had gone the way it's told here.Well done Shonda! And haters gonna hate ...",10
"We have all seen movies or tv shows that are based on our favorite books/series. Some have been horrible: Flowers in the Attic, Montana Sky or any other of the Nora Roberts books, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, The Hunger Games. I could go on but you get my point. As I watch Bridgerton, I am enjoying the similarities and differences from the book series. I think the diverse cast makes the show all the more interesting. The actors and actresses do a great job of telling the story, Daphne and Simon have great chemistry. The whole cast is wonderful. True fans of Julia Quinn and Shondaland will appreciate the great performances. Looking forward to additional seasons.",10
"Ever since hearing this was going to be made into a series I have been anxiously awaiting it. This series has gone beyond my expectations. I love the costumes, the pageantry, and above all the cast. Each character is very well represented by the actor/actress portraying them. I love the addition of a diverse cast. It in no way detracts from the story and makes it a beautiful representation of today's society.
I was nervous at first that the move to the big screen would not carry over the beauty of the story but I am happy to say that I am in no way disappointed. This is a great series and I highly recommend it to everyone loved the books or just loved a great romance.",10
"Eloise and Lady Danbury are by far my favorites but I liked it all overall, quite different than the book but keeping essential plots and the essence.
I do love the diverse casting.",10
"For me it wasn't about skin, but about beloved heroines from the book. I was expecting some familiar vibes, but no. We have foolish Anthony, Simon and od course Daphne. We have younger but plain mrs. Danbury. And oh, no, mean, stupid Penelope, my favorites.",1
"I see people crying here that 18th century London was as white as white could be and they have given rating 1 without watching more than one episode (written clearly in their review, thus actually they are unfit to review this ) but as racism is filled in their mind they are saying let the history be accurate when the story is BASED ON NOVEL NOT HISTORY!!!!!!!!I liked the story and beautiful cast and by the way I have seen half the season",8
"I have read all the books and I enjoyed it. I was very excited about this tv show. When I saw the trailers I was a little bit disappointed because the actors where not like I imagined them in book. But after I started watching I really enjoyed it. Yes, there are some differences in plot, new faces like Ms Thompson, but its cool. I would say that maybe has more vivid plot that book itself. Yes, ofc it would be nice to follow the basic plot, but its just fine for me. Diversity is fine too. It's all part of our creativity and imagination.",8
"This is ridiculous! The acting is barely okay, it's superficial, the mix of ages doesn't work for me! Maroon 5 or Billie Ellish have nothing to do in a ballroom in the 17th century. Some rules have to be respected to be true to period dramas. I had great expectations but....",1
Disney and merchant/ivory have had a love child. Guaranteed to fill you with self loathing as you binge it to the end.,4
"I am well aware of Quinn's Bridgerton series, but people are not focusing enough on things such as directing, plot, acting, etc. Who cares if there weren't black aristocrats? This point keeps dragging and it's honestly quite pointless. Quinn herself expected a very inclusive cast and a re-interpretation of the series. Stop wasting your energy in worrying about ""pc culture."" Have some imagination.Now, the plot is predictable for a novel series like this. I chose to watch it with my mother and it was enjoyable like an afternoon conversation with friends. Nothing deep really, lack of subtlety. But that doesn't have to be a bad thing. People often forget who are watching series and films, forgetting that some may not understand the undertones of a message. Bridgerton's lack of subtlety is beneficial for them, for my mother who doesn't understand English aristocracy because of our background. She loved the series.It is a VERY colorful setting. Wonderful clothes and scenery. There is a lot of individuality represented through that. Some characters certainly felt re-interpreted from the original material. For example, I hadn't imagined anyone with particularly loud personalities, mainly in presentation. The series provides this. Admittedly, Daphne was an absolute bore many times. I was not passionate about Thompson. So basically, some characters were louder, some were more tame when compared to the original. At times I welcomed the change, but not every time.Anyway, I look forward to the progress of this series. I also look forward to people relaxing a bit and trying to understand that media enjoyment is different for others. Literature majors may scurry away from the predictable and superficial, but (for example) someone whose main language isn't English and has always lived in a low-middle class neighborhood may feel welcomed into a different culture and may start a learning opportunity. It's not about absolute accuracy, it's about captivating our attention at first sometimes.Oh and also, I don't think the subtitles in Spanish are the best. There are words that change tone when translated. I listened as I read the subtitles. I had to re-translate a few times so my mother.",7
If you enjoyed historical romance with a bit of scandal and swoons thrown in then this series is for you. The historical accuracy is nearly zero but the series was well told as it almost retold the novel. It was as captivating as the book and an easy watch,8
"Full marks to the cast and crew to bring our beloved characters to life from the page! Though there are some major diversions from the books, the stories of all main characters remain essentially the same. It does give us readers something different to look forward to, some surprises!Absolutely loved the cast. They are inch perfect. Acting is stellar and I had no trouble imagining them to be exactly who they portray! Thanks for bringing the Bridgertons to life, all of you. Looking forward to season 2 already!",10
So refreshing to see the heart of a story embraced!,10
"Overall I really enjoyed the series, the characters were interesting and all the scenes with the siblings were funny and realistic. Episode 6 was very problematic, and I wish they didn't include it. Also, the lgbt rep was pretty lousy, laughable even.",8
"A gorgeous-looking drama based on Julia Quinn's bestselling romance novels. This adaptation is fresh, exciting and a whole lot of fun. Think Austen and Gossip Girl, mixed with Downton, The Crown and perhaps a dash of Outlander. A splendid regency romp with a spectacular cast that are perfect as their characters. Sit back, relax and enjoy some good fun. Absolutely cannot wait for season 2.",10
"Its a great series. Not supposed to be the books, but a different version inspired by them. I like the diverse cast and the amazing costumes. I've been a Julia Quinn fan since she started writing and I think this series does the Bridgerton books proud.",10
"Absolutely fantastic show, for lovers of the books and the new finders through the Netflix series. Julia Quinn's fantastic and well loved Bridgerton series was wonderfully turned to film by the people at Shondaland and gave it a new light. The brothers and sisters of the Bridgerton family tell their stories in a steamy way, and you get to see them in a new light. Best thing that's come out this year!",10
Awesome series. Can't wait for more! The costume and cast were great! Loved how the book was brought to life.,10
This is the best!!!! You must watch it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,10
"The series is fast-paced, witty, fun, sexy, and everything from the actors to the production are extremely pleasing. Episodes that have no boring parts that you just want to skip over like other series. A modern touch on Regency romance that viewers around the world can enjoy.",10
"I started watching this series and I must say that I really enjoyed it! This series is fun to watch, especially if you like Gossip Girl. The costumes are well chosen and the characters are fun to watch as well. It is not an accurate representation of the 18th century.
However, it is a series, which is why it does not have to be. Diversity in a series is good! In my opinion, netflix did a very good job with the cast and the entire series.",9
"Thank you Shonda Rhimes for your exquisite talents! The writing, the wit, and casting was well done! You gave a modern take on the period drama. Mere morals are not worthy.",10
Should have made it more realistic for the place and time period. But once again Hollywood has to impose their social justice narrative! I started to watch it and quickly realized how unrealistic it was and what Netflix was once again doing with their racial obsession. How about we remake Roots and Porgy snd Bess with all white actors!,5
"Only two episodes in, but highly recommend for its almost perfect blend of genres with a delicate touch of mystery, comedy, lust and scandal. Once I lowered my expectation of a deeply moving drama and relaxed into Shondaland's virtuoso ability to entertain, Bridgetown becomes most entertaining. Nowhere near a Marie Antionette, but could classify with Downton Abbey.",7
I loved it! I watched and finished Netflix in 2020 but this today on xmas day was such a delight. I need season 2,10
"I had to stop watching after just a few episodes. I personally see nothing wrong with the diversity of the cast, accept the fact that the acting is just a no. The accents and voices seem so unnatural that when the writers try to capture over hearts it honestly made me cringe. The leading actress has vertically no personality and might as well be a plank of wood (I haven't gotten too far but still), and because of this I was more interested in the supporting couples. The set and wardrobe are really quite beautiful tho so I guess that counts for something (the only reason for the 3 stars).
I just hope that for the sake of my mother, who has decided to continue, the series get better!!",3
"For the first few minutes, I was wondering if it were a SPOOF but I found I was wrong .",4
I am thoroughly entertained and thrilled by this show's revolutionary vision!,10
"I would probably give this series a higher rating if I had not read the book. Daphne and family bears little resemblance to the characters that Quinn created and that I fell in love with.Daphne is not a ""diamond of the first water"" in fact she is quite on the shelf. Her brother while being defined as a rake has always put his family first. Violet Bridgerton would have never allowed her son to speak to her as Anthony did in the first episode. The only characters that roughly resemble the book are Eloise and Simon.I have no issue with color of any of the actors; however it does seem a bit forced. That said the only reason why I gave this 4 stars is because of Page's performance.I waited so long for this and feel like the wonderful Bridgertown family and the differences between them and the normal 1800s British families have been so violated.",4
"Beautiful story, cinematography, and cast. Definitely recommend.",10
"That's it. Just perfect. Watch it. I've seen it all at once on Netflix. The books are quite good too, but you don't have to read it to watch the show.",10
"It is as good as I expected from the trailer. I have waited for a few months and I didn't regret it at all. One thing that I don't like is just it is come to an end-I demand for the second season to come next year!! I have finished it in one sitting because the very first episode has captured me perfectly! Oh, and also, Rage-Jèan is my new obsession for the whole month!!!",8
"I do not have a problem with diversity or that this series does not align perfectly with history... but my problem is that it is a period piece. And while they did not hold to truth on the race of aristocrats - you should expect this when it is a Shondaland production, think Hamilton - the issue is they held true on the language used and the seriously deep misogyny. It is almost every line and well, the very theme of the series of events that take place to show the eligible women off to marry a wealthy man.I cannot watch much more of this... so far I'm at 18.5 minutes... and I'm very disappointed.Rule of thumb for me, with all that is out there to watch or even re-watch and might I add READ as well... there is no shortage of entertainment. At 18 minutes my attention should have been grabbed. Rather I picked up my iPad to bang out a note of warning over my complete disappointment with this series.Unless you are a HUGE fan of period pieces, flat acting, misogynistic themes (a woman better get married or suffer the life of a spinster; ""after she went and ruined herself"" UGH!) and as I've seen from the other reviews if you are able to overcome the racial diversity that was not even remotely true (again think Hamilton) - then be my guest.But for me, there is enough oppression out there for women without having to slog through eight 50-minute episodes reminding us how poorly women were and are still treated.For me this is a solid PASS!",1
"This show is well made, nice costumes, good actors. It deserves at least 7 stars or more. Love the soundtrack as well. Some people are just haters for no reason.",9
"Like Gossip Girl meets Downton Abbey. Is that a good thing? Maybe for a few escapist trashy hours, but like gossip girl, the fun probably wears thin and it becomes a boring rehashed soapy plot that no sets and costumes can save after three or four episodes.",3
"Costumes are great. The sets are perfectly lush but I really don't care for the writing, the acting or the pacing. People screaming for historical accuracy need to get over themselves.",3
"The reviews for every film are usually justified, except for this one. All the bad reviews are because of diversity. However, let me remind you that it was never meant to be historically accurate.
It is a great quality tv show where black people are equal to white and not portrayed as servants only. Finally, children will be able to sympathize with the main hero instead of asking their parents why are we portrayed as slaves in nearly all movies. The main message here is to imagine new dawn for humanity, which some time ago were two separate societies divided by color until a king fell in love with a queen. Love conquers all and can change everything. Be kinder.For anybody who wants to watch a visually stunning tv series, with great actors, and a captivating story - give it a try.",10
"I read this book many years ago and can see why Julia Quinn's series would be made into a TV series. I am glad it has been developed a bit more as times have changed and character backstories have more depth. It's like the easy beach reads have had a 'Chilling Adventures of Sabrina' glow up. I have no issue with the diverse actors used, as they all act well, and the female characters while understanding their role in life (making good marriage connections and producing heirs), they mostly understand and strive for more. I like the use of modern music, dances and costuming, which together make the series feel modern. The broody rake-ish type is a bit repetitive and yet we still love that (plus Regé-Jean Page gets topless). Stand outs are Adjoa Andoh (Lady Danbury),Nicola Coughlan (Penelope) and Claudia Jessie (Eloise) are brilliant too",8
"Look, if you want a costume romp and to forget the setting, this is your lot. Everything is so obviously an American writing on British historical society that the facts and manners are not so much ignored as put on a ship, sailed out of Portsmouth and roundly cannoned to the depths. All the British actors on set must have been falling about between takes with laughter at the whole shebang! Enjoy for the story. I'd say The Crown was more historical than this flight of fancy....",5
"Waiting all season to see Julie Andrews unmasked as the Lady Whistledown and then it's little Pen. I do love a ""wow, did not see that coming"" moment. All though hard to follow, it is not an easy watch. The cast each delivered good performance for the 1800's but stand out performances for me came from Elrose, Antony and Lady Delacorte. Nice touch with making modern music instrumental to suit the era. All in all not a show I will watch twice but I'm glad I did.",10
Loving it so far. Read all the books and this is such an enjoyable show.,10
"Beautiful settings and couture.
Nice story of daily worries of the so called upperclass",10
"I enjoyed it a lot. the acting and everything, good to find a good show during this year",9
"First off, the inaccuracy in this show doesn't come from black aristocrats as so many people have been complaining about. Clearly, these people are uneducated idiots with no comprehension of English History, particularly in the late 18th and early 19th century, who have also never watched the film 'Belle', based off the TRUE story of Dido Elizabeth Belle, a mixed-race British heiress, born into slavery, taken back to England by her father and raised by an Earl. So the idea of black aristocrats is not so ridiculous as these ignorant, foolish ""critics"" complain about it being. (Not all black people were slaves in England, maybe try looking at black communities that existed during Elizabeth I's reign who were ordinary people and not slaves to correct your clearly ill-informed assumptions - particularly the BBC's article entitled ""Britain's first black community in Elizabethan London"").
Now that that's cleared up, I will say that this is historical fiction/romance, and as always, allowances can be made for historical inaccuracy because the 'history' part is often less important in these sorts of stories than the romance, and I'm certainly not watching this for historical accuracy - if I wanted that, I'd watch something on the Smithsonian channel.
I don't normally go in for romance, but I have to say that even the rather outlandish plot, the hideous fashion that the Featheringtons favour, and the slightly over-dramatic nature of the entire thing hasn't put me off or dulled my enjoyment of this series. It is entertaining, and an escape from the dull, rather bleak reality we're all living through at the moment, and so in that way, it provides the perfect kind of escapism, something completely unlike real life, where true love wins, despite all of the troubles along the way, and the bad guys have their downfall (I'm thinking particularly of Daphne's first suitor/proposal. She throws a particularly good punch, so well done Daphne!). Gossip Girl set in a historical (though fairly inaccurate) setting, and thoroughly enjoyable",10
I really love most of the changes they did from the what was on the book. Love the cast they did wonderful! They truly played their characters well! I had fun watching this series and do recommend to watch it!,10
"Julia Quinn created a dream worthy, charming Duke in the book. The chemistry between Daphne and the Duke should be palpable! He is supposed to be dashing with blue eyes. I can't buy into this, there just isn't anything brooding about him. Zero chemistry, ZERO. Not off to a good start with this one...",7
"Is a great story, really well made and enjoyable to watch, I think the actors all did a great job and is really refreshing to see people of color in period stories.
And if you are mad about that last thing then stay mad and quiet thanks.",10
An enjoyable watch that I was unaware was based on a series of novels.,9
"Sorry but I could watch only for 10 min. The queen who behaves like a drank sailor in a pub. Where is the grace and benevolence? Really???
Editing my first review: after seeing a high score ratings, tried to whatch one more time, picked episode 3. No!! It is impossible. I have very sophisticated taste in movies and degree in art history.
This movie is nothing but a disappointment",1
Terrible casting and even worse acting. The whole thing does a fun book series a disservice. I am disappointed.,1
"I love the culture, costumes and cast!I enjoy the storyline and believe the show will continue to do great.Check your racism at the door! Stop trying to make everything black and white - judge the show on the acting and true storyline.",10
"First off, I couldn't care less about the diverse cast. The actors who played Simon and Lady Danbury were great. But the personalities for Anthony, Violet, and so many others were just...wrong. I wasn't a fan of the addition of Mr Featherington, or the boxing they included.
And why has no one mentioned the absurdity of the royalty plot?? Why was that needed? Ruined the whole thing for me.
The fleshing out of the other siblings was nice, but it also left a lot of blank spots in Daphne's development.",3
"As long as you realize that it's fine. I thought it would be more witty, more sparkling like the new Emma movie which was quite quirky. I kept expecting it to have more of a contemporary spin. But its predictable tosh! And heroine looks insipid, not sure why she called an incomparable when she is so timid!Nice sets, lovely dresses shame about the plot...",7
"Things I liked- costumes, sets, mama bridgerton, Eloise, the Duke is hot, Marina change up and seeing Sir Philip early, musicThings I didn't like- Papa Feathertons arc and the queens arc...both didn't add much to the story. And revealing the identity of Whistledown too early.....it should of been cut considering the series was renewed before it even premiered.Something interesting- you see the bee throughout the series but no mention of its significance...",9
Everything from the cast to the costumes to the plot was just wonderful! Things are always bound to change in adaptations and in this case for the better. Casting for Simon and Lady Danbury in particular were marvelous choices! I am so very glad this show has been created and look forward to seeing many more seasons to come that will depict all the other Bridgerton books!!,10
Wonderful and really keeps you on your toes. for real a very good watch to curl up on the couch.,9
"Fluffy, pretty, captivating! Well written and well acted! People who fuss about historical inaccuracies obviously either haven't read the books or haven't read history. Quinn takes as much liberty with history as Shonda takes with Quinn's source material. Both are fun and entertaining. If you want historical accuracy, read Hilary Mantel (also a great read/show, but much much more grim. As is history)",9
I'm okay with watching this film just for the fun but Jane Austen is an artist and her usage of words and ability illustrate people and their world they live in is comparable to a skilled painter and his brush strokes.,6
"Like a huge fan of the books I have to say that I'm delighted with the show. It's absolutely charming, modern, beautiful... So happy with the result, so happy about de whole crew, actors, actresses, directors and specially shondaland team! Thank you all for this show.",10
"Delightful n Delicious - binge watch if at all possible - plan to watch it again n again - should come with a warning label - the Duke is HOT, has a great behind, wonderful eyes n expressive face n body - yep, defgonna watch n rewatch - n probably a few scenes rewind n repeat. Great period details. Loved the blended cast. Great series that should have wonderful future seasons!",10
"I absolutely love this adaptation. I've read the books and Shonda has brought the characters to brilliant life. The music, costumes and sets are breathtaking. I can't stop watching. Can not wait for Season 2!",10
"I have read all of the books and the movie was beyond my wildest expectations! Loved the actors, costumes, storyline, etc... I can't wait for the next season!",10
"This show really captured the FUN of Julia Quinn's work. While I did find the diversity of the cast to be a bit blatant, the story moves right along as of their skin color didn't matter. I REALLY liked the portrayal of Simon once I knew the writers weren't adding in some background of African roots. Just the actor's skin color; no big deal.
Costuming and sets are gorgeous. It's a bit fantastical rather than perfectly historical, but it balances nicely between the two in a nearly believable, but still fun, way.",9
"A refreshing take on historical drama. The humour is inspired, the costumes are divine and the cast all played their parts perfectly. I was hooked from beginning to end. Definitely recommend.",10
Simply wonderful. Well acted and delightful in its visual design.,10
"This show is very wrong and i am not talkin about the diversity the show honestly that is the only part that is respectable!! i am talking about the language, the dresses( shape and colour). on top of that it has mediocare writing at best. this could have been done more gracefully ofcourse. the idea was fine while making it reality something went horribly wrong. And please do not just say a show is good because it is diverse it is very important being diverse yes try to look past the big corprations maniplations and see and hear everything not just like a show because it is a bit different when it is empty an 2 dimensional.",1
"I loved this show! People need to understand that it is not a history lesson, it's fun and romantic, as it should be. And I loved they took the opportunity to showcase amazing POC talent playing parts that had not been usually portrayed by them.
Shonda is a genius.",10
Loved the series! Better than the books! The characters are faithful to the spirit and I loved every moment.I hope Netflix does right by Shondaland and keeps this running for all the books!,10
"Better than my expectation, i have to admit. the story flow quite good enough whilst the casts are not the superior good looking but lovely & adoring. cant wait to watch the season 2",10
The acting style is painful to watch. Costume and set choices are tacky. I cringed through the first episode hoping it would get better. It didn't. If you are looking for an imaginative/funny period piece watch The Great instead.,1
I read all the series of The Bridgerton and it is icredible how i could see the characters in the actors. I really loved everything,10
"Nothing redeeming about this show, why even call it Bridgerton when it completely butchers the story beyond recognition",1
"Not 100 percent true to quinns novels but books to screen never are, something I prepared myself before watching.A wonderful series even if hadnt read the books before would have still enjoyed. Love the twist with morden music in classic form, the sets and costumes are exquisite.
The cast are amazing and well casted.As for those saying its not historically correct, its not meant to be, hate to tell you this but this isn't real!!! This isn't based on real life, it isn't a true story, and never once claimed to be.
Dont let your racism show and enjoy the show and the actors for their amazing work and not judge the colour of someones skin ( your only embarrassing yourself)Only Wish the characters especially the bridgerton family members were more like their orginal novel selves. There is a reason Quinn fans love the bridgerton family so much writers please don't change that.Can not wait for series 2!!!",10
"I must admit I don't catch everything because they talk so fast in their British accents but I'm enjoying it so far! The costumes are lovely and while some of the acting is a bit campy, I still enjoy it all. It's a spectacle to be hold for sure!",8
"First off, question for those complaining about historical accuracy over a purely fictional story: black aristocrats are an inaccuracy, but string quartet covers of Ariana Grande and Taylor are historically spot on? Give us a break from your racism and pettiness.As for the show, I find myself not liking Shonda's work more often than not, but I've managed to willingly sit through this one because it is a time period I'm most interested in (Pride & Prejudice is one of my all-time favorite movies). I appreciate the elements that give the show a slightly modern twist for a period that is usually portrayed as completely modest and proper. The setting is visually beautiful and it's refreshing to see a diverse and eclectic cast (reminds me of Brandy's Cinderella). The plot is standard yet I enjoy these little matchmaking/suitor storylines, and I'm interested in seeing more of the show.",7
"Even though I am an enormous Regency fan I had never heard of these books, let alone read them. I'll admit that the first episode was a bit disconcerting since I didn't know anything about the show before seeing a short trailer, but I soon realized the genius of the casting. The actors are well chosen and play their characters with believability - isn't that all we really need? I laughed, I cried, I fell in love with Daphne and Simon. And especially with Lady Danbury. I'm going to see if I can download the rest of the books and I'll probably be up late tonight, reading more about my new favorite people and seeing them all in my mind's eye. I cannot wait for season 2!",8
What happened to this series ?? Tell me Julia why did you sell your story? Why did you allow Shonda to change it that way? I am very disappointed !!!,1
Really enjoyed it watched the whole season in one setting Hope there's a season two??,10
"This wonderful and romantic book series has been beautifully brought to life in the Bridgerton series! As someone who has read the books over and over again, the introduction to the Bridgerton family was so cleverly done. They took the over lapping timelines from the various books into the series and set into motion each characters personalities and laid the groundwork for their eventual love story. Daphne and Simon were played so well, whether they were flirting, fighting or tearing each other's clothes off. I laughed, cried and swooned as I binged all 8 hours in a row. I can't wait to watch it again and this was such a wonderful Christmas present (and a 2020 highlight.)",10
"I can't wait for more I'm obsesses, i know it is probably not for all people who read the book just give it a try it won't hurt",10
"A lovely indulgence show. Enjoyed every moment. Every single one of the actors was so attractive, I literally could not tear my eyes away from the screen.",10
This show is amazing! If you've read the books then you understand the importance of this show. Absolutely wonderful!! I'm so thrilled with all the episodes.,10
"As many people have mentioned previously, this series is an adaption of Julia Quinn's steamy romance series. As a long time fan of her work, I was not amused by the direction this series went in. I have read the entire series multiple times. The books were lighthearted, funny, and rarely accurate to the historical time period themselves. As such, the historical inaccuracies in the Netflix show amused me rather than irritating me. The partially black cast may not have fit with the time period, but then again neither did Quinn's original characterizations, most of whom treated women with the respect they rarely had back then. This is a work of fiction, as reinforced by the random snippets of Taylor swift and Ariana grande. The thing that did irritate me was the direction they went with many of the characters I loved in the books. Everyone that provided comedic relief in the books suddenly became mean, awful, or unnecessarily dramatic. All of the comedy was replaced with drama. Simon and Daphne were the only characters in this season somewhat accurate to their characters in the books. Due to the changes, I'm not sure if season 2 will be able to redeem some of the characters enough for me to like them again.Summary: Do not watch expecting a historical accuracy or Quinn's or lighthearted comedy. STEAMY: Do not watch with anyone you wouldn't watch GOT with. Watch with the reminder that this is from the same person that gave us Grey's anatomy. Overall, decent way to kill time in 2020",7
"A sumptuous and romantic adaptation of the first book in one of the best regency romance series of all time. The cast are beautiful and engaging and the story top notch with a swoon worthy happily ever after for the ages! Can I get season two now, please?",10
Pure escapism. I've read the books so was looking forward to this. Virtually stunning.,9
"This show is the absolute definition of a perfect show in my opinion, it has everything you need and are looking for in a tv show, it has the drama, the romance, the tension, the anger, the humour, and much more, i believe as well that any person of any age would enjoy this show as much as i have.
Yours sincerely,
Lady whistledown.",10
"I hadn't heard of the books but added this to my list when I saw it was produced by Shonda. Julie Andrews as the narrator, beautiful sets, clothes and photography plus modern songs by string quartets. Why can't people take shows for what they are - absolutely exquisite escapism?! Loved every second of this!",9
"I've not read the books so don't know how faithful it is but this series was great fun. It was over the top and very dramatic but also very funny. Which is exactly what you want from a Regency era comic-drama.It's exactly the sort of thing to take your mind off real life drama. It is definitely a good idea to spend 8 hours watching people dancing in beautiful clothes atextravagant balls, and wondering if the pretty young woman will marry the handsome Duke. (Instead of worrying about a pandemic) I definitely recommend.But to those complaining about ""forced diversity"" and ""wokeness"" of the series: get a grip.If this were a biopic or a retelling of a real moment in history then I would be as picky as anyone else about historical accuracy (although I do think some real life figures whose skin colour is not particularly important to their story, so it doesn't always matter). But this is a fictional programme. I assume all the people complaining that there shouldn't be black people playing aristocrats are also annoyed at the use of modern pop songs and modern phrases? No? Right, well it's just racism then.Do not try to disguise your racism by pretending that you care about historical accuracy when really you just don't like that you're seeing black people on the telly.Well the cast are all excellent and are in those roles because they are brilliant. And they're not going anywhere. So get used to it.And just watch it because it's wonderful, good fun!",8
"This is a Pride and Prejudice style romp around regency London in the style of Gossip Girl or The OC, with a hint of Wes Anderson and a smattering of Baz Luhrman.Perfectly watchable and entertaining, fairly fast paced, colourful, and fun. It is not high art or history, but not is it meant to be. Things like the colour-blind casting, to me, added to the energy, and - hell - why not!If you want an accurate costume drama this is possibly not for you, but give it a whirl. If you want a bit of fancy-dress fun and intrigue, have a crack.",7
"The casting is the best thing I have seen in a while!!!
I absolutely LOVED the books and they smashed it!!!
As far as I'm concerned the best book adaptations I have ever seen!",10
"I adore this show so much! The casting is brilliant and although it is of course not exactly as the book, the stories they added work perfectly I think. Can't wait for the next season!",10
"An absolutely wonderful show. brilliant cast, gorgeous visuals, amazing soundtrack! very compelling",10
"If you like history with romance, action and great actors you are at the good place ! Loved the books love even more the série even though some things don't totally match but that's normal as it is an adaptation and a great one !
I watched all the episodes over a night ! So addictive and well played",9
"I have read all the bridgerton books and I must say I am happy with the results of the adaption. Some areas has been modified to reflect modern subjects which gives the series more point and at times relatable feeling. Janes Austin styles with a few more saucy moments, enjoyed it so much, watch it all in one day! Would recommend to anyone",9
"I don't care what color the actors are or even about the inclusion of modern music, but I do care how the characters are completely butchered compared to the books. I'm a huge Quinn fan and this series, although welcome in theory, fails to capture the subtleties of each character and the humor of the narration. I want more period pieces on Netflix, yes, but please don't call this one Bridgerton.
I wish I hadn't read the books, perhaps I'd have enjoyed it more.",4
"I love it!!, and how the roles of expectations in society are reversed. Very good and worth watching",10
"I feel like people giving this bad reviews are just sort of freaked out by the casting of black and brown actors as historically caucasian figures. I mean, it was strange at first for me, mainly because I don't expect non-white people to speak in that posh, upperclass way and behave so rigidly as they do in these period dramas. But about halfway through the second episode I found the ""alternative"" casting made the whole thing more interesting to me. The non-white characters just grabbed my attention whenever they were on screen, partially because they're excellent actors and fun to watch (and Regé-Jean Page as the Duke - lordy, MEOW) and I think I also felt the sort of run-of-the-mill plot was elevated somewhat with this added visual element.But to criticise the acting as some did here is ludicrous. The acting is superb, as are the characterisations. The whole thing is a bit unreal, the candy-bright costumes especially give it a sort of fantasy feel. The plot is a bit one-note and simplistic, and I admit I'm not super enthralled with a drama focusing on whether or not certain people will get married, but it was charming, mostly due to the wonderful cast and buoyant direction.As people of that time might say, it's a ""most pleasant diversion"".",8
"Beautiful actors, gorgeous imagery... and can we talk about the costumes? Such attention to detail was paid in all areas.
Truly enjoyable to watch--every second of it.",10
"Honestly,i don't know what i expected before actually seeing Bridgerton, but it exceeded my expectations on so many levels. I am a big fan of JQ's novels, and never have i ever before seen a world from a paper so beautifully transferred to screen. All the emotions, the casting choices, the chemistry, the humor, while keeping the soul the novel has, i am speechless and still recovering from everything i felt when watching it. This is honestly the first adaptation where i can't say i wish they'd done something differently.
If you are looking for a historically accurate story, then move along from this one. How one can pay attention to skin color next to every beautiful detail this story is interwoven with, is beside me.
Will definitely be watching many times again as i am not ready to leave this world quite yet(not sure I'll ever be).
Thank you Shonda Rhimes and Chris Van Dusen for this work of art.",10
The casting was perfect. Simon *wink* is dreamy... it is a must watch (and read),10
"Those complaining of woke historical ""inaccuracies"" should also point out that the characters should all have rotten teeth and small pox scars all over their faces- but that is ok for them???",8
"This is a great show - funny, silly, basically Gossip Girl in the 1800s! It's mainly based on the first book but dips in and out of the others and adds a few new characters.If anyone is complaining about the diversity of the cast and it being 'inconsistent' with the period, then their racism is fully showing. The show makes use of modern songs, amongst other things inconsistent with the time period, yet no one cares about that...I can only assume this is because they don't actually care about accuracy and just want an excuse to vent their racism. I suggest they take a long, hard look at themselves and why it bothers them so much.",8
"I binged it one sitting. I loved how the characters interacted with each other, I loved the costumes, and I thought Daphne and her Simon had a great on screen chemistry.",9
"Finally we have a historical romance series which doesn't shy away from showing steamy and passionate scenes. This adaptation of Julia Quinn's acclaimed Bridgerton books is so much more than I had hoped it would be. The colours, the costumes, the music, the set design is vibrant and fairy tale like. This has drama, romance, gossip and well written characters that a romance lover will surely enjoy. Can't wait for S2.",9
"(In short... Book lovers should go in with an open-mind and Jane Austen lovers go in not expecting an historically accurate regency romance, but a fun modern twist!)If you're expecting this show to be a BBC Pride and Prejudice or Emma series, you will be sorely disappointed.
Bridgerton mixes modern society with a Regency backdrop. With it's diverse cast and orchestra versions of modern music, it has a very fresh and modern feel while still having most of what you love about a good Regency romance.
Being an avid reader of Julia Quinn's novels, I tried to watch this with an open mind, knowing book-to-tv adaptations will not be 100% true to their original stories. Though I thought the narration and overly-posh character's of the first episode of Bridgerton to be a bit over-the-top, the show does settle into a nice rhythm come episode two and onward.
The showrunners and writers really do capture what was and is so special about the Bridgerton novels' stories and characters while bringing in bits of other Bridgerton books and new characters and side-stories to fill out the show.
I really enjoyed this series and seeing the characters and I know and love being brought to the small screen. Very entertaining, sexy and fast paced all with beautifully designed costumes and sets. I binged all 8 episodes on Christmas day and I am ready to watch it again! I for one can't wait until season 2!",9
"Pretty good representation of book series, so far. Dumb to cast a Gregory to be younger than Hyacinth! I hope there are more episodes soon. ??",9
"Thoroughly enjoyed this adaptation of the books. The sets, locations and costumes were visually stunning. The actors embodied the characters we have come to love, and I loved the diversity of the cast. It should be noted that there were many POC in the Regency period, and Queen Charlotte was actually a person of mixed ethnicity. There was also a black Duke who was a member of the European aristocracy. There were also many marriages of mixed ethnicity. It's a pity that history doesn't do more to highlight POC instead of surpressing these details, leading many uninformed of historical accuracy.",10
"Ok, I was shocked at the beginning, I must confess. It was like why, why? I love period dramas, and the inclusion of people of color in those roles was not realistic and made me think of a bad joke. But I decided to give it a go, nothing better to do today. And oh my god. Once you have watched 20 mins, you are just captivated by it. I bing watched it. And rewatched again cause it is a beautiful story, music is great, to die for outfits. And the acting cast just wonderful actors, also beautiful. What a great show. Vibrant, colorful, exceptional.",10
This program has so much cheese they should have called it Wisconsin.,1
"After accepting the black aristocracy and that show even doesn't try to reflect the reality of 19th century I think this series was really fun and entertaining, story flow was really good. Not to mention the beautiful set and a dressing. Eight episodes went through in a jiffy leaving you to want more. Yes, I will definitely wait for season 2 to come!",9
I'm too thrilled by the show to make criticisms. I loved the casting. Loved the sets and costumes. Loved that they kept to the essence and spirit of the books. Loved that each episode felt long enough. Loved Pen and Eloise. Love. Love. Love.The only thing I would have liked to see more was more LOL wit that Julia Quinn is so good at.I want more seasons. I want ALL the seasons.,10
"I LOVED THIS SERIES SO MUCH AND AS A READER OF THE BOOKS, I CAN SAY IT IS AMAZING. Of course, as an adaptation there were scenes that I would like to be in the series, however everything is perfect that I didn't care. I highly recommend this series to everyone, remembering that there are hot scenes there are scenes that make you cry. And despite being a period series, the modernity inserted in it, current songs played in a classical version, everything is perfect. I highly recommend the series to everyone, remembering that there are hot scenes, and there are also scenes that make you cry.",10
"Pure unadulterated enjoyment!! A wonderful, theatrical, dramatic, romantic Production. Wonderful costumes, delicious relationships and characters. I can't wait to watch more! Thank you to cast and crew for giving us this in 2020!",9
Didn't know this was based on a book but gosh I binged the show and I LOVE it so much!I don't know why people are bashing on the acting but it's top notch just like everything else about it,10
"I never read the books, but I am loving this series. The diversity is fantastic and refreshing.",10
"It's like a bad played parody, not enjoyed, not recommend.",3
"1800's Gossip Girl with infusions of modern day references. I'm enjoying this series very much! (On episode 4)Also, to the one reviewer that was upset that black men and women are in this show as dukes, queens, princes, etc. you are the prime example of subconscious racism. Very disappointing.",8
"The show slaps if you're looking for escapism (who isn't) and if you stick with it, by episode 3 you'll be invested. @ everyone who's mad about good diversity and representation can shut up and go watch game of thrones ????
Also the costuming and makeup isn't that bad historically speaking and I haven't seen brastraps once (for this I give it 5 more stars)",10
Loved every second of it. Stays surprisingly accurate to the books. I was at first wary of the acting choice for Simon but I have to say he was perfect! The show also did a good job of incorporating narratives from the other books to prepare for the next seasons.,8
"I usually dont like the adaptations of books, this one though is an exeption. I loved that the first season set up information for the other characters, evwn more that the first book did. Specially loved the George-Marina-Philip subplot.",10
"I've been a fan of JQ's earlier work and the first 4 books of the Bridgerton series. I can not remember how many times I've read this series and know their stories by heart. I admit that I was one of the fans who were skeptical with the cast not being faithful to the book when I first got wind of the casting choices. I mean, where's Simon's piercing blue eyes? Why are the Bridgerton men's heights wrong or Daphne's hair colour is different than the rest. But whilst I was watching this, I forgot all those and embraced the characters with arms wide open. This is a work of fiction and people can do well by treating it as such. It is lavish, it is fun. There's drama and intrigue. Yes, they have changed the story a bit to fit a TV series but I have learned long before that books and movies are going to be different. I am giving it a 9 just because I'm still undecided if I like how they depicted one of my favourite characters. I can't wait for Anthony and Kate's story as that is my favourite book in the series! Bee it is!",9
"I was going to give this a chance until a heard a string quartet version of Ariana Grande's ""Thank You, Next"" It was then that I realized this is just some silly, cheap series targeted to younger viewers. No thank you, next?",1
"A true fan of Julia Quinn and The Duke & I was my first book read in her Bridgeton series and thoroughly enjoyed seeing the story come to live before my very eyes in Shonda/Netflix's version of this beloved Romance story! Loved everything about Netflix The Duke & I as the struggles were real for the mothers of girls as we had seen in P&P w/ Mrs. Bennett and making advantageous matches for their securities in a ""Man's World"" - The Duke & I delivered a stunning performance by a stellar cast of professional actors ... Lady Danbury & Lady Whistledown are two forces to be reckoned with ... The Duke & I deliver on a story worthy of Julia Quinn's imagination with pure visual delights ... Exquisite Costumes, Stunning Cinematography, breathtaking Choreography, and a well written adaptation of JQs novel of the same name. Thank you, Shonda Rhimes & Netflix, for allowing me to glimpse what the world of Regency period may have looked like with all the delights and naughty bits - I loved seeing Simon's back story and watching him realize through the eyes of love from his wife (Daphne) that he was a man of true worth - Simon never stood a chance from the moment Daphne bumped into (literally) at a ball - looking forward to seeing more of Daphne & Simon and the Bridgerton's ""Pall Mall"" game!",10
This series is amazing!! My expectations were high but they surprised me even more!! The actors showed us in a perfect way how the characters felt and everything was similar to the books! Regé was the best Simon I could've imagine!! Simply perfect!,10
"Put me to sleep in first 15minsSeriously what where the thinking , the cast to writing to acting everythings seems misplaced",3
"I loved!
It's perfect. I love the book and LOVED this series.
I need a new season.",10
I loved how they managed to get the essence of the characters from the books to the screen. I loved the scenery and the clothes as well as all the excitement as everything is presented. I loved it so much and I'm looking forward to the 2nd season.,10
"I was so excited to the series and I really loved the outcome, I just can't be more happy, the actors was a perfect, I just can't describe in word my happiness",9
"Talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show-stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique.",10
"Of what being in royal company would be like this may be your cup of tea. The Brits are still a nation ruled by royals so don't let their stuck up insidious accents fool you, they are dumb as ever.",1
"If you read the books, and want everything the same, i'm sorry but even the best movies can be like the books of they are based for.
So, with that in mind you need to watch this series, really, it's a piece of an art from Shonda and Chris, it's complety difference of everything we saw until now about them. And they were so faithful with our fellings about the this incredible family and characters, since Simon is describe like a different man, so i think the actor was awesome, the actress who plays Daph is marvelous! Both are! All the crew are. And since i'm historian i can assure you guys, the black people was , and is of course, but at the time was a very important part of society, since Queen Charlotte is describe as an almost black woman! Then, i think that's not a problem, and the actors are amazing, the serie is amazing, is almost like as the book, but we can meet better the characters of the next books, witch is good for a show, let's be open mind guys! Let's enjoy this beautiful series! Let's support the show and everyone, Julia Quinn too, she is so happy, so i really believe they maked a incredible show, and i hope we have more seasons!",10
"O QUE FALAR DE BRIDGERTON...
FICOU PERFEITOOOO
AMEI TUDO DO INICIO AO FIM, CADA LAGRIMA DERREAMADA FOI A CERTEZA QUE BRIDGERTON VAI SEMPRE FICAR GUARDADO NO CORAÇÃO.
O REGÉ É A PHOEBE DERAM UM SHOW DE ATUAÇÃO ASSIM COMO O ELENCO INTEIRO. ???????????????????? ??????????????",10
"Bridgerton is full of surprises! with a lot of romance, comic relief, powerful speeches and striking scenes, we have a series with a plot and captivating actors! it certainly differs from books, but nothing that a good fan cannot love! it is incredible to be able to see the whole ""history"" of the most fertile family in society coming to life!",10
"The plot of the tv show is amazing, is a typical shondaland show!",10
Fiquei impressionada com a produção dessa série. Já era apaixonada pelos livros e a série superou todas as minhas expectativas!,10
"Not great, but very good. I binged all episodes on Xmas day. I will watch this series again. Please give me more adaptions of romance/romantic science fiction please. The well to choose from is very deep.",8
"I expected people to be very upset about the diverse casting, and so many reviews comment on that rather than the actual show. Full disclosure I would've given this 8 stars but added one to balance out the exaggerated one-star reviews.I'm a huge Downton fan so I leaped at the chance to check out this show. I also liked Sanditon which was lighter and more saccharine.I binged the entire season of Bridgerton in one night, and am totally not sorry. My standard is whether I enjoyed the show and felt it worthy of the time spent watching. Yes, and Yes!I love period pieces, but also know Shonda Rhimes takes no prisoners where drama is concerned. I was not disappointed!Of course some of the plot is thin and characters fun but predictable archetypes. But that's also every Jane Austen novel! There are few revelations that can't be predicted based on similar shows and tropes. The Featherton family = a twist on Cinderella with evil stepmother and ugly stepsisters. Daphne and Simon = Beauty and the Beast etcBut boy did I love watching every episode. Lot's of imho over-the-top ""love"" scenes meant to be salacious and graphic but sometimes made me giggle due to the exaggeration.I loved all the bright and often garish costuming which was as much a part the characters as anything else. Lots of candy colors, rich blues, purples and pops of red. It was a visual feast!I thoroughly enjoyed this very fun and escapist show, and found it refreshing to see black people in period garb just living like everyone else and NOT discussing race. I didn't know I needed this show, but turns out I need more like this!Get your girlfriends together and watch!",9
I love this!! A true romance novel come to life...it has EVERYTHING.,10
"My god...I adore everything about this...Literally everything. And I've only seen 2 episodes. But...I know, because it's Shonda...that this will not only, never disappoint, but I'll be desperate for more...",10
"I liked the cast, but the drama is hard to understand. Why the creators brought Queen Charlotte to the scene? Why Marina and all the fuss with the opera singer?
It was confusing, it made the plot slow and heavy.
Simon is so freaking HOT, but not even him could save this disaster.
Eloise was so annoying, and the costumes... This is a nonsense.
A terrible waste of time. I hope they do a better job for the second season. Julia Quinn and her characters deserve better.
And the music... horrible attempt.",1
"I loved it. I've read the whole series and i can understand why they made more plots: one book doesn't have material to 8 episodes.
And its ok!
I loved everything, the costumes, the music, the chemistry between the Duke and Daphne!
Loved the relationship between Eloise and Benedict (which was another surprise! Lovely actor!)
Loved the Featherington plot line, and the Marina thing, cause I didn't feel a attachment for her in the books, and now i can!
Love the Queen and Lady Danburry specially her been Simon's tutor.About Anthony... he is lost, and the whole Siena thing makes so much better for the start of the plot for the next season, and how he loving Kate will be unexpected!For me, it was perfect!",10
"I enjoyed every moment of this lovely series. It is pure escapism. It is beautifully casted, sexy and fun. I hope there will be more of it in the future. It is wonderful to see beautiful actors of color given the oppurtunity to show their stuff in a period piece like this. I loved it.",10
I'm giving this a higher rating than I should not because of the storylines (predictable) but because of the lead actor as Simon. I'm a 56 year old white woman and all I can say is yum-my!,8
"I do not know the books and came with expectations. I do love a good period piece, so seeing a diverse cast was odd to me at first. It did raise eyebrows for me. But then, from the get go, you clearly see that this isn't meant to be historical: contemporary twist on classical music, unrealistic plot etc... and surprisingly it worked for me! I got mesmerised by it and couldn't stop watching. The characters are charming: Simon's super hot, Daphne very cute, the Queen! Hell that really spelt it: hey! This is fantasy and meant to be fun. It's really really worked for me. It's colourful and wonderful. For once actors of colour are not confined to playing servants and it's a good change. It's fun, it's positive, it's well played, it's imaginative, just give it a go.",10
"I love the series. Is it an exact retelling of the books, of course not. Books are never translated perfectly to screen, but this takes a beloved series and gives it enough of a twist to watch it as an entirely new product. It's modern with its pop tunes turned into classical pieces and colorblind casting, but it also gives us a glimpse at the harsh reality women faced, in both high society and otherwise. The dialogue between characters shares some of that even more than the books did. Regency romances tend to glamorize the past, and the shows reminds us that while things are visually beautiful, the reality often was not.",10
"I'm a huge history buff as well as a lover of all things English. The first episode caught me off guard and I wasn't sure if I could wrap my head around the concept (I'm not familiar with the books) and casting. But as the series went on, I actually fell in love with the pure fantasy/uniqueness of it. The chemistry and smoldering attraction between Daphne and Simon was almost as good as Claire and Jamie (if you know, you know)! Anyway, is it historically factual? Absolutely not. But sometimes it's good to let go and enjoy a fun period piece with no expectations.",10
"Bridgerton is a delight.
I hope they make many more seasons. The sets and costumes are amazing. The actors are great. I love Shonda Rhimes production of Julia Quinn's book.",10
"Escapism at its finest. Gorgeous costumes, stunning sets, beautiful people. There's a ton of build up and heat and humor and passion, everything I want in the romance genre.It's a tv series based on a romance novel, not a historical documentary. It doesn't matter if it's not 100% historically accurate, that's not the point.The point is love, and Bridgerton delivers!",10
"Remember when we used to like watching soap operas and sweeping romantic mini series? Thank you Bridgerton for bringing back the addictive romance and fun. People whining about diversity and historical accuracy are completely missing the point. The show doesn't claim to be something it's not. Shondaland knoes exactly what it's doing and they are filling a huge hole that hasn't been filled for decades. Sometimes we just want to be entertained.I'm a huge fan on the Bridgerton series. For years I've wanted a film adaptation but a series is even better. The books are obviously better but they've done a great job of capturing Julia Quinn's wit, charm and romance. It's not a perfect show but it's perfect if you're looking for some feel-good escapism. Daphne and Simon's love story isn't the best of the series so it's only going to get better from here. Can't wait for the other siblings to get their stories.",10
"I'm loving the series so far! It'a supposed to be like gossip girl set in the regency era, and it's not supposed to be serious! Have fun, get lost in the fun. I read the books in my twenties and they were all silly and frothy. I mean how many dukes and duchesses and royalty were there for the characters to fall in love with?
My only problem... is that I wish Daphne was more like the character I imagined in the book. But still great show! And man the actor playing Simon is so handsome! This is a must watch!",9
As an avid reader I read this series through the years as they were published. It was a favorite. A screen play will never be exactly the same as the book from which it was made. With that in mind I was able to fully enjoy the series as its own and I was not disappointed. Thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining and I'm hoping for a second season.,9
"The best show in 2020!
The actors are so good in ther jobs that I feel I was living with them!",10
"I loved every minute of this. I've never read the books, I had no expectations whatsoever, and I couldn't care less if it isn't historically correct. It's Jane Austen meets Gossip Girl. It's romance, drama, and schemes. If you want a documentary, go watch something else. This is great entertainment, just as it was supposed to be. Merry Christmas!",10
I loved it so much! The characters are so amazing and talent! The story is very good and the appearance looks stunning. One of the most good series of the year and I can not wait for the next,10
I loved the series. The representation was fantastic and very important to construct a better world.,10
"This show was everything we've been missing on tv lately! Yes it has a diverse cast...get over it, I was amazed how beautiful the cast was and it being diverse only made the show better in my eyes. I haven't read the books so I can't talk about how true to the story it is, but I loved this story. I binged it in one day, I couldn't stop watching. I loved all the little nuances, the backdrop, the actors were amazing. I say you go watch this show and enjoy how the world should have looked from the very beginning",10
"The serie is not like the book, but I attempted to say it's even better.
The adaptation is there, with some differences from the book, but all the vibe, romance, drama and even funny parts are all over the place in so many beautiful ways to explore it.
As a fan of the books, I felt excitement, sadness, joyful and the most important in a romantic piece of art: I fell in love with everything. The music is spectacular! The cast choice is just perfect.Loved it so much.
Cant wait for the next season to watch Antony's story on screen.",10
"Very disappointed. bad acting and the actors are totally devoid of presence and charm. therefore, there is no chemistry, there is no passion, there is no beauty. everything very badly done, it seems that I am watching an open TV show for teenagers. ridiculous",1
"This is an amazing show! Just watched episode one and went right into episode two. This is a unique storyline with some historical context to it, abs incredibly well done. The costumes are so artistic and the townships are in the most perfect settings.
I am watching this until there is no more!",10
"If Shonda Rhimes, Chris Van Dusen, or whoever was responsible this series wanted to write a fictional regency love story that covered race, class and any other issue that plagues us in 2020, then they should have made up something of their own. Instead they took a wonderful series with such lovely characters and storylines and ruined it. I'm on episode 5 and I recognize NO ONE and NOTHING from the novels. It's breaking my heart. Honestly, the storylines, characters and actors are just awful and I'm struggling to watch this mess. I loved the novels and I truly hate this series. I don't know if I can even finish. Just plain awful.
DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!",1
"Bridgerton is just perfect. There is great representation in the cast, the wonderful story, impeccable soundtrack. I only have praise for this wonderful work.",10
The cast is perfect!!! We can see representativeness and diversity and this is amazing!!!COLORFUL BRIDGERTON,10
"I absolutely loved! The new characters fit perfectly into the plot, and the iconic scenes from the book are all present.",10
I loved so much this show. The picture is perfect. The cast is fabulous and so talented. I took a star because that specific polemic scene between Daphne and the duke. It was unnecessary and totally wrong. It was romanticized and we know it.,9
Super fun and exciting show with intrigue. The characters are all well done and I love the brightness and colours in the show. The broad and diverse cast is amazing. Would love some lgbt characters though!!,10
"I loved the cast, the details are excellent, I loved the diversity in the choice of actors, an incredible soundtrack",10
"I simply LOVED it, from loyalty to books to choosing characters. I think the thing I liked the most was the choice of the actors, I loved the representation they had with the main black character, the black queen etc.Even though racism at the time was indescribable, they changed that, and that was the best. I loved the sets, and I loved them, I just LOVED the costumes that look like they came out of a fairy tale (and were very expensive). One of the things I didn't like was how Daphne handled Simon's situation, and the loyalty to some characters, but other than that it was perfect.",9
"I was very excited to watch the series. The cast is amazing, I love all the actors. I think they could have eliminated a certain scene, but the rest of the series, I found it exciting. The main character, Daphne, had everything to be one of the best sisters, but ...",10
"As a lover of the books I was so ready to see the family I have fallen in love with come to life. Is it exactly like the books no BUT as an avid reader that has watched many adaptations this did not disappoint!!! While there are variations from the book they are great ones! I follow the author on social media so I knew going in she loved it so I went into it with an open mind. I can't get over how much I loved it!!! The colors are beautiful, actors are not exactly as I picture them but as I continued to watch I felt they fit better than I had imagined. I was also worried how they would handle putting 8 books into a series because I know it will more than likely not last 8 seasons. They included bits from the other books beautifully to satisfy this reader and those new to it to keep them interested. I can't tell you enough how amazing this was!!! Thank you Ms. Quinn for allowing your books to come to life!!! I hope many people are happy too so that we may see the rest of the books come to life!",10
"Love this show! So captivating and entertaining but above all else, the costumes are simply out of this world! The whole show is such a feast for the eyes.",10
"I particularly found the series fantastic, I loved the diversity of the cast, and I think this is just fiction, so it's ok to change things that didn't happen at that time. After all, the story portrays a novel and not a historical fact.",10
"On the surface, it has it all and so much potential.
Great period in History, High Society, Class, fantastic costumes and then it falls flat on its A**.
The story has been told over and over and over again.
Family with many daughters, Important of status, Jealousy, Macho, Honor and poor choices.
And poor choices are something that is so utterly repeated again and again that (I) find it unbelievable and boring.
Too bad .... and what a waste.",4
"I thought it was entertaining and not terrible but nothing special.
It would be nice if people realised that just about nothing in this show is historically accurate (not the costumes, not the hair, not the jewellery, not the music, not the dancing, not the way people speak to each other etc. etc....maybe just the houses they live in), so to say you have a problem with the diverse cast because it's not historically accurate is just plain stupid.
I personally found the chaotic and unruly mixing of completely modern and historically inspired styles to be annoying and distracting but the diversity of the cast members had nothing to do with that, and I thought the actors were all doing a pretty good job.
Anyway, if you're looking for a (somewhat) accurate historical drama just go watch something else, there's plenty of good stuff out there.",6
"Is it accurate to historical reality? No. Does that mean it's bad? Absolutely not! Finally a good costume drama, that provides jobs for both white and black actors! Usually I'm not a big fan of anything that's romantic or dramatic, but I'm 100% swooning over these series. And I really needed this, because let's be honest... this pandemic has been a real Debbie Downer to movies/series. Couldn't find anything good to watch for a while, until I found this!",10
"This series is perfect, it has a lot of representation, it was very well prepared, all the people in front and behind the cameras are to be congratulated. The work exceeded all my expectations, i look forward to the next seasons !!",10
"I cried so much and clapped my hands and squealed like a little child watching this! ?? We absolutely enjoyed this show. I watched it with my mom and aunt and we couldn't stop watching. We stayed up until 6am to finish it!!
I absolutely loved seeing Simon and Daphne's story unfold. Seeing their emotions and all of the drama. How fantastic! And my God, those are 2 extremely gorgeous people! ????
This show brought so much emotions out, I haven't cried and laughed so much in awhile watching a show! It was just absolutely so well done. The cast was wonderful, they all played their parts so well. This is such a unique and beautiful show. It's all about humans and connections. Family, relationships, love, fears. It is truly about US. I can't wait to rewatch it and relive all of the special and intimate moments. Life is about the connections we make and the people we love. So I will never be tired of seeing shows and films that celebrate this natural part of life. I also can't wait to see what little bits I might not have noticed the first time around!!
But aside from all of that, I have to say... Eloise stole the show for me! This girl. IS. AH. MAZE. ZING!! Just wow. Like, I have no words for this girl. She has stolen my heart. ? I would say my top, most favorite moments were involving any of these: Eloise, Peneloise, Polin, Anthony, Penelope. And, Sir Phillip!! I lived for these moments. I also adored seeing Benedict's parts, he is wonderful and cute and funny. Him and Colin interacting was great!! ???? And I loved any mention of their father, and the emotions it brought. I loved hearing any little back story from the Bridgertons, and I hope we get a TON more next season! I also totally loved seeing the bumble bee snippets. How extra! This was just so fun and so well done. If you haven't watched it, do so. There are so many ways in which people can relate to what these characters go through and deal with. It's an emotional and beautiful roller coaster.",10
"Thank you for so much representation, on top of the main characters",10
"Honestly, if you really enjoyed the books. Don't watch this. This was made for the Twitter bio lovers.",3
"Most of the characters had potential but they're bogged down by an incredibly boring drawn out story. Certain plot points border on innovative for the historical romance genre and then step back from the edge right before they cross over into something interesting. Every character with any originality was criminally under utilized or turned into a shallow Jane Austen clone by the end. Overall, they could've cut at least 3 episodes out and several sub plots that went nowhere. Really the only truly good thing I can say about this show is that Golda Rosheuval's turn as Queen Charlotte was absolutely excellent.If you like looking at attractive people acting out tired trashy romance tropes for 8 hours, this is for you. If you want satisfying story telling, skip it.",3
"There were many changes from the book. I didn't really care for the changes. There were added characters that didn't do anything for the actual plot except stretch everything out. Generally, the costuming was strange for some instances and while the Duke is perfect for the role, why was his costuming some much more avant-garde than the other male characters who wore proper ton style clothing? I understand what others are saying in regards to the diversity, but on that point, this is a fictional world that can look however the writer wants, however, I understand the reservations around that and if this wasn't an actual book first, I could suspend reality, but it's a regency romance first, which lends itself to certain expectations. All in all it's just OK for me. I'll watch this first season, but maybe not another. I'm actually kind of sad because a lot of the lighthearted fun wasn't included in the Netflix version. I just disappointed.",4
The show creators did a wonderful job adapting the book for the screen. This was more than I expected for a regency romance book turned tv show. I cant wait for more!,10
"It's like an adult, non-musical version of Brandy's Cinderella. Though set in the past, it's not historical. It's a lovely story with rumors and drama. A bit of ""gossip girl"" narration. It's a fun escape. The costumes and sets are picturesque.",10
"It is so refreshing to see characters and not colour, follow the storyline and not reflect on history, but escape our realities for a season.Bridgerton, is a 'what if' fantasy adaptation of an era gone by where the 'Ton' set the standard for respectability, acceptability, societal mores and rules of engagement.What if Prince Harry and Megan Markel were born over 100 years before their time (and Harry was in direct line for the throne?) then Slavery in the West Indies would have ended a lot sooner and not even been considered in the American Colonies. What we would have is a society filled with rich colourful characters that should be told.After all, we are only limited by our own imagination.",10
I loved this. Watched it all on Boxing Day. The characters are all really well done. The acting can be bit over the top but I think that's the point. I don't know what all of the bad reviews are about because I thought it was great.,9
"Central parts of this filmed fantasy aren't far from old fact. Back in the day King George III of England married Sophia Charlotte von Mecklenburg-Streleitz; a mulatto of the Portuguese aristocratic bloodline (who in fact actually looks like one of the female characters). They had 13 brown babies which ran all through the prominent houses of that century.The scenes are slick, the intrigue compelling - the minds of man are no-doubt the same now as always. Game, as it is played on an upper-class level of privilege and prestige. A good watch.",7
Bridgerton was really a welcome surprise this Christmas. It is much more than you can expect. Watch and be amazed by the most fertile family in high society.,10
"I loved the original book series so much! I really couldn't get enough! When I heard Netflix was taking this on as a tv adaptation I was so excited! but after watching their version of the series it left me feeling disappointed and a little broken hearted. The MCs that the Duke and I are are based on had no chemistry which had be bored!, they made pretty much all of the characters unlikeable that you were supposed to love!, and as this is a historical romance genre, it just did not have that feel to it at all!! There's a certain charm it needs and this show just did not have it.... I don't think I'll be wasting my time on season 2. Now I have to reread the book series to rid my mind of that awful show!!",2
"It is really good, i just hoped they would change the rape scene. i mean, there was no need for that scene and they made it look like daphne was a victim??????
other than that it truly is great",9
"I love the show! It's a welcome change from the typical royal family, uptight conversations. It is a fictional piece and I thank the creators for having beautiful people of all races included in major rolls. Does this make the show or break the show? Absolutely not! Do the modern songs played(on strings) in this period make or break it? No! Who the hell cares.. move on. Great show!
Ignore the 1 & 2 stars that may drop this one below a 7.8.",9
"I loved the series from Julia Quinn. Shonda Rhimes' reimagined characters, beautiful and realistic settings makes for an extremely entertaining series. Thank you Netflix for this Christmas present! And thanks for the diversity. Excellent acting all-around! Looking forward to Season 2.",10
Its a cute entertaining mildly predictable romance. The reviews would be higher but netflix dared to cast a few black actors and internet commenters cant have that.Ignore the bad reviews. Its a solid B+ if you like romantic dramas.,10
"Amazing, this serie is the best
I like this
I like history
I love everything and I agree a second seasson, for yesterday, pls",10
Not sure why it has less stars on IMDb. Didn't even felt like checking reason but I was hooked to it :) It's a period drama and beautifully made. I didn't like Daphne overly innocent character though . She reminded me of 50 shades of grey main lead. Also the her wardrobe so sooo dull.,9
"This show was so annoying. The costumes were horrible, it looked so low budget. Daphne was the worst- her dresses and jewelry looked like what a kid would wear, her bangs were horrendous, and I can't figure out the point of whatever they were doing with her eyebrows?! Everyone else had sculpted brows so it's not like they were trying to be historically accurate and it was plain distracting looking at her face. And although all the costumes weren't great, everyone else's dresses were much better than hers. Were they intentionally trying to make her the most unattractive person on the show? Eloise might tie for distractingly hideous dresses. But apart from it the costumes looking cheap, the acting and the dialogue was so boring. I mean it was a real struggle to keep watching it. I don't even want to blame the acting, maybe it was the script? I was so excited as I love period pieces and it looked like it was going to be campy and fun. I will be shocked if they actually make a second season. I won't be watching.",3
"This was just beautiful. From the costumes to the sets to the cast to the script. It was just one of those series, you know the ones I'm talking about, when you've watched the last of the episodes and you're sad that it's over. I wasn't concerned with who was in what role, why they shouldn't be in that role nor any historical accuracy issues. I just loved it for being the story it was. Beautiful.As a side note, I just want to know what happened to the diamond necklace that the Prince had given to Daphne. She took it off when she was on the bridge and that is the last we heard or saw of it. We were distracted when Simon followed her into the garden right after. BUT WHAT HAPPENED TO THE NECKLACE? :O",10
"Take all the bawdy soapy stuff from Riverdale and mix it with Downton Abbey's historical charm and you're getting close to what Bridgerton is all about. It knows it's a little outrageous, and it has a blast being itself.There are a lot of folks complaining about the diverse cast here... and these complaints should point to exactly how cunning this show is. It doesn't give a damn about history or accuracy and instead it wants to give a silly, sexy, and self-aware spin on a genre that is often dusty and stilted. This isn't a period piece for people who long to romanticize and reenact the era this is set, this is a period piece that longs to make people relish the absurdity and charm of period pieces.You can find the joy in this eccentric series if you see just how tongue in cheek it is. It's Marie Antoinette by Sophia Coppola reimagined for bingewatching soap loving audiences and it's delightful.",8
Great casting. It's P&P meets Gossip Girl if the Bennett's were rich and had a baseball team of kids.I loved watching every minute of this and watched it in one sitting. The plot intrigues you immediately; episodes packed a lot of story in 1hr. It's another Shonda hit! Hope there's a season 2!!!,10
Most people are only watching this because there is nothing else to watch. Very dull. Noting special at all. It will only be a success because in pandemic times there is nothing else to watch,2
I read the book about 8 years ago and it was true to the setting and mood!! I absolutely fell in love with the SIMON AND DAPHNE. The music and songs in this series are also beautiful as is the chemistry between our main couple. I recommend this series to everyone.,10
"I, as a black woman, am very happy for the role of Regé, for the performance and delivery to the character. Bridgerton is not perfect, there are things that could be resolved in another way but it was still amazing. Incredible characters. Thank you Shonda!",10
"I've only gotten to episode 3, but it has so effectively pulled me in, I had to pause to review. It reminds me of what an injustice it is that there are no physical markers of heartbreak - no bruises or scars - to keep a record of our agony when we love and lose. It's poignant and painful and artfully acted and positioned to elicit this sort of mournful, relatable feeling.More broadly, I highly recommend it for its fantastic costumes, decor, colour, and cinematography/lighting. Just absolutely brilliant. I love the diversity of characters, perspectives, and internal voices surfacing with consistency but still there is evolution. Just a remarkable show.PS, if you are looking for a new netflix boyfriend, Regé-Jean Page will do the job admirably. He's dashing in such a striking way, I audibly said, ""Wow,"" on more than one occasion.",10
"Good romance and good plot! I did read de books and the alterations are fine, didn't bothered me at all. About the black actors playing aristocracy in 1813, IT IS A FICTION! welcome to tv. Open your minds please. Really worth watching!!!!!!!",10
"The phenomena of color blind casting in historical productions has its origins with socially liberal British producers. In Britain, audiences are more used to mandated diversity casting by some networks in historical dramas which may or may not utilize color blind casting. However, typically American productions do not. I must admit, I prefer to see characters as they would look like in reality, not in a symbolic nature. There are some people who believe exactly what they see & I am not a believer in productions leaving more questions than answers. My opinion is historical productions can have diversity without misrepresenting history. In general though, thoughts about color blind casting are a matter of taste & style. There are no right or wrong answers.",5
"Absolutely loved watching this. The costumes, the acting, the story. I have never read the book but I do like the story very much that is being told. It's never boring as it switches between storylines and gives you multiple characters to pay attention to. I hope they come out with season 2.",10
"I absolutely loved Bridgerton! The costumes were gorgeous and colorful. I enjoyed how they took modern songs and arranged them to sound like classical pieces. If you watch period pieces, you will recognize some of the beautiful locations that were used. The acting was well done, and the storyline was interesting. For me, it ticked all of the boxes that make a period piece enjoyable. It was like a cross between a spiced-up Jane Austen and Gossip Girl. Enjoy it for its entertainment value, not its historical accuracy. It's not meant to be a documentary. I became so immersed in the story that the actors could have been purple and I wouldn't have noticed. I am eagerly awaiting Season 2! I highly recommend Bridgerton!",10
I've read all the books and am thrilled with this telecom series. Season 2 can't arrive fast enough.,10
"I've just binged this in 2 days (between children high on sweets and presents). Definitely not for someone who likes history to be just so but otherwise it's wonderful, colourful, intriguing and full of life. All the characters are played amazingly well and just like a good book you feel fully submerged in their world. I was sad when it ended and I will definitely be watching it again.",10
Totally binge worthy! I loved the diversity and the excellent actors they chose! Watched the whole season in 1 day and really hoping for more soon!,10
"It was beautiful. The story was complex and exciting. The cast truly drew the viewer in and brought the story to life. The scenery and costumes were elegant and brought the viewer into the world. The various storylines were raw, fun, and full of intrigue. Overall, it was a delight full of laughs, tears, and suspense.",9
Omggg... I'm in love with this show. I binge watched it in one day. I love them diverse cast and the plot. I don't want to say to much but I really hope they have a second season.,10
"So after debating whether to watch the edgy Bridgerton on Netflix, I did.
Some may see the full color cast and I applaud their modernization of an old classic but please don't miss the subtext.
The Black Girl gets pregnant out of wedlock and yes of course, the Black Duke is absent his father. Bravo Netflix and thank you for perpetuating another stereotype of old society. Let's not forget that these factual disparities plagued upon the Black race was forced and families broken up purposely to perpetuate a cycle of poverty and strife.I refuse to watch anymore after episode 2 32.15 minutes in.
As a man with a daughter living under my roof and fully supported by her mother and I, this makes me ashamed of those who still write scripts this way and act as if they're preaching solidarity or equality.",1
"For people who gave this series a low rating because they didn't agree with the diverse cast due to the time period, era or etc., please relax, no crime has been committed. It's just TV. This series has drama, romance, and comedy. Simply Entertaining. If you can't get pass the diversity and etc., then you will not be entertained because your stuck in your head to busy comparing your perception of reality to a romance book series or TV series.I remembered my mother watching the movie ""Imitation of Life"" when I was a child, and I remembered not fully understanding the movie until I watched it again at an older age. Being at an older age I also understood that Prejudice and racism didn't allow for a biracial black woman to play the role of a biracial black woman passing for a white woman instead they gave the role to a white woman. However I did understand as a child that the character was crying about her mother. If I understood that as a child, then what is It in the year of 2020 that people can not watch a show with diversity and etc.
""Bridgerton"" was truly entertaining.",10
"All one needs to imagine is Gossip girl in the eighteen-hundreds with the scandals and problems of the time period. A lot of the characters manage to stay quite distant, dispite good enough performances. The sex between the main couple is really emphasized. It got a bit boring. The problems and solutions were very simple. The season was ok. Those who enjoy silly romance dramas will love this. I say meh.",6
"This show was so addicting and so good that I finished the entire season in one sitting.
Bridgerton is awesome if you are an avid lover and reader of historical romance and regency England. It is so refined and elegant but the show still had me eating out of its palm with drama and mystique.Bridgerton is so full of plays out of the feminist playbook it's a wonder it works so well with a dated setting and society. Women taking control of their own lives, finding their own sensual pleasure without men, getting educations and being on the precipice of adventure. This is a world where racism and colorism is a thing of the (very recent) past BUT one in which a society moves forward and places people of color in equal positions of power quickly. And if you are not paying attention, it is hard to find out when that transition actually took place.This is not a show meant to be ""historically accurate"". As some have tried to relay towards their judgment on its entertainment value. This is a show in which modern (2020) music is given a classical and voracious touch of the orchestra. Where young readers, watchers and lovers of ball gowns, secret lives, courting and duels at dawn; especially those of color, can see themselves in stories that are predominantly white and elitist. This show hits all the high notes of romance and sensuality and violence and mystery and suspense and I cannot wait for the second season.",10
It was exciting and interestning and much love in it. And obviously based on a book,9
"I'm in love. Bridgerton is perfect, seeing my favorite characters come to life was amazing. Looking forward to the second season",10
"For those enjoy costume drama, this series won't disappoint but neither will it, I suspect, be long remembered. The writing lacks the confidence and humour of British shows in this genre. While the costumes and sets are as beautiful and sumptuous as we've come to expect, some of the other production decisions, like the CGI cityscapes and one particular horse riding sequence, are jarringly unconvincing. The acting is fine, only sometimes hampered by clunky dialogue which flips wildly between stylised Regency and modern English.It's entertaining escapist fluff and passes the time pleasantly enough, but I'm fairly sure I will have forgotten all about it by next week.",7
"Please ignore any review using the word ""woke"" or stating "" I only watched the first episode"" This is a great period series that only gets better with each episode. I am 5 episodes in and all I keep thinking is that I can't wait for season 2.Let us start with how BEAUTIFUL it is. The scenery, the sets, the costumes....perfect. It is steamy, funny, dramatic, and the ever lingering mystery of the narrating gossip columnist could not be more engaging. And no one can overlook the love scenes.....I found myself holding my breath a time or two?? IGNORE the haters and low raters....this is a fun one that many will enjoy.",10
"As a fan of historical drama I find this very annoying to watch, whether or not you can accept the concept of this being a re-imagining of the Georgian age for me the forced diversity still just feels... for lack of a better word.. forced! But apart from that it's the rich colours that every one wears, the perfectly manicured beards, tresses, make up. The modern dialog, the anachronistic music, I could go on.As a show itself it's pretty standard fare for modern young audiences But the object here seems to be style over substance. So while not dreadful, for me it's only watchable if you can ignore the slick pc correct production.",4
"It's been a long time since I watched a good romantic drama and I'm quite surprised to see low ratings for this show. I'm not familiar with source materials so I'm not going to compare each. The most admirable thing about this show is the way they mix modern music with classical music. The plot is a normal period romance story but the execution of the story is great. In the beginning, I was worried the pace is gone to be slow but guess what the pace is perfect. I'm sure you are gone enjoy this show so much as I do. The first half of the season mainly focused on our main two characters but in the second half of the season, there are few subplots that are good to see. I'm getting bored with romance drama when they focused on just the main couple. This is my first time seen these two performances and they did a great job, I really enjoyed their acting. They have great chemistry on screen. Also, the supporting cast is good especially the queen. The only negativity I see is the predictability of the show. Writers should have done better with the mystery of Lady Whistledown, I notice half of the season who is Lady Whistledown. I am looking forward to the second season and I recommend this especially if you are a fan of romantic period drama.",8
"This show was so wonderful! The drama, the costumes, the 1800s vibes, I loved it all! And such a refreshingly diverse cast for a bit of escapism. The plot was predictable and enjoyable, the wardrobe and sets a joy to watch, and the classical reimagining of modern music was a great twist. The whole thing was a treat for the senses from start to finish. I highly recommend this series to anyone who enjoyed Gossip Girl or Pride and Prejudice and anything in between. Can't wait for the next season!",9
"As an avid Julia Quinn fan, it's difficult not to feel a sense of disappointment during the first 15 minutes of Bridgerton. I have read all the books twice and followed her with excitement on social media since the series was announced. My feelings were a little mixed about the casting, but I knew that if this fit Julia's vision, it would work for me.When the series started, I felt like I was watching an episode of Desperate Housewives. Nothing against Desperate Housewives because I'm a fan, but that's not what I was expecting here. I wanted Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle in Pride and Prejudice. I immediately felt embarrassed to have recommended this with such passion to all my friends. I was disappointed. I almost stopped watching.And then I let go of my expectations about what I wanted the series to be and started to enjoy it for what it is. It's lighthearted and it's fun. I'm glad I didn't stop watching!",9
Wonderful and lovely story play. the duke and duchess actors doing it quite well. definitely renewable to 4/5 seasons. Loved it,9
"I just loved the series, it's perfect so far. I've watched it twice since it premiered and the two times I watched the only thing I did was look underway to my computer screen. The adaptation brought of course many changes, but the essence remained. The main couple is perfect, Simon is wonderful. Anthony can't say the same and I wish he'd get better next season. And that Benedict and Francesca have a real participation in the series, not only in their respective seasons. It is not possible for someone so to have liked this work",10
"The series did not disappoint at all...The main actors chemistry is fire and makes me want to see more. All the characters were amazing the only thing was I didn't get why the featheringtons had all the problems in the series. that was not fair ..When they "" burn for each other"" as said..it was magnificent.",8
"Loved every minute... well casted, beautiful sets.... bring on series 2!!!",10
"I was a fan of the novels. Julia Quinn is renowned for her quick-witted banter & her character - Lady Danbury - is an especially beloved old curmudgeon who infamously delivers the most rapier-like burns. Whoever adapted the books for Netflix is tragically devoid of any wit whatsoever. The writing is awful and so very unfaithful to the novels or even actual history that it is extremely difficult to immerse oneself in this travesty of a universe Shonda Rhimes has created. Terrible screenplay and woke-like revisions of history aside (I say this as a woman of color, FYI), some of the actors were absolutely dreadful. The amount of overacting we were subjected to by certain characters almost made it seem like they were playing caricatures of Quinn's originals. Abominable.",3
"I loved the series completely, the way Simon developed and how he was completely the same as the books, the actors are completely wonderful, I never imagined I would become a fan that easy, the friendship of Penelope and eloise captivated me from beginning to end, completely true to the books.",10
"Just like any adaptation, changes happen and when it comes to bridgertons they were very welcome, black people, feminist speeches and real problems.
Even people who didn't know the books are getting attached to the characters, we can only ask for a second season.",10
Eu amei demais. A fotografia. Os atores e o roteiro. Nao ficou cansativo e maratonei mesmo tudo em um dia!!!!! VEM SEGUNDA TEMPORADA LOGO CARAIIII!,10
Doesn't do justice to the books and the bad acting didn't help.,1
"The actors, the dialogue, the architecture, the art, the colors, the costumes. Everything transfers you to another beautiful world. You almost feel enchanted. It's just so beautiful.
100% a must watch!",10
"The adaptation didn't lose the essence of the series, its changes were not bad, the cast is perfect, I loved it",10
"This series was everything! It was addicting from the very first episode on and I binged it in less than a day! So so good! I highly recommend it!
The characters are brilliant! I will definitely read the books and hope for another season of this amazing show!",10
"Doth not a good make. Another ""new-age"" travesty. If you are making a period piece, albeit a whimsical one, the period facts and feel should be accurate. The acting is stilted most of the time, some younger girl actors are a little gems, but allaround the acting is uneasy and fake. Just as are the dialogues. The choices of the music are a sort of a bribe for a younger audience, but why? Massacres of perfectly good books is obviously a thing now.",1
"This series seems like a mix of Gossip Girl, Downton Abbey and a little bit of Pride and Prejudice. It does however lack the production value of Downton Abbey and the Script of Pride and Prejudice. That being said, it is an enjoyable watch and binge worthy. The actors and actresses are decent enough and the story - if not new - rather compelling.
It started out more or less innocent and became rather hot later in the season, which I truly didn't expect but felt quite new to this genre which made it a nice surprise. The series is very 21st century like. So don't expect a story, characters, costumes and the society to be all that accurate. It seems they wanted to do a more fictional, new take on this era and if it isn't sold as an historically correct show, I see no problem in that.
All in all it is worth a watch if you're looking for a light romance series. Don't expect too much from it, then I think you'll find yourself enjoying this guilty pleasure series.",6
"Bridgerton is impeccable. Soundtrack. Actors. Story. The 1800s are magnificent and bringing her to the screens made everything more incredible. The romance as it is portrayed together with the love of the family, its brothers, in all is an impeccable set. It is worth highlighting the actors' choices. Simon. It's. Perfect. Too anxious for a second season and Anthony's story. Netflix + Shonda = quite a hit. I loved it.",10
"I absolutely LOVED this series!! For me it was an amazing ride of love, challenges and desire. The character development and writing was phenomenal. The scenery and music were absolutely divine and fun! Such a unique and titillating period drama!! I will watch it several times over and if there is a second season to come, I will excitedly anticipate it.",10
"Despite the gloss, few characters are likable and the adult content was gratuitous and added nothing. Pity this story was left in the hands of an American.",3
"This was such a delight. Stellar acting and casting, the soundtrack, the story, EVERYTHING! Netflix and Shondaland are a match that can't be beat. I will be anxiously awaiting a second season!",10
"This was a delightful escape from a bad 2020. The story, costumes, actors etc were all very good. As to the comments about race, here's a bit of history for you; Queen Charlotte descended from the black Portuguese Royal line. She was black. Also, during the Regency period there were black aristocrats. Albeit few in number, they did exist. Nevertheless, this is a fictional account of a period in history told from today's rules where color of skin should not matter when it comes to characters in a show. Hamilton paved the way for this and I certainly hope it continues and we move away from typecasting in film.",8
"I haven't read the book, so I watched the show with no expectations at all and I loved it! I absolutely cannot wait for season 2.",10
"A perfect adaptation of Julia Quinn's books, In addition to having an incredible and diverse cast that brings a lot of representativeness, which is very important nowadays, and it's really sad that there are so many people talking badly about such a good series because of disgusting racism... Anyway watch Bridgerton !! it's a beautiful series and you won't regret it !!",10
Amazing show!! That's how book should be adapted. It was highly addictive and very juicy. I cannot wait for that second season!!,10
"While I was under the impression that I was watching something somewhat related to 1800s, I was distracted a lot by the adapted versions of popular songs playing in the background. Plus the characters are just too superficially portrayed.",3
"I usually love this kind og costume drama, but this one misses the mark. It has been hyped up by the press, but fails. I read that there war a ""sex coordinator"" on site during filming, but for what ? There is not a single scene in this series (first 3 episodes"" that even hints at sex.",2
"The show is incredible.
We need to talk about it: black people was not rich in the history because of the white people. So, please.... stop and accept that this should be the right.",10
"Highly hyped, this disappointed quite a lot. It's the Michelin restaurant equivalent of squirty cream. Light and predictable plot, deliciously over acted, a gentle Sunday afternoon viewing at best - I think the U.S audience will lap it up and think they've had a history lesson. Enjoy!",5
"This show is so much fun! The shows story is so addictive, it really reminds me of gossip girl. The scandals and the salacious gossip are really entertaining and exciting. The music is just fantastic, I loved the string versions of some of this years chart toppers including Ariana Grande and Shawn Mendes. We all need something to brighten up this bleak year. This has everything you could possible want sex, scandal, love and beautiful people.",10
"To everyone who's hating on Bridgerton1) I'm only 3 episodes in to the series but so far I've found it so refreshing and eloquently done
I haven't read the books, but I might start doing so because of the series2) I personally love that the cast is so diverse, it's a nice change from the constant all white cast in period pieces I've seen3) Historically inaccurate - Sure, Fine but it's a welcome change to see how women were terrified of the economic proposition that marriage was back then. It dictated their entire lives and reputation. When it comes to the social classes and hierarchy, it has always been relevant so to see it on screen shouldn't shock people so muchIn conclusion, I'd recommend to watch it. It has the hunts of period pieces we know and love (yearning, slow burn romance, suspense, and drama). It has a perfect combination of gossip, chemistry, well developed characters, and intriguing plot.
Now I'm off to watch the rest!",10
"I had no idea how many black members of the nobility there were in 19th century in London. Apparently it's an alternative London anyway, it seems permanently bright sunshine. It rains only 2 times, because it was conducive to eroticism.
I liked the chemistry between Simon and Dephne, but watching them have sex for a whole episode? Honestly? The show is for kids, but they're not allowed to watch it because of all the sex. Poor historical realization. If you don't understand history, you should leave it alone.",3
"I read and loved these books many years ago. I thought this show was gorgeous. It was never going to be an exact translation from page to screen, and I'm fine with that. It isn't totally historically accurate, but I'm not viewing it as a history lesson. It's a rich, sumptuous, engaging fiction, set at a particular time in London, with a fabulously diverse cast of great actors bringing Julia Quinn's original imaginings of a particular society to vibrant life.",9
"I read the books so long ago and loved them, so I was excited to hear about a Netflix adaptation. I loved it. I think it was wonderfully done. Though Shondaland took some liberties with the story and added plotlines and characters, it stayed true the overall story. I enjoyed it and can't wait to see what they come up with next.",10
I love this series. The characters are well developed.the landscape is beautiful. And the crazy match making balls are dazzling. Its nice to see people of ALL races and colors participating in LIFE. Not just boring white people. They also explain how the main characters became royalty and how that can change at a drop of a hat..this was a great escape movie..nothing more..the acting is fun also..I truly enjoyed this series,9
"I found the perfect series, the chemistry of the main couple is incredible ...",10
"I always loved Jane Austin themed movies and I am so delighted to finally see people of color included, I don't care if it is historically correct. The costumes are stunning, the love stories are captivating, the Duke is the perfect portrait of a real person with baggage like ours,a real man that needs to be loved. The music is incredible, I literally can't find one flaw to these series. You can't stop watching if you start.",10
"I binge watched the show in a day and then crashed into YouTube too see multifandom about the characters. Some commented that creators should stick to the original characters' appearances, however I have to say that seeing people don't judge by their skins color made me so happy. First in ""The Great"", then "" Bridgeton"". Keep making these true pieces of art. Moreover I can't explain how I loved the chemistry between Daphne and Simon. Costumes, decorations, casting all wonderful. I can't wait to see second season",10
Amazing just amazing!!! This serie needs continuation,10
Beautiful history and beautiful colorful. l love this romance,10
"You'll find many nods to Jane Austin in both expressions and situations. Thoroughly entertaining. Binged it in a single day. Not terribly original, but that's ok because I love how many balls they attend, the costumes, the characters....all of it.",9
"The series itself is alright. It had allot of potential but besides the cringeworthy genderroles. While black people around that time existed. It seems like allot of people are offended by the fact that a European historical movie contains black people in a positive position. While that actually existed, there is enough proof just do your research instead of calling it inaccurate.Ironically, the same people offended would care less if Cleopatra was played by a white blue-eyed woman in the middle of africa BC. Or all the other movies where main characters of colour replaced by white actors with allot of make-up. Pure irony. And I'm loving it. Lets change the narrative. Its powerful. If you are offended because you actually think Europeans should be superior in any time of history, you are a part of the problem dear.",6
"This is not historical I guess, it's just a light politically correct show, nevertheless I enjoy it, I usually watch it when I do my nails just to have something in the background. I am not impressed by the acting or costumes or anything else.",6
"I really love this show, the cast is so talent, has very love in this work... thank you for all dedication of all cast.?
I need SEASON 2! ??",10
I don't have a problem with the cast diversity (Hamilton?) I wish they would have used the music of that period as it would have introduced music that many of the viewers have not heard before instead of bad arrangements of mediocre popular songs. I just watched the first episode. It's OK. The acting seems forced and not really believable but the costuming and sets are pleasant to look at. The plot is somewhat intriguing and the fact that Julie Andrews is the narrator will probably keep me watching this.,6
"This is a teen approach to a period drama. Or maybe an American approach, it matter. The fact is that many of the main characters are not well casted. Some of them would be perfect choices for EastEnders or Coronation Street, but not for a period drama. Really, it reminds me of the typical High School American series, but set in the 19th century. The behaviour of the characters is not credible, to put is simply. The plot, such a cliché. When I heard Ariadna Grande and Maroon 5 in the background, played by violins, I couldn't stand more of it. Preposterous. Not credible at all. And Julie Andrews voiceover as if all of it was Wisteria Lane. I needed a G&T after approximately 25 min of it. If I watch the full series I would become an alcoholic.",2
"The plot and the story was very entertaining and utterly romantic. I was hooked from the get go and there wasn't one dull episode the entire season. The diverse cast was so refreshing and I ABSOLUTELY loved it. Binge it or watch it at leisure, it's worth your time for sure. I'm definitely rewatching it over again!",10
"Julia Quinn's ""Bridgerton"" on Netflix is a great adaptation of her work. Moving any book to the screen the writers have to select certain aspect of the storyline to keep it moving. So always remember the books are the books- the series is the series and never the two shall meet. Casting was done spot on!",10
"I fell in love with this family in the books and now on tv, even thought they changed a lot of things, the essence of the books are right there and I thank the creators alot for bringing my imagination to life!",10
Absolutely loved it. The show is romantic and emotional with excellent acting from the two leads. They are passionate and the chemistry is palpable.,10
"The series is IMPECCABLE! from the costumes, photography, soundtrack, the representativeness of the cast was wonderful and the cast itself is incredible ... it's just all perfect. a series to cry, have fun, learn from the characters and their evolution. I can't wait for the second season. it was all AMAZING !!",10
The series is amazing and the characters are wonderful. I'm in love with the Duke,10
In my opinion the best series ever created! The representativeness that the series brought is incredible. I'm in love and looking forward to the second season!,10
Season 2 can't come soon enough for me. And love Julie Andrews as the narrator!!,9
"Loved it, beautiful costumes and houses .great acting would definitely recommend",10
Splendidly and beautifully shot. Costumes and acting award winning. Netflix will sweep award ceremonies. Ma Rainey and now this both of these masterpiece in the same year from the same entertainment company. Netflix is legitimately the King of Entertainment. I bringe watched entire 1 season in 24 hours. I'm bored already awaiting for season 2.,9
"Yes, it is a show, not more, but I enjoyed every piece of it. I didn't read the books so had no expectations. But I loved the story, I loved the diversity in the cast, the utopian fantasy of having people of colour occupying high ranks at those times for me was genius, if only we could change the past... Very entertaining, just what I needed for a relaxing sunday while my husband watched his football.",8
"It's perfect! I really can't understand why some people are so angry for black actors they're playing white characters. When the contrary happens, don't have all this commotion. I think there's a word for that, right?",10
"I am a huge reader of romance and was extremely excited that this series of books was being made into a series.
I loved this show from the opening sequence. The vibrant colors, the people milling about, balls, the season. All of it.
I did not give it full marks because I felt the chemistry between this seasons couple was lacking.
I hope the success of this series helps other romance novels be made into series as well.",9
"The series is good, the actors are good and the story was not the same as the book but it remained similar. I saw all the episodes in one day. It is a romance, a fiction, it does not need to be faithful to the history of the time, it can be represented by actors of all colors. Simon is perfect, Lady Danbury too, they are by the way very similar to their personalities books.",10
"Incredible story, with a good soundtrack and a great cast. In fantasy everything is allowed, only not racism.",10
"I feel like I'm the same and even better than books, I'm in love with the characters.",10
"Wonderful and impeccable plot. The casting was just perfect. The black representation in the series was all good, it was magnificent to see black characters as the protagonist.
I love you, Bridgerton",10
Having read all of the Bridgerton books I can say this series is wonderful. The characters are portrayed brilliantly by the actors and have brought something more to each. I cannot wait to see what they do with the rest of Julia Quinns characters! For those who have issue with casting just stop. As readers we have the ability to imagine characters any way we wish and to see such a diverse group of actors bring these characters to life is impressive. I am going to reread the series with the bonus of having more depth to each character as a result of this first season. Well done to all!!,10
"I have not read the books nor need to . I binged watched the series, and couldn't turn it off. Loved the characters, loved the costumes, and enjoyed the story. It was an entertaining period piece and I loved it.",10
"You should be a fan of the series. Beautiful and so clever. I still don't love Daphne but that may because of Simon! :D Casting is perfection, the story is going in all the right places. Someone who is a true fan of the books will appreciate this series. It's gorgeous. Thank you creators for the bees. I'm just in awe!",10
"The show is perfect
The caracters, the cast, every things was made for us with so much care and atention
I loved It
Can't wait for the next season",10
I love everything about it. As far as live stories go it's got everything you need. Truly an easy watch!,10
"I loved the whole of color and scandal that the Bridgerton series created!!! I loved the thoughtfulness that was shown in including a cast of multiple races!! After the positive novelty of a diverse cast seeped in, I fell into the world that was created!!
I can't wait until season 2!!! ??",10
"What a marvelous show! My copies of the Bridgerton series are but remnants of the pristine books I picked up nearly a decade ago. I applaud how very well done the show is so far and I hope it continues this way or better. As an Asian American actress, it gives me hope to see that Hollywood is choosing more BIPOC talent for such roles.It's time for change. Change is progressive.",10
"Are you kidding me? Ok everyone has a right to their opinion. Coloured? The only coloured people on this earth are white. We go green with envy. Red with anger, white with shock! Etc etc etc This to me was an absolutely fantastic yarn! It bugs me that there is a shameful history. No one is proud. No one is innocent. No one can erase history. And no one should try! But for goodness sake! Go with the flow and just enjoy a fantastic blooming entertaining show! This is NOT a political platform. Still shocked that COLOURED was excepted!!",8
"I am a huge fan of the books and loved season 1!! The chemistry between Daphne and Simon is off the charts! I love the differences from the novel: the diverse cast, contemporary music, etc. Will watch over and over.",10
"I glanced at some of the reviews, and dismissed most.First, the casting was overall well done. The skin pigmentation is inconsequential as the actors embody the characters personalities. Focus on such things perpetuates identities linked to shades of skin rather than the content of ones character. Particularly impressive were Page's Simon and Dynevor as Daphne. They encapsulated the endearing romance and brought those characters to life. My only disappointment was that Page was not given the opportunity to bring forth further the anguish of the childhood struggle/speech impediment that sustained his fear of fatherhood and anger towards his father. This would have further developed his screen character. His portrayal of the duke's character was honest and honorable...but most of all, believable. Page actually surpassed any expectations I had for the casting of this character.Lady Danbury (Andoh) should also be given the opportunity for character development as her role within the novels is both a seamstress of matchmaking but along with that a wit unrivaled by other characters within the novel. Her banter displays her exceptional intelligence and insight.Anticipation for the next stories beautifully develops with the weaving of the characters throughout.Finally, the direction of the series seems to build in accordance with the book series with few exceptions. I look forward to Season 2, and I appreciate Netflix in its ability to seek out new opportunities for varied audiences.",10
"The movie was unconventional, but well written and entertaining. Great choice of actors. I can't wait to see if there will be a season 2.",8
"This show is charming, they managed to address current issues even though everything happened in the 19th century. The cast is impeccable and managed to clearly convey the essence of each character. The main couple Daphne and Simon passed a magical connection through the eyes and this makes any heart beating stronger. Long episodes, however, flow so quickly that they are not tiring. All my satisfaction for this show!",10
"Baffling that no one bothers to look up any actual history when claiming a drama and romance that never claimed to be historically accurate wasn't just that. Queen Charlotte likely was born of African and Portuguese descent if anyone cares to find it. Clearly from her portraits, she wasn't white so it's not so far-fetched there could be other royals descended from other moors and the like. Even if not, slavery wasn't that visible in the UK. Not like America. They weren't picking cotton in England. They used slaves in their other colonies where they had money in sugar cane and spices etc. But if you're that bent out of shape over the mixed race casting or that it's not like the books or that they mix in string quartet versions of pop songs, it's called creative license. Stop whining or having purist ideas of what this should be. The rest of us are enjoying a bit of escapism - yes what is essentially Gossip Girl in an Austen novel - during quarantine and this garbage year. If that's not your thing, no one is stopping you from watching something else.",8
I really loved this series it was like watching a romance novel on screen and the guy that plays the Duke he is scorching the writing was phenomenal and the acting on point,10
"I'd say this series is one part love story from a woman's perspective, one part contemporary, and one part idealist future world where race is (almost) a non-issue.",8
"Amei a adaptação e como é inclusiva!
Os irmãos da Daphne são super carismáticos e o casal Daphmon possuem uma ótima química.",10
"I genuinely loved reading the book series and was very excited when I heard about the adaptation. I just finished watching the 1st episode and while it is obviously a lavish production, I am not pleased with the changes in the way the characters act and behave. I'm not talking about the unique casting - all of the actors are talented and beautiful to look at. What displeases me is the apparent changes to the actual characters. They do not speak, act, or behave like the characters in the books. The names are the same. The setting is the same. The plot premise is pretty much the same but I am very put off by the changes in the actions and speech of the screen characters opposed to the print characters upon which they were based. Beautiful costumes. Beautiful set. Beautiful people. Lousy adaptation.",1
"I haven't read the books that this series is supposedly based on, but why should we really care how faithful the adaptation is? Shouldn't the production sink or swim on its own merits? And all this discussion about whether it's appropriate to have people of different races playing historical figures. In the case of this production, I think discussions of race, feminism and historical accuracy deflect from the fact that it is... boring. If you enjoy watching the same over and over again ad nauseum, tune in. It's a photocopy of almost every PBS period piece I've ever seen. And photocopy in the sense that it's not quite as good as the ""originals."" And there is certainly nothing original about this story. The acting is okay - I doubt Netflix will garner any Emmy or Golden Globe acting nominations from Bridgerton. Costume or cinematography nominations? Sure, why not. Really all I can say about Bridgerton is... m'eh.",4
"I love the books. I'm reasonably happy with the show but ... why the heck is there so much smoking to relax? Frankly it throws me so much out of the scene that I scarcely know what Eloise is saying. Honestly the time for cigarettes has come and gone. These are barely disguised. I'm probably the only person who doesn't think smoking is cool nor do I find it at all sexy or interesting,
Some of the casting choices probably piss folks off but I'm ok with such changes.",7
"Knowing nothing about the books or what to expect from the show, I gotta admit that the diversity threw me in the beginning. By the second episode, I became colorblind and grew completely enchanted by it all that I didn't want it to end.
Although I loved it, to be quite frank, in a way it made me sad. All the diversity.. well, it made me see how the world COULD have been and needs to be.
I eagerly await the second season!",9
"Watch it for what it is, pure entertainment. This is not a history show, why judge it as such. I loved it so much that when it came to the end, I re-watched immediately. I love each of the characters and can't wait for more.
People are so fickle. I'm not in to horror, therefore I wouldn't watch half an episode and rate it poorly. I'd simply go watch what I enjoy and leave it to the horror fans to give a genuine rating.",10
"Pride & Prejudice meets Gossip Girl with a sprinkle of 50 Shades LOL I actually really liked this series and hope there is a second season. Production was beautiful, storyline was captivating and the chemistry between the actors was great! I highly recommend",9
"Lovely romantic period piece that was never meant to be a history lesson. It lightly delves into the absurdities of propriety that still plague our culture today, while elucidating the struggles of women, poc, and LGBTQIA, both in history and our current culture. These topics are just barely touched upon, and instead are illuminated through an entertaining and romantic filter. For those of you who are cringing and complaining about the historic inaccuracies of having poc in starring roles, I would warn you that your racism is showing. This was was never meant as a historically accurate piece (with its larger than life fashion, music and society); if your problem with this series are the poc, then I would suggest your problem does not lie with historical accuracy but instead with deep seeded racism and the advancement of poc within our society. Otherwise you would also be crying that ""Thank you next"" by Ariana Grande was playing at the ball.",10
"Absolutely loved this show, i love the connection between Daphne and Simon (the chemistry between those actors is amazing), the photography, music selection (that modern touch was like breathing fresh air), the wardrobe and the color palettes for each family was so detailed!Perfect for binge watching 2 or 3 times!Thank you Shonda for giving us something great this 2020!",8
"It's disheartening so many people gave this show bad ratings because of the color of the actors. I have not read the books, but LOVED how they were able to rewrite it to include a diverse cast. The book is completely fictional, so changing it around to be a juicy diverse love story brings in more viewers. This was not meant to be a historical representation of the 1800's. For myself seeing people of color play Queens, Dukes, etc. was so nice and refreshing to see because our history was taken from us. Biopic's are cast to represent the true identity of a character and fictional stories are made for rewriting to bring in the masses. So, if you can't see past the color you need to take a deep look at the yourself as a person because you really missed out on a great show! Blacks, Asians, Latinos can play any role in a fictional show and guess what it does not change history, but I'm sure it made a young child of color smile to see people who look like them get cast for a role they normally wouldn't get cast for.",10
"This came up in my ""recommended for you"" list a couple of times, but did not capture my attention. I love period dramas and so yesterday I decided to embark on the series. Captured my attention immediately and held it through the entire series. The storytelling is enjoyable and none of the stories are too laboured, but there is sufficient character development to have you invested. A definite 10 out of 10!!!!!!",10
Binged watched in 2 days - i really hope season 2 comes out soon,10
"Gorgeous, witty, innocent, sexy, poignant, colorful, sexy, quirky, relatable, fantastical, perfection...did i mention sexy? I have not read the books, but plan to now. Im a huge fan of period series, Poldark being my favorite, this is just as enjoyable, with more hot moments btwn the lead characters. Satisfying in every way. Going to rewatch from start to finish once i post this review!!! Dear Netflix, PLZ RENEW!!! We need more!!!!",10
"After reading some reviews I expected some terrible woke, badly written and asinine story but after watching it I found this series quite delightful, interesting and engaging.Granted I have never read the books but I enjoyed pretty much all characters and story lines and the acting was quite good!I hope there will be more!",8
Couldn't stop watching. Loved the romans and story and it the story has some twists and turns I wasn't expecting. Soooo good!!!,10
"Idk why people are upset that the show is not the exact same as the books, that's kind of the point of adaptation. The creative liberties from what I have observed were great! The show is bright, the story lines are not difficult to follow, and you really do feel immersed in this world.I think at times some things were a little annoying, but overall I would say the show is pretty good! Also if you're mad that the cast is diverse....just don't watch the show. I found that part to be especially cool since looking back at history would tell a different story. We can kind of imagine a world where all people are treated similar, are able to have similar ranks, and basque in their individuality (I mean seriously just look at allllll the different hair styles and textures it's really beautiful).Good job Shondaland!",9
"This is such a great show! The best I've seen this Christmas season. Shonda Rhimes certainly knows how to tell a great story. The cast is fantastic. Rege-Jean Page is to die for, and the chemistry between he and Daphne is perfect. I've seen some reviews that say the show is shallow, pretty but insubstantial. And I haven't seen anyone mention where the real substance comes from. It's the unbelievable situation of the women of the times. They didn't know how babies were made? Incredible! They had no idea what happened on their wedding night? Ludicrous! This is as feminist a story as Shonda has ever told.I was actually brought to tears when Daphne told her sister Eloise that she believed she would make her own way in the world. It's so sad, to me, that we have been kept down for so very long. I applaud Ms Rhimes and her excellent producer, Chris Van Dusen, for giving us a beautiful, light-hearted comedy/drama that also speaks out on female disenfranchisement. Bravo!!",10
"I love the show. It's a spiced up regency era drama series that I think Jane Austen herself would find amusing. But would she be equally as appalled at the continued sex scenes? I found myself cringing at the Granville house 'parties'. Not exactly something I expected.
Other than the unnecessary amount of sex thrown in, it's a good show. I do hope for a second series. C'mon Netflix and etc, don't let us fans down.",8
"Loved the show, the cast was perfect, the story addicting, I can't wait for season 2",10
"It starts out as a fantastic and beautifully done period drama with amazing costumes, sets and hairstyles and then the sex starts. And it keeps going. And going. And going. It gets to a point that you just fast forward them to get to the next part of the storyline. It's a great up and down love story but the constant make-up sex is boring and loses its point. Otherwise a good production.",8
Didn't know there were books but definitely going to be looking it up. Regè-Jean Page and Phoebe Dynevor had an amazing chemistry. Binged watched the whole thing in one day!,10
"This is a very good start to what I hope will be a very long series.
As a book lover I couldn't be happier.
I'm sad to see the bad reviews; people must keep in mind that this is fiction, and it is a very good production.
Congratulations to all the professionals involved, I think you are on the right path, please don't let the negative reviews throw you down. All the book clubs that I belong to, absolutely loved it.
Don't keep us waiting long for the second season.",9
"I have no issue with the diverse cast, it shouldn't make a difference to story telling unless the piece is heralded as historically accurate in every way. Because of that I also don't care that the costumes are at times, beautifully elegant and then in other scenes look like an explosion in Laura Ashley! Again, that's not why I give it a mediocre score. I watched four episodes back to back and just could not really describe four hours of story. I felt that just nothing really happened. It felt a bit repetitive rather than a sharp game of wits played by the two lead characters. This is of course my review and my opinion.
I find comments such as ""check your privilege"" to be quite offensive to the people who wrote in here. This is a movie review by normal movie watchers. Does being a hard working, reasonably successful white woman preclude any opinion that allows freedom of expression? Lest you be judged as a racist!! This is where inclusivity and changing the norm may fail as opinion and thoughts are judged and repressed.
I didn't give a rats fig that three of the main characters were privileged black characters including Queen Charlotte! I only thought about it when I read a comment on Facebook. Am I surprised given some of the rhetoric that black actors would be involved in a project about the privilege of riches on the back of slavery? Oh no. That's right, I actually don't care because actors are adults and can make their own choices on who to portray and of that portrayal fuels the legacy of that period. Bravo to everyone I say. It's entertainment.",6
"I had read the books a long time ago and when i saw the trailer for the first, i couldn't believe they were being adapted into a series. I was nervous at first, because adaptions rarely match the expectations of fans and this genre of books are well never really adapted.
Having now finished watching the series, i would say, i loved it! The series is very engaging and fun. The diverse cast was distracting at first and difficult to ignore. But by second episode it made sense and made the series even better! The casting for Daphne was perfect! I could see myself falling in love with her character, she acted so well.
The only thing that left me wanting was that I would have loved to see more of London of that time through their eyes.",10
"Perfect, the cast is the best! Wonderful to see my Bridgertons, all very beautiful.",10
"The series is just perfect. A gift for book fans, as the adaptation captured the essence of the story and all the important references are there. I'm looking forward to the second season.",10
"It was so rewarding to watch this show, with this spectacularly amazing and charming cast. Rege Jean as Simon was amazing, it looked like he was born specifically for this role, it was extremely satisfying to see him. Not to mention Nicola's perfect performance with Penélope, it was lovely.",10
"Can't wait for the next series. Easy to watch, and I couldn't stop watching .",10
"I highly recommend giving Bridgerton a watch especially if you like romantic dramas. It's a lavish delight of a drama in a opulent setting. It's important you don't expect the subtlety of Austen - yes, this is a Georgian era romance but written and then adapted for a modern audience - but in simplest terms, smash Austen with Gossip Girl and you get Bridgerton.So yes I've read all of Julia Quinn's books and love the Brigderton family. Is this the same? No. Is it therefore bad? Also no. I just do what I do with every other TV show/movie of books I love and compartmentalise them into separate things. The characters are somewhat different from their book selves, but from what you can see from the first season, it allows greater character development to occur that is more fit for the TV screen. I loved the inconclusion of Marina, a minor character from the 5th book in the series based on Eloise story, it added extra depth to the series.I have a history degree and read voraciously so yes, I'm aware of the historical inaccuracies. However, I'm also aware this is a work of fiction, a delightful romp through a somewhat Georgian period of English history with marriage minded mamas and men trying to avoid the parson's trap. I'm not watching this looking for a history lesson, and if you are you're doing life wrong.The use of POC actors is vaguely explained with a comment partway through the series to do with the King falling for a POC and marrying her, thus making way for an inclusive society, but to be honest I don't think it was necessary. The best people for the roles have them. Despite comments on the woodenness of acting, I think the casting is great, particularly Adjoa Andoh for the society matriarch, Lady Danbury, Nicola Coughlan as Penelope Featherton, and Regé-Jean Page as Simon Bassett, The Duke of Hastings. The actors do a great job of injecting life into the script.The only character I was unsure about the changes for was Daphne - she is younger in the show than in the books, in her first season rather than her second. I think some of Daphne's depth is lost due to this. Book Daphne was beautiful but men quickly saw her as a friend (something to do with growing up in the country with 3 older brothers and being particularly close to Colin, her closest in age). She wasn't desperate to marry and indeed new she didn't have to (the Bridgerton Viscountancy wad thriving and if any daughters chose not to marry they would always be supported) but did want children, thus concocted a scheme with Simon to have her seem more desirable. Turning her into someone who cares about not much more than making the best match does the witty, gracious character from the books a huge disservice, losing some of her close relationship with her older brothers too. I feel like her character is the only real change from the book that I take issue with. Hopefully they can keep a little more true to the essence of the Brigderton family characters for any additional series and their own stories.",8
"You can rely on Netflix to splash the cash when it comes to a series of this kind, and Bridgerton doesn't disappoint with beautiful houses, lavish parties and exquisite clothes. I found myself suppressing a laugh at some of the men's hairstyles which made them look like 1950's Teddy boys, which I am sure was not intended.
It's a handsome series - the Bath settings are thoughtfully and artfully reproduced, and the plot is better than average with a whole string of Bridgerton siblings needed to be married off. Everybody seems to happily live with what seems like the double standards of the era, and Julie Andrews' Lady Whistledown is a plot masterstroke.
I am really enjoying it, even if it seems to veer between Mrs Gaskell, Jane Austen and Jilly Cooper. It is very good entertainment and I am looking forward to a second season.",7
I Love the adaptation! Let the second season come!,10
"Bridgerton is a reimagining of Regency London and it deals with a young aristocratic woman looking for love and a financially adequate husband in her aristocratic circle. I was fooled by the trailer and yesterday I gave it a shot.Unfortunately I couldn't go through the first episode. Even as a ""reimagining"" of 19th century London, it is frivolous, caricatural and foolish. The plot is shallow and the acting unbearably overplayed. Since it doesn't have much to say, sex scenes are scattered here and there together with ridiculous dresses, vests, hairstyles and wigs. Dialogues seem to have been written under the influence of alcohol.The queen looks and behaves like a fishwife and as such receives her guests lying back in her throne in an overcrowded narrow room, which makes me wonder if anybody in the production has ever visited a Royal Palace.Even the opening credits are horrendous and badly made.Do yourself a favor and skip it.",1
"Great production!! I'm always unsure when books I like or love are translated to screen. I read every genre but still have a soft spot for my Georgette Heyer, Austen and other good regency romance writers. Bridgerton is very well done and I want the rest now. I'm very happy with the, A Knights Tale style slightly modern/different take with regard to music, dancing and costumes. The wit and humour of the books is not coming across but that may not be a priority for this production. Even so I'm sticking with my 10 star rating.
I'm already watching it over again and have new Bridgerton converts in the family. The proof was when I asked on Christmas Day did they mind if I watched the first episode just to satisfy my craving and then we could do whatever else they wanted. They then insisted on watching the lot! Never did that before.
I also liked that they used actors of colour to portray some aristocratic families or servants just the way it could have been if not for slavery or prejudice. Very interesting.
Thank you Netflix!! Thank you Shondraland!! Second series please!!!",10
"It takes a clever team indeed to take a historical romance book series, which focuses on the happily-ever-after one one couple per novel, and make it into an ensemble cast with a strong through-narrative. Yes, many changes were made when comparing to the source material. Yes, the costumes and events aren't meticuously period-accurate. But the unique effervescence of Julia Quinn's Bridgerton family books is what has been brought to the screen. The decision to offer a female-focused, female-gaze perspective to Regency life, sex, self-actualization, and identity in love is what we needed from this new historical romance series. The spirit and overall arc of the characters is what Van Dusen and Shondaland have given us, and that is what matters most.",10
"Incredible actors, wonderful production, great script and does not deserve the racist attacks he has been suffering, because it is a series of FICTÍCIA history and not historical (based on real or historical facts, but yes fiction). Accept that there will be black protagonists YES! AND ALL ARE GREAT ACTORS.",10
"To evaluate a highly produced series with 1-2 stars just because there are black characters is RACISM
where is your sense? black people exist and deserve to be portrayed equally to whites in cinematographic works, there is no use ignoring
and about the ""excuse"" of the time, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD IS A FICTIC SERIES, THERE IS NO REASON FOR THIS TO BE A REQUIREMENT FOR ONLY WHITE PEOPLE IN THE CAST",9
Held your attention which is impressive given that not a lot happens. Some of the characters could have been developed more but no doubt there will be further series. Thought the overall storyline around the oath a little weak.,8
"Love this adaptaption of the first book. Is it true to the book 100%? No, but it keeps the original vibe of fun and sassy and keeps a viewer entertained. Watched the whole season in one sitting!",10
"I love this series.It has brought all the characters I love to life and I spent 8 hours enjoying the opulence of Regency life, the loving and maddening Bridgerton family, the scandals, the extra story plots giving the characters more depth and of course the passion.The creators have made a brilliant job of bringing Julia Quinn's stories to life and giving a fresh, enticing feel to them.I will always love the books but this series has made them come more alive in my imagination now.Now for the long wait of series 2",10
"I wait 5 ages for this, and I love so much. Penélope & Colin are the best couple forever!!!",10
"The choice of black actors was at least interesting. Is that a problem? Not really. In a perfect world, people would be bothered by the lack of black actors in period adaptations and would try to understand why. Perhaps that would solve some issues in today's society (yes, we live in a world that is still racist, don't be so shocked).
What was not that interesting was the breaking of customs, it denies the history more than the presence of black actors. I am confused by the need to integrate the society of the 21st century into the 19th century. But was it enough to make the show a disaster? Again, no.
Now let's talk about what really makes it a disaster: the books.
When Bridgerton's rights were acquired, it wasn't the big hype or the large amount of books sold around the world that were bought, it was the story, and that's where the production failed miserably.
Bridgerton is about family, it's about mutual support and love, a lot of love.
Each character is an important part in the construction of this family, somewhat eccentric for the time, but still functional and highly respected in society.
The production gave us none of this. It turned the books into a reality show.
It delivered a foolish Anthony, nothing like the responsible man that are always concerned about his family that we see in the books. His story with the opera singer was shameful to watch. It completely destroyed his character in exchange for nothing. Anthony is a libertine, yes, but leaving the family aside to be with his mistress? Wanting to introduce her to the society? Act like a passionate and jealous man, when everyone who has read the books knows that romantic love doesn't interest him for personal reasons? Completely hateful.
Violet did not show herself as the loving and respected mother, Colin was not the charming gentleman, Lady Danbury was not the sarcastic and rude woman that everyone loves to hate. A complete change of personalities.
That was the real problem of the show, the lack of fidelity to the book and its characters..
I don't care if the show is going to be portrayed on Mars, in the year 3000 full of romantic alien couples. But when you say you're going to adapt the story of a book, do it. Do not create a new story, this is not your role, the author already done that.
That's what I expected from Netflix and Shondaland.
If you haven't read the books, or even if you have read it and liked the adaptation, very good for you, really. You don't have to agree with me.
But if you read the books and didn't like it, like me, let's just hope that the second season will be more faithful and brings out the best of the characters.",1
"I usually don't like romance movies or TV, but I really fell in love with Bridgerton! And all the romantic drama that came with it!!! What a marvelous storyline, actors and costumes. There are so many twists and turns in the plot that I was never bored... not even for a second. Well done!!! A must watch!!! I can hardly wait for season 2!!! Please hurry!!!",10
"I love watching costume dramas and literary adaptations, especially at Christmas. The period in which this is set is my favourite, being a long-standing fan of Jane Austen, but this is very different. That said, I love the costumes and sets and the insight into Regency society.
I know a lot of people have issues with the casting of POC, and I know it isn't necessarily historically accurate but people need to get over themselves and just enjoy it for what it is. The Duke is as handsome a leading man as any other literary hero, and it shouldn't matter what colour his skin is.
I haven't read the books so I don't know how accurate it is but it's entertaining enough. As a friend and fellow costume drama fan put it: 'any costume drama is better than none at all'.",6
"It is good more weak performances and could be better and if you have a 2 season that fix the mistakes.
Personality changes I didn't need because in the books they were very good and even better than presented in the series.Maybe if I had never read the books and saw how Just inspired by the books I wouldn't have expected anything much better and in the essence of the books.",4
"When I learned there will be a Netflix series based on Quinn's Bridgerton books I was very excited for it. Now after watching all episodes (and it was very painful watching it I must admit) I'm very dissapointed. Like some others I wasn't thrilled about very benevolent casting, but let's put that sideways and focus on the transmission of the story about Daphne and Simon from the book to the screen.
There was only very few moments which I recognized from the book. I'm really trying to understand that netflix had to have a show and stuff but it's really hard to do so because they basically ruined one of my favourire book. Many of the sidestories(NOT in the book originally) were very unnatural to Quinn's vibes and very unnecessary. I don't know if J. Quinn had any word with how this is gonna turn up, but to me it feels like there is 1% of the book and rest is... well rubbish. Let's face it....
It's hard to explain to people who have not read the books how devastated I was when I saw what they've done to Anthony and I'm not talking about the plot with his mistress. I'm talking how they created this monster brother who forces his sister to marry a man she does not desire when in the book is exactly opposite.
How Simon and Daphne told everyone their courting was just a game (eventually) except Anthony who was the only one to know it in the books (from the very beggining). The situation about Simon lying Daphne that he cannot have children and everyting following that situation. Except the duel scene and the bedroom scene(which was only partly like in the book) there was everythintg wrong. The complete queen storyline was absolutely unnecessary.
And then few unimportant details like Daphne isn't in her first season, Daphne's hair colour, that their first, second or third child is not a boy and so on and on.. That are some details which can be quite easily transmited to the series but for some reason they haven't done that...
And not to mention they told everyone who is Lady Whistledown right now... In the books you don't know (unless you figure it out on your own) until the middle of the book 4...
I have to give some stars for beautiful locations and some acting.. sometimes..
If you are not a fan of the books I guess you could be able to like this. If you are a fan of the books there are two possibilities. One is not to watch it at all and stick with the books which are so beautifully written or you can watch this and appreciate the books even more.
If there is next season of this I beg creators... stick to the original story. It will be much better.",3
"If you haven't read the books, you simply must! Julia Quinn is a genius at making romance novels not just romantic, but hilarious, charming, and addicting. The series is wonderful too although there are certain liberties taken (as there always are when taking a book to the screen). It's binge worthy for sure!",10
"Is the best, is so beautiful!!!!! You must see it immediately. You won't regret it!!!!!!!",10
I haven't seen such a good show in a long time. It only took me a day to finish it. All I can say is that I can't wait for season 2.,10
The characters are so cool and the actors play very well. Even convinced me that I wanted to live in the 1800s.,10
"I created this IMDB profile to review this series. Lots of folk chatting about it being too woke got me going. To be honest it has a million historical flaws, it inaccurately portrays the period so badly that one almost can imagine a vauxhall corsa coming round the Royal crescent to pick up the characters. It is still an amazing watch which I thoroughly enjoyed. For those that go on about the actors being the wrong shade of pink, please get over yourselves and watch it for what it is... beautiful, perfect escapism. Loved the black queen she was fierce and majestic, the ""English roses"" were very good at swooning, the leading man dashing, there was amazingly camp slapping and prancing. What more does one need during lockdown???Please watch this for what it is... not what it should be! If you need historical accuracy, watch a documentary instead. If you enjoy a slightly camp romp with lots of costume and intrigue, then pour yourself a gin and enjoy it.",10
"Muito bem ADAPTADA, roteiro incrível, fotografia impecável e o elenco é MARAVILHOSO. Um elenco diverso e representativo o que atualmente é essencial nas produções.",10
I Saw this series and despite being a little different from the book i liked Very mutch. the resemblance is incredible and perfect in some scenes. And the differences between the book and the series are necessary to make the plot more vivid.I do Love this series and became perfect.,10
"The series is amazing, a litle difference to the books, but in this format it was incririble.",10
"... I know I do. The novels sparkled and were a delight. So fun!To be fair, the TV series does have great costuming and sets, but that's pretty much it. In fact, the producers seem to make that their biggest focus, instead or character development. The casting is just wrong, the story isn't fun at all, and the gratuitous sex is just ... well, gratuitous.",1
"I've read the books a few years ago and was amused by its wit and interesting plots. I was pleasantly surprised when I heard the books are finally being turned into a series. I have to say I am also pleasantly surprised by the diverse cast and hope I see even more of that in the future. Yes, this is not a dull British period series, we already have plenty of those. What we really needed was something light and funny and as further as possible from 2020.",10
I really enjoyed this series!! I didn't read the books so I didn't really care that it doesn't follow them exactly. Oh and I have an open mind so I didn't really care that there was a black queen in that time period. Geez people!!,10
"I absolutely loved this series, once I got it straight in my head that it is not another Downton Abbey. Other than the fact that it states it is set in 1813, nothing about this show is historically accurate. There is not even a nod to propriety or history, but don't be disappointed by that. Enjoy it for what it is, a wonderful fictional show. The costumes in the first two episodes are wonderfully flamboyant and entirely over the top, as are the sets and scenery. You get a full data dump in the first episode, so be ready to absorb the characters in all their impropriety. After that most of the costumes are toned down, almost to the point of being boring. There is romance and intrigue happening all around you, so keep a sharp eye. If you blink you'll miss too much! The story line and acting was delicious. I loved every character and am ready to binge watch it again! If you're looking for a very good synopsis of each episode check it out on Vulture.",10
"To start I have not read the book. Somehow it did not cross my path even though I love period books as this. My favorite author being Georgette Heyer and Jane Austin a close second. I am from a diverse family myself and have no issue with creative license to make a fictional story that does not match historical accuracy if it understood it is fiction and it took such liberties as it did, an example being modern tunes played by an orchestra. But, this series does not live up to its potential.While the settings and costumes are vibrant the characters are lackluster, dull, boring or annoying like Eloise. The characters did not come across as they should by either bad script, bad casting and at times both. Pen's character is the exception and came across as the most believable. She portrayed real and true human emotions and was neither dull or annoying and the actress played her well. Overall this is a series to watch if you in the mood for a period piece and can overlook the liberties it took and dont expect a masterpiece as some give it but it not a total garbage rating as haters gave it., so in the middle rating i give it, no more than that, too much dull writing and bland characters to give this anymore than a 5 or 6 star rating.",5
"I don't normally want to watch things like this. I will admit to that up front. Wife has waded through enough of my SciFi preference I feel I owe it to her. Sometimes I can be happily surprised. This was not one of those times.My biggest complaint is it just wasn't good. I sat through a lot of Greys Anatomy and while much of it was cringe worthy some of the story arcs were interesting. I probably gave up on that show after no less than 5 years, maybe 6. I was shocked to learn it was still going strong a couple years ago but apparently people like it. Brdigerton is based on a novel(s?) that seem to be highly acclaimed, which initially led me to believe I might enjoy the show. I get the impression they seriously misfired on the original material.I have never been what anyone would consider a prude but I think a show better be able to stand on its story and the nudity should just be unnecessary window dressing. This show will be fine for those looking for window dressing. Everyone else need not apply.Meanwhile, we are really getting swamped in this 2020 wokedom. Novels have always been the best medium for creativity but woke is destroying period fiction/non-fiction unnecessarily. Series and films should be trying to create the settings as laid out by the author or go write your own material. It would be just as distracting if Kunta Kinte first ran into the slavers in the forest, it was Jack Nicholson out hunting a guinea. As fine an actor as Jack Nicholson obviously is, he would have ruined that film (rather the producers would have should they have made that casting decision).I am not going on to episode 2. Show gets a 3 because production quality and actors do well.",3
Not worth watching. What a disappointment. Netflix should use their money to produce better shows.,1
"The series managed to tell the story beautifully by inserting issues of diversity and important themes without changing the essence of what is told in the books. The changes that appeared served to add drama and as a connection for the next seasons. I loved the cast, the scenery and the costumes. The soundtrack with current songs played by the Vitamin String Quartet is a bonus. Great entertainment. Looking forward to the second season.",9
Modern life ideas on period dramas! Not bad i must say. But whats the point? Made in C /only way is Essex vs women's rights? We are not getting out of the wigs here are we?,6
"Vivian Leigh, a Brit born in Calcutta played Scarlett O'Hara, the daughter of an Irish plantation owner in the American South
Natalie Wood, the daughter of Russian immigrants, played Maria in West Side Story
John Wayne played Genghis Khan; Burt Lancaster played Cochise; Mickey Rooney played Japanese in Breakfast at Tiffany's.
People only object to diversity casting when it goes agains their prejudices.
And diversity casting or not, this series is great...especially for those who wouldn't be caught dead reading a Romance novel.",10
"I really like the book series and this first Netflix season (book # 1) does justice to the feeling of reading them. Romantic, beautiful, sweet moment, funny dialogues and heartwarming about a delightful family. Nicely done, genuine romance feeling and a big: I like. Looking forward to more.",8
"I was enchanted in the first episode, I'm completely in love. I can't wait for the second season",10
"Simply in love with seeing this adaptation of one of my favorite series!
Especially the fact of bringing black characters, this is incredible, we need to see ourselves at the top too! Do not get attached to the historical period, your racism will not pass!!",10
"Loved this series. The costumes, the use of the English language, the scenery and the Queens hair. Julie Andrews is icing on the cake. Highly recommended.",10
"First sat down to this and was amazed just how OTT the PC brigade had been in this. Some worked like the Duke and the Queen but the others were certainly not cast for their acting skills. The main characters were distinctly unlikeable, however the duke Simon was quite tasty to the eye. As was the rather attractive Anthony. The only characters I actually liked were the aforementioned Anthony, Eloise, who was actually a revelation and I rejoiced every time she was on screen and Simons guardian. What annoyed me most however was the obvious lack of screen chemistry between the 2 central characters.",5
I didn't read the book nor do I enjoy period dramas but DAMN this was good!!! The chemistry between them is soo damn palpable. Also the costumes are so wonderful and I just love the casting. A wonderfully fun romance.,10
"I really hope I'm missing some big trick here and no one is genuinely taking this seriously. Please tell me for my own sanity that viewers at least realise it's absolute trash, as either a romance or a drama, but go along with it for the pompous, costume-y ride?Historical accuracy is out of the window, but as it is fiction, that's fine. But woe be all of us if our media consumption returns to the 'boobs and swords' era of the late noughties that this series mind-numbingly revitalises.The age rating certification given to this (15) actually surprised me, mainly due to the fact that anyone of viewing age or above shouldn't find anything contained in it as exciting, novel, shocking, nor interesting.Sniff.",2
"It's definitely watchable if you don't mind the repeated bonking towards the end which gets annoying after a while and there is no way on this earth that a regency duke would be talking to a debutant about masterbation! If those two comments put you off then it is not for you. I like the large non white casting except on one point which is referencing the King marrying a black woman where as Queen Charlotte was definitely not and she was also much more in love with her husband and genuinely distressed by his condition than this rather callous and wholeheartedly unlikable character is. Cast a a black women in the role but be colour blind to the casting as in David copperfield, don't rewrite history to make a point. If you want to understand a better history of the era then watch The Madness of King George which is closer.",8
Frothy American soap fantasy with curious cultural misappropriations - I got through half of episode one before deciding life was too short and precious.,1
Good production. I did not read the books so I can t tell how were they adapted. I don t mind the diversity issue. Good vibez,8
"Let us speak of a simple truth. If you are ok with people waltzing to Shawn Mendes 200 years before he was born, ok with women in their mid-30's playing young teenagers, ok with huge anachronistic liabilities yet are not ok with a black duke, a black Queen, an interracial relationship, a black man with a white servant, then you are a racist. Whether you like it or not, you are a racist. Grow up.",10
"I'm a huge fan of period dramas, I've watched all tv and film adaptations of Jane Austen's novels and other classic period pieces, so when I heard about a new show set in regency England, I knew I had to watch.Years ago, I also read the book series by Julia Quinn on which this series is based, and even if I don't remember everything, this has always been my favorite of the lot and the one I remember the most.While not exactly the same, I believe this is a very faithful adaptation, at least in spirit, and I loved every second of it! The actors, the costumes, the sets, the music everything was excellent and vibrant. Indeed, this series, reminded me of the movie Emma, which came out last year, and was a more modern, racier adaptation of the beloved Austen classic. I appreciate the use of a diverse cast, and don't understand what the fuss is about really. All the actors were great (particularly the actress playing Lady Danbury), and now, I can't imagine reading the books again without picturing them in my mind. I really hope they continue adapting the other books too!In conclusion, this was a beautiful, sweet, funny, sexy show, that I highly recommend to all the fans of period dramas and books. Forget about historical accuracy and just enjoy the show for what it is, you will not regret it!",10
This show was so easy to binge and fun to watch. I am glad I didn't pay attention to the bad reviews.,10
"Brilliant costume, sets, scriptwriting and acting. Could do without the 'skin colour' speech in episode 4, I'd come to terms with it not being historically accurate in the first 20 minutes - I didn't need an explanation. The splendour is just lovely and I really enjoyed immersing myself in this series. A good series about love and responsibility.",7
"Loved it! I love the books, and because I have been disappointed before with adaptations of books that I really like, I did not create expectations about Bridgerton. Best thing I've ever done! The adaptation is really very good in every detail, and even the small changes in the narrative were very welcome. And the detail I liked the most, apart from the cast (which is just wonderful), were the songs that served as background for the balls. I loved that contemporary touch.",10
A must watch. History and fiction meet for pure entertainment. I loved the idea of the 1800s coming to life with many people who were different. Looking forward to session 2.,10
Missed some of the scenes from the books but overall 10/10 would and will watch over and over and over again,10
"Fantastical soap opera period piece.
The diverse cast is utterly swoon-worthy. I also appreciate all the new faces - none bring prior characters they're known for to this story.
I'm keeping fingers-crossed that there's more seasons to come (apparently the book series are 8 in total - one for each Bridgeton sibling).
Aside from the main characters, I really enjoyed Eloise played by Claudia Jessie.",10
"To all the people who are writing reviews based on the races and nationalities of the actors...you realize that this show is fiction, yeah?",9
"Bridgerton was an delicious dreamy Christmas treat! It was such a fun and totally sexy show to watch! The costumes, sets, music and acting were delightful escapism fitting for the last week of a challenging year.I was not a long time fan of the book series but read them once I saw the preview for this show. I started reading romance for distraction and comfort during the pandemic and was excited to see a romance novel used as a source material for tv! Just like all romance novels the plots of the Bridgerton book series and first season of the show are predictable and formulaic but comforting at the same time. You know there's going to be problems but things will come together in the end. Don't come looking to find a shocking unexpected plot. That being said you will find characters with depth and beautiful stories about love, vulnerability, and family. I was happy with the adaptation of the characters and the changes they made to the plot.I'm disappointed with the negative reviews regarding the diverse casting. I understand the need to be aware of not erasing history but that's not what's going on here. Bridgerton is a fantastical 21st century romance story set in the 19th century. It's refreshing to have black actors cast in a period piece. It's refreshing the see Rege-Jean Page play a duke in a romantic lead. I never got the feeling that Bridgerton was trying to do anything but provide a romance with representation. All the haters need to get over it and really look into their hearts at why a black duke in a fictional story bothers them so much.Winners:
-Anthony: Jonathan Bailey was the best actor of the ensemble in my opinion. Fans of the books might be disappointed in how Anthony struggles in the show but I think they gave Anthony's character so much room to grow.
-Eloise: she was a joy and even more fun than in the books. She provided as space for feminist critique of the restrictions of their society.The actors had amazing chemistry and it showed!Criticisms:
Don't be mad... I loved it and can still have critiques...
-The diversity was amazing but I did notice that almost all of the black actresses were light-skinned and there were very few dark-skinned actresses with speaking lines. If you're going to have a diverse cast it might be a good idea to be a bit more conscious of that.It didn't go unnoticed that they chose to cast a black woman for the role of Marina, one of the only tragic storylines from the series, and they expanded it with an secret pregnancy! If you know the books you know her story is not a happy one. Just a bit disappointing to add a black character that doesn't get to have a happy ending like everyone else.Consent. I was wondering if they were going to change the Daphne/Simon conflict in the show but it was even more glossed over and downplayed. I felt like they could have done a better job at addressing consent and trust in Simon and Daphne's relationship.Overall I loved it even with its flaws. You should watch it if you are looking for a pretty romantic drama.",9
"The show is amazing, and embodied the soul os the books and characters!
The casting was AMAZING, the soundtrack classic yet modern, the scenery delightful!",10
"It's a Harlequin Novel. It's a Harlequin Novel. It has a big budget and some trendy/edgy choices that try to hide it, but in it's soul, IT'S A HARLEQUIN NOVEL.K, now you know EXACTLY what to expect, plot, writing, romance, and character-wise.They stuck some modern day glittery gunk on it to make it more appealing to a younger audience, who might be in denial about liking the same historical-romance-novel guilty pleasure as the 40+ crowd, and to make it seem like more than it is.Expect things like garish, modern fabrics in the costumes, explicit and plentiful sex scenes, and harp versions of Ariana Grande songs playing at the balls. And the diversity cast everyone is gushing over is tailor-made to distract the 15-25 crowd who would otherwise quibble about the traditional, patriarchal romances (I'm not buying it. If they were doing true Hamilton casting rules, WTH are the Asians? Where are the Hispanics? Either have an actually diverse cast, like in ""the Personal History of David Copperfield"", or stick with a historically accurate one)You'll either find the modern touches fun, or deeply grating on your soul (if ""A Knight's Tale"" bothered the bejeesus out of you, avoid this. If you thought ""Reign"" level costuming and historical accuracy wonderful, you'll be fine) I somewhat feel a more accurate setting would let one appreciate the full junk-food romance of this better, since it would remove the posturing and trying to be edgy and relevant, and let it be what it is, a Harlequin Novel.As for book series accuracy, I'd say it's about as close to the books as the ""Ella Enchanted"" film is to its source material (which is to say, not really, and set in a different world. Book fans, you have been warned.)I wouldn't watch this with other people. It's the screen version of that-time-of-the-month chocolate: intended to be consumed solo, shamefacedly, and voraciously once others are out of the room.",5
"I have never read the books. I was skeptical when I saw the unusual casting but I gave it try because the Duke is very handsome. And it was awesome. I didn't like the weird casting of ""Cursed"" but this one is perfect. Forget about colors, history and races just look at the beauty of everything and enjoy.",10
"Seriously I'd expect this type of show from Americans not the British, everything about the series is nothing new to me. I have seen countless stories like this show and honestly am bored, no mystery, intrigue nothing at all to keep me interested... only character worth watching is the girl who prefers to live her life rather than obsess about marriage, I don't think they handled race well in the show, I think we all know what black went through then, why sugarcoat it and make it seem like white people and black people then saw themselves as equal in England, am black but I'd prefer they made it how it really was in that era, it was weird seeing how black people was represented in the show.
another thing I like about the show is the cinematography, whoever did all those background scenes and finding such beautiful locations deserve a Grammy, I was more interested on how beautiful the town is than the story itself",5
"This serial looks pretty, and appeared to promise an interesting new angle on regency period drama, in the same vein as The Knight's Tale and medieval England, but it turned out to have major flaws. Above all the sheer quantity of gratuitous soft porn sex scenes...maybe this works in a certain segment of the US market, but I doubt that it will please a more discerning UK and European audience. I could eventually accept some of the many glaring anachronisms (eg Offenbach's 'Belle Nuit' in 1813?!), but why on earth use the very well known real name of 'Cliveden' with locations which are quite patently nothing to do with that place?
Period fantasies can work well, for example the contrast between Bridgerton and the wonderful Harlots series is massive. Hard to believe a second season is apparently to be dredged up. Bright points were some of the acting performances, notably the Duke and Duchess of Hastings, Lady Danbury and the Duchess's mother.",3
I don't have much to say except I stopped watching it after 3 episodes. I tried to like it but there was nothing to like.,1
"I wanted to love this show, and for the first half i really did! the costuming and casting is amazing. it's a lot of fun. the string covers of modern songs was a nice touch. i liked a lot of the characters and enjoyed getting to see a variety of relationships develop. and i was really rooting for daphne and simon, at first. but (*SPOILER*) the rape in episode 6 left a bad taste in my mouth, especially the fact that it went completely unacknowledged. regardless of simon's lies, daphne was absolutely in the wrong, and yet daphne is made out to be the victim and simon is forced to apologize and give her what she wants anyway. i absolutely despise daphne and i couldn't root for them after that, no matter how badly i want them to be together in the beginning.",5
"I agree that it's totally ok to rewrite history with diversity. I also have no preset notion of whether it was true to the books, but the writing and directing make this feel like a C level Hallmark movie. I don't blame the actors but, the director has purposely gone for what is a very ""presentational"" style of acting. Like on a sitcom. Each piece of dialogue is performed almost ""to camera"" as if each actor is doing a monologue. Their movements are really big, like theatrical plays and this removes any emotional resonance OR historical accuracy for me. Having been addicted to British period dramas for years, it's the tightness, the emotional understatement of people in society at that time and the characters desperate to break out of it. That's what's compelling to me. This has none of that which, to me, is the ONLY thing that makes it fall short of its status as a historical drama.I'm super sad this didn't work out. Super, super sad. I think Shonda Rimes is a genius and I absolutely crave seeing talented black actors. Just a shame. Glad it's a hit for Shonda and company, because it flips the finger at all the white male executives who have throttled ideas like this for decades.",4
"Well this TV series really turned on my tears, the plot twists kept me on edge and the gossip was amazing and historically King George Was losing his mind unfortunately, every family was struggling and no one had a perfect family. What an amazing diversity in the cast although this diversity did not exist in England it felt good that it existed here in this series.",10
"I have not read the book, so am new to this story. Loved the characters, the diversity, the romance, the strong female characters trying to assert themselves in a time when women were anything but independent. Romance, mystery, intrigue, real life messes, and good messages. Thoroughly enjoyed it.",9
"If you have nothing to watch and are looking for some casual teenage heartthrob trash TV this is it. The only surprise is, it's not set in a high-school but rather in the victorian era. The story had me cringing at every step with almost too frequent sex scenes. There is no villan or remotely likeable character, just a bunch of annoying people making absurd and nonsensical decisions and having sex while doing it.",1
"If you are looking for historical accuracy this isn't for you.
If you are looking for a show with gorgeous costumes, sets, and a damn sexy leading man who happens to be black...this is a dream come true. The casting truly feels like ""right actor, dont care what their race is"".
The actors are perfectly cast, the chemistry between Simon and Daphne is strong, and the humor *just right*. Wonderful adaptation!FAQ:
Yes they ""explain"" why black people are in positions of power. No they do not focus on race, truly it is only mentioned 1x (maybe twice?) and never any talk about biracial couples. In this world people are just people.Yes there is sex. A lot of it. Dont watch with your mom if you aren't comfortable seeing sex scenes--lots of naked male butts, some boobs, thrusting and seeing a man go down on a woman. It's intense for like, 5min montage and a little bit at the start of episode 1.Yes there are major changes from the book. They don't lose any of the important pieces and the changes make sense for a TV show-- new characters help move the plot forward and new story lines flesh out the siblings we didnt get to know in book 1. Approach this show like a fan's retelling of the story and you can enjoy it.Can't wait for season 2!",9
It is simple if you wanna escape the harsh world we in it even if it is as temporary and short as 8 hours it will do the job and do it perfectly.,10
"I have not read the book. It's a fantasy novel, OK. I have no problem with the cast diversity - it's the sole redeeming feature. I just can't understand why anyone would make such crap. Why engage such a talented crew to produce rubbish like this?",1
"Simon and Daphne's relationship was very sweet. In some places the drama repeated itself, it was a bit boring but in general I had fun and liked it",8
"I am shocked and saddened to hear the other reviews, because it has ""Africans in it."" Art is subjective, and movies and TV and be created in anyway. If you can't get past the diversity I'm sorry but you are the problem of the rest of us not moving forward in society. This is the stuff Prince Harry and Megan Markle are trying to change. This show has great harmony, great acting, the Cinematography, and music selection very good. Costumes are exquisite as well. This piece really shows at the end of the day being diverse we still have gender issues in society, but it also shows that we can progress. I find this show charming makes you yearn for more and give at shot! Please give it a shot wiht out I'll judgement.",8
Love this series. Im actually rationing the episodes to prolong the experience.,10
Why those songs horrible dont suit at all dont they even have to pay for them. Useing an fifty shades resemblance not an smart move to use someone who already excist.But actors other hand were decent.Easily can watch this not painful.Dont know how they managed to get allmost hour long episode would have guessed like thirty minutes.,6
"I will admit, I have not read the books, but that's okay because this isn't a book review. As for the television series, it was captivating! The sets, wardrobes, etc. were precise and obviously created with precision. The actors all hit their mark and played their roles exceptionally well. Just like any story, you learn to love and hate a few of the characters.The series was exciting to watch and I wanted more as soon as I finished the first episode! I wanted more love, more lies, more sex, more betrayal...all of it!For those reviewers upset about POC playing queens, dukes, and high-class individuals, get over yourselves...it's fiction for goodness sake. This isn't some biography or documentary.
Yes, the story does include historical elements; however, most viewers comprehend that what we are watching was soley meant for entertainment, and entertained we were!",8
"I have not read the book series so I watched this with no expectations, and I thoroughly enjoyed it for what it was - entertainment! It is not a historical documentary and that's the beauty of it. It is historical FICTION for the modern audience; it is make believe - a world where there was racial diversity amongst the most elite in society (and it's all the better for it). I have absolutely no problem with switching off from the nightmare of 2020 and, instead, watching beautiful people (in beautiful costumes) entertain me for a while. It is definitely no Jane Austen or Brontë - but that's a good thing. Those are the classics and will always remain so. This is a lavish and modern spin on the genre. I thought that all the cast and crew did a fantastic job and I'm looking forward to more escapism with the next season.",10
"So disappointing to see all of these bad reviews. Full disclosure, I have never read the books, but I can understand that some people may get attached to their personal idea of a character. However, I (and perhaps anyone else who has an imagination and loves when modern touches are added to periodic tv shows/movies - ie: The Knight's Tale) absolutely love it. The chemistry between Simon and Daphne is untouchable. Their storyline is heartfelt and lovely. I love all the characters, although some of their storylines are a tad bit boring but I imagine they will get better as the show continues.
I urge anyone with an open mind (and heart) to give this stunning show a chance.",10
Loved this show so much. Great to see a diverse cast executing the script with wit and brilliant acting. Highly recommended. Those complaining about the cast's diversity are showing how racist the world still is. Sad.,10
"I'm really in much more love with the series. Is very inclusive to all the races and the chances were better for the ""tv formats"". Hopefully we'll have asians on the royalty soon too",8
"I've never read the books, but I was really enjoying the series as a whole until Daphne basically rapes Simon in episode 6 and the remaining episodes obviously have to deal with the fallout. I've since found out that something similar happens in the books, so it's accurate to the text, but it really turned me off from the rest of their arc in the series. I'd be interested in watching another season of the show, but primarily for the secondary characters in this season. I was immediately intrigued by Eloise Bridgerton, Benedict Bridgerton, Colin Bridgerton, and Penelope Featherington and, following episode 6, these characters, along with the sibling relationships and friendships between these characters, really carried the series for me.",7
"Don't expect historical accuracy, just roll with it as a fantasy Regency world and you'll be entertained!I'm someone who can be irritated by the too obvious in your face wokeness and political correctness but in this case it didn't bother me at all. Yes there are people of colour playing it it. Does it matter to the story? NO.It's mainly a show about romance. There. If you don't want to watch something like it, just don't, but do not leave sour comments just because you don't like to see coloured people in a regency show or without having seen the whole thing. And btw in the theater coloured people have also been playing ""white"" roles and that has been accepted as normal.Okay I could write a whole essay about the issue above but I'll now give a review about the show itself. The showmakers don't claim to have made a historical accurate show. It is good they have done that because it really is modern. Maybe a tad too modern for my taste, but oh well they wanted to reach a wide enough audience...As a ""fan"" of the Bridgerton books I am happy with how they adapted the books. It's not entirely the same and it shouldn't be.There's not enough story in the books to carry a tv-show.You can tell a lot of work and care has gone into production design. The show looks great!I show was lighthearted with some heavy elements and for me the balance of this was just right.The main romance is executed well enough as you can expect from this genre.The acting itself is good, the actors did as well as they could've done!Jonathan Bailey playing Anthony Bridgerton is maybe for me the most outstanding role as he seems to have a more complex personality. A surprise to me was Ruby Barker playing Marina Thompson! She could acted her funny and heavy moments out with ease. And Nicola Coughlan as Penelope Featherington was also an eye-catcher for me. Her portrayal was spot on.However some elements of the show could've been fleshed out a bit better I suppose. But these kind of shows are almost always lacking a bit of depth.The show is great at what it tries to be so just enjoy it as it is! A solid 8 from me (I would've given it a 7.5)",7
"While the ""queen married a dark skinned person and then created equality"" was a bit jarring at first, I got used to it and was enjoying the show at the beginning. Even with the Ariana Grande music played by orchestra. But then, there was a bizarre twist where the show turned into what was essentially porn. Every episode had minutes soon minutes of sex. The main character raped her husband... he was saying ""no, no, stop"" but she wanted to be pregnant so she forced him to continue. And this was portrayed as a good thing. This was one of several ""women, take your power, trick men"".Honestly, I never read the books. But this was not a good period drama. I love period dramas and this one was just bad. There premise had promise. But the execution was abysmal.",1
"I didn't even know there was a series of books until I started reading the reviews and I do sympathize with those who are not happy with the adaptation... For me, it was fun, I like the characters and to be honest, it was refreshing to see a diverse cast on the screen. Yes, the costumes are gaudy and OTT but this isn't a documentary and was never meant to be. I disagree about the chemistry of the 2 main actors and find it very believable. Might want to look up Queen Charlotte's ancestry before throwing any more criticisms around about her appearance on the show. Was very interesting.",7
My only complaint is the contortionist that performed for Queen Charlotte in one scene was wearing stiletto heels which weren't invented until about 1950!,8
"The series, in my opinion, has more strengths than weaknesses, like the great costume and the perfect soundtrack, and the scenario wins over anyone, and the actors' choices would not change any, from my point of view, even the series being at the time, I see no reason not to choose black actors for the roles of royalty, since the stereotype that black actors can only play slaves or butlers, does not help in the fight against racism today. (my opinion)",10
"I guess they tried to compensate the hollowness of it all with sex scenes, poor writers tend to do that when they cannot come up with anything else more enticing.
But even if we excuse the amount of sex scenes that add nothing to the plot and honestly even cheapen the show, the rest of the story is horrid.
They make a god awful attempt at portraying the struggles of being a woman back at that time, only to present a bunch of girls and women that actually have pretty good lives with no worries. Even Eloise, who tries to represent the need of women to take a different course, doesn't actually do a single thing for herself.
As to Daphne and Simon's relationship, i only have one thing to say: EWWW!Honestly, just a show about a bunch of rich people going to each other's houses and having no real concerns in life. Just the thought that this show is set during the Napoleonic Wars era, which gave way to Tolstoy's War and Peace, is an insult.",4
"I thought it was just fantastic! I cried, smiled, danced, and fell in love. Definitely my favorite show of the year",10
"Historical fantasy and period romance are a fantastic way to reimagine history. Episode 4 really hit me hard. It gives you the imagery you always wanted....costumes are fantastic....and then gives a depth I search for in reading romance books. Yeah I wasn't exactly sold on the main romance...mostly for the woe is me whining of the privileged couple madly in love. Luckily you have a whole cast and menagerie of storylines to follow and invest in. I can't wait to see what happens for these characters and I wholeheartedly love the boldness of saying WHAT IF we hadn't bound entire races of people in enslavement, social inferiority and servitude....where would we be today IF we had had an equality movement nearly a century earlier. Also the queen is a kicka*# character and I could watch her comedic performances all day...not to mention her turn for the drama",8
"The show itself is quite boring, however I really like the colourful cast - at first it's strange, since it's a period drama, bet strangenesses goes away quickly. And then I am seeing just actors, not their colour.We shouldn't be surprised if we see a black royal. Maybe it's not historically accurate, but we shouldn't be thinking that ""royal could never be black"". This opens our minds - the history could have been different.If we always portray royalty as whites, servants as blacks - it would stay so for longer. In our heads and in reality.",7
"This series is so freaking amazing. I got the feeling as if I were in this era all through the episodes, from the costumes to then characters, the love story and just everything about it. A MUST WATCH.",9
"Is it historically accurate? No, is it ok to change history to suit THIS TIME, absolutely.
I don't get the absolute ignorance in all the comments. Color of the skin doesn't matter, the costumes and sceneries are beautiful, the dialogues funny, the story engaging. That's it.",10
"What an unpleasant show. If I wanted to see sordid sex, ho hum costumes and bad acting I could watch any number of Netflix shows. I was shocked how bad this was! And really, if you don't want to present a period piece then perhaps pick a different project!",1
"It's quite fun as long as you don't take it too seriously.
Do pay attention to the music at the parties/balls - Billie Eilish, Maroon 5, Shawn Mendes, Celeste, Taylor Swift, ...
A good distraction in these complicated times.",8
"There are couple of wealthy families constantly having costume parties and trying to impress each other with their posh accents. To be fair i have no interest in 19th century British society life. Maybe that's why i found this so boring and pointless to watch. There are some jokes involved but i don't get it. Only good thing about this show is inclusivity of people from different backgrounds although it's historically not accurate for that day and age. I cannot say anything about acting of the actors and actresses as not sure if they were supposed to act bad. Anyways, it's over for me after 3 episodes...",3
"This is series is so much fun! I absolutely adored it. I shared my enthusiasm about this series with my friends, and we've all raved about The Bridgertons. We can't wait to see which couple the writers will focus on next and tell their stories of scandals and romance. Praying for a second, third and fourth season to come!",10
"This is a drama for the times ( 2020s) . The sets are amazing, stunningly so. The costumes well thought out. Queen Charlotte, the King's Wife ( George III) is interestingly Afro-Caribbean and her staff dressed in court dress of around 1750. Courts as we know, never move with the times.
The dialogue and themes are 21st century. Jane Austen is sufficiently replayed that one can watch that for authentic period dialogue
No one has four daughters ""coming out"" at one time. Each one came out in a different year and had to find a husband by the years end.
Lord Berborough visits ""at home"" without visiting cards. More shocking The Duke has no cravat at a society ball !
A servant wears his bicorn hat crossways - 'like a ship in full sail' coming towards you. The last person to do that was 25 y prior, one Horatio Nelson.
The more modern way was as the line that one walked.
At one At Home, the lady of the house converses with the visitor - who appears to visit without a manservant - whilst two daughters play cards and one a harp. The girls of course should be around the visitor listening to what she had to say
Excellent drama, and I recommend it to everyone. As for - did it ever happen once? No, it is a drama.",8
"To those that say it's not historically accurate, a la the mixed cast, I say so what? It got me to imagining what an integrated world at the time might have meant for us now. It's ""Emily in Paris"" across the Channel at an earlier time and I loved Emily in Paris. The deeper you get into the story, the more enticing and fun it becomes. It goes without saying that the visuals are sumptuous but the script/plot are fine as well too. Highly recommended.",8
"I am not one to review shows or any kind at all. But to be honest, I honestly do not think that people has given this show enough chances. While it may be unrealistic especially due to the diversity of the characters I do find it refreshing to have a show that is diverse.It's a fun, witty show that is NOT to be taken too seriously. With everything that has been going on in our reality this show definitely gets me out of it, even for just a moment. And that to me is enough to make this show a worthy to watch.",8
"I have to admit that there are differences from the book series, but I am ok with that. As any one how has watched a movie or series based off a book knows it is never the same. That being said I enjoy most of the changes that they have made. I think that they add to the story. I am looking forward to see what happens with the rest of the series.",8
"I enjoyed this series. Downton it isn't, but still watchable. Other reviewers have commented on casting but this is not historical fact - it is a STORY, a fiction that happens to be set in the early 19 th century. As such, characters can be whomever the author chooses. I'm looking forward to the next series.",9
"...to my review, I just wanted to add that I wish I had a wisteria that bloomed for as long as the one on the Bridgerton house ??",9
"It's the type of thing that you want to hope is a tongue in cheek parody, or a comedy, but it doesn't wink enough to let you know that it is, so the worry is it's a teen melodrama trying to take itself seriously.Not enough good bits from the book are in the show, nd some of the divergences fail to improve either.Don't mind a diverse cast in an unrealistic setting personally, but once that's done, by still keeping the pomp and circumstance, as well as the classism and sexism aspects all still in place makes it obviously jarring.The opportunity would have been to subvert all of that surely, once one of those fabrics was removed. Tell a new and different story more obviously tongue in cheek and more loosely based on the story.Is more similar to Reign (a dreadful, loosely historical teen drama but one that at least is self-knowing about that fact, and plays up to it), than other things that once they did one twist it could have been.Pride & Prejudice and Zombies, would have been a better inspiration, in how to set up the world building of non-accurate or loosely accurate history.",4
"I have completed 3 episodes and think this show is delightful. I came here to see the reviews and am completely gobsmacked to see how many people are twisted up about historical inaccuracy and reducing the great casting of this show as merely an attempt to be PC. I am fairly certain this is a fictional story line and the beauty of fiction is the freedoms that it can allow. How wonderful to see a genre I love so much set in a wonderful place where no one bats an eyelash at race. There is intrigue, chemistry, humor, and conflict all set in a beautiful place with magnificent costumes. It is escapism. It is pure entertainment. Shed your stuffy, dated expectations and exclusivity and take a breath of fresh air. I cannot wait to finish this!",10
"This series astonished me in every way and left me inspired, happy and full of emotions.
First of all to the diversity of the cast, because it is the first very obvious observation: It is not accurate of course, we all know that. But seeing another and better version of ""our history"" is a powerful thing, one that I felt and loved.
About the plot: It is basically ""gossip girl"" playing in the 19th century but with much less teenie drama and much more real emotions. The way the picture the sexuality of the characters is truly new to me and as much as a fresh breath of air as the diverse casting.
I haven't read the books and I know it can be hard for screen adaptions to live up to one's expectations. I can't comment on that. But without having read the books, this ist a truly new, strange and inspiring series with a great love story I would recommend to all my friends.",10
"Bridgeton is at the same time historically inaccurate, and accurate as my title shows, but only if you place it in our universe. It is a reimagined 19th century England, or should I say even better it is as an alternative history of our universe. Bridgeton represents what could have been if black and Asian people were part of high society. It is Shonda Rhimes production and you ought to expect good drama, great acting, great music, brightness from the get-go, the costumes, and smart writing. Some will say is woke and politically correct, and if I followed those reviews I wouldn't have watched this delight. It has woke elements but surprisingly is very subtle, not out there and in your face. If you pass through the historical inaccuracies you will realize how everything matches from the actors to the acting to the overall story.
Now what I meant by my title is this, it is historically inaccurate in the representation of minorities as part of high society, somewhat the liberties of some characters in public which would have never happened in Regency era, the portrayal of the queen as a dweller in narcotics, etc. But it is accurate in the shapes of the costumes with a fantasy feel of it, the way they talked the balls the events everything else. The creator of this show presents what our world could have looked if racism didn't exist if all women and men were equal and society see them based on their standing rather than their color. It's a perfect world but also there are some imperfections in this world that reflect ours. I don't wanna dwell in the story, but it is a must-watch once you pass through the historical inaccuracy and take this either as a reimagining of our world or simply the alternative universe to ours , and you will enjoy it and you will ask for more, I mean its Shonda Rhimes and Shonda doesn't create garbage. I am against everything that feels forced, with hidden agendas like most of the moves and tv shows these days but trusts me this is not that kind of show, this is a show that entertains you as all shows must be, it provides an escape from the real world if only for a moment and you will definitely enjoy it.",10
I really support the choice for a more diverse cast. Fiction is a door another worlds that mind can create.I,10
"I did not have the pleasure of meeting the related queen bee in words,
Although the series is not void of lovely sentences, with true literary value,on the contrary I very much appreciate the opportunity of hearing those words, thoughts, dialogue, and the mastery of the narrator.
Love scenes were ""normal"" , as I, usually, in many cases, facing abnormal fabricated behavior fast forward them... these passed as those real life has presented me, considering the epoch. So it is a positive experience of good takes, dialogues, art.
Stories as this are the fabric of a type of literature that transcends genres.
Beeing able to bring it to screen and take an old, experienced viewer and critic to its happy tears, falling slowly off his cheek, more than the sad little tears that real man also drop, was an unexpected pleasure.
Drama, adversity, naiveté, social constraints, love and pain, ilusion and delusion, what more to that stuff that dreams are made of?
I see clearly a good thing to say about Bridgeton,
Congratulations for bring us an object of that world called good cinema ou TV, in an age where we see the intersection of them both.
Congratulations for not spending my time with monetization and infantile attempts to shock and held the tent of a circus, as many unfortunate do.
Good ensemble.
Say different, I have my delusions filled already with some absurd criticism I was presented here in Imdb, here and there.
You are wrong. This is good work. Art.",5
"People trashing this show are just mad because it's not identical to the books... This show was actually good, the actors were phenomenal and I was captivated from beginning to end. Enjoy the Shonda magic... if you haven't read the books, read them... they are great but this show is good too. Surely I can't be the only one who understands the meaning of the word 'adaptation'? Surely people don't believe a series is going to be word for word as the books??",10
"Such an easy watch
The costumes are amazing
The acting is interesting in parts... Hastings is simply delightful",10
I watched the entire season in one day. hope season 2 will follow,9
Coming from a woman's point of view this show is very captivating to a little girl who is trying to find herself in a man's world. This show gives hope to us women whom are stuck in a life that we seem trapped. It is a brilliant well put together and I hope the director is ready to put out an amazing scandalous second season.,10
Amazin how It looks like reading the books! So much loved!,10
Daphne is cute but not the beauty she should be. She would not bring everything to a stop when she entered a room.,7
"Unbelievable plots, poorly written dialogue. A great disappointment.",1
"I have not read the book and knew nothing about it and I was not sure I would even like the series since I'm not really into romantic series/movies but I gave it a chance after seeing the trailer and from episode one I couldn't stop watching. I loved everything about it, the characters, the music, the clothing, the story. It made me both smile and cry at times. Eloise is my absolute favourite character. I can't wait for season 2.
I don't get the criticism about it not being historically accurate, for me it was just a story, in an alternative universe if you want. I once read a book with similar era describes but it was set in the future on another planet with aliens. Stories are stories. I'm not sure I would even like it if it was historically accurate. Watch it for what it is, a made up story. If you like romantic drama you will probably enjoy it.",8
"They attempt to show society as it would be if it were free of bias and encouraging female empowerment. It is an exercise to show that racial inclusion would not be offensive or lead to societal breakdown. With all the complaints, the experiment has failed for some. I personally enjoyed it immensely.",10
"I see a lot of complaints about the acting but I think they did the best they could with the material they were given. The story is predictable and the characters are shallow and saccharine. I'm halfway through and I'm really unable to care what happens to any of them.There's plenty besides the diversity to indicate this isn't trying to be a true period piece. You have people who've never met doing outrageous choreographed dancing, truly bizarre music for the period, and side characters who must dress and act ridiculous. Two guys beat the crap out of each other for five minutes without a scratch? OK...but whimsy can't make up for the insipid script.I give it a few stars because it isn't completely unwatchable, and probably fun for teenage girls.",3
"Beautiful set and costume design. I've not read the book(s) so my review doesn't carry that baggage. I like the diverse casting; no need to see Whitey McWhiteypants having all the fun. The feminist honking is a little over-the-top. Hard to listen to the 1%, male or female, whining so loudly. Worth watching, but have a phone on hand to distract during the cringe moments.",8
"I usually like these kind of period productions, but this was an awful mess. Just silly and not entertaining. I wanted to like it. But no.",2
"That was an enjoyable watch. Well acted, good storyline and undeniable chemistry between the Daphne and Simon. Bring on season 2!",9
"This show is great, from start to finish I was hooked, as was everyone else I know. There is a brilliant display of diversity and it is nice to see actors/actresses, many of them, at the beginning of their career. It has the brilliance of being adult enough to show the 'taboo' of regular period dramas, but does so in a way that allows romance and escapism. Sure people may say there is little historical correctness but the bigger picture is that it is a beautiful series. Does it have some flaws? Perhaps. Every brilliant show does. But I thought it to be amazing and I cannot wait to see Season 2.
Also one word... SIMON.",10
"I was interested at first, but I guess I just don't think there's any chemistry between the main two characters.... it started to get boring and ridiculous at the same time.... like the things standing in the way of happiness were so stupid and contrived.",7
Like watching a high school play. No historical accuracy horrific acting. What a waste of time,1
"I haven't enjoyed watching a show this much in YEARS. It has all of the ingredients of a great show: romantic, elegant, fun, sexy, great script and perfect casting, amazing music, luscious sets and costumes, beautiful, sweeping visuals. While Bridgerton is the first in its genre to veer sharply into steamy territory, it doesn't feel cheap thanks to talented actors and a strong plot. The use of modern songs performed by a string quartet is simply genius, and the music feels like a truly important component. There's an element of mystery with the identity of Lady Whistledown, which makes it great fun. I also admire what they did with the diverse cast. It's not meant to be historically accurate, but an imagined (and better) world. Cannot wait for season 2.",10
"So many colourful characters and scenery to take in. It comes across as less of a tv series and more of a theatre production, which is BRILLIANT. I also loved the subtle nods to fairy tale characters (think Cinderella, ugly step sisters). A visually beautiful show to watch, but the chemistry between Basset and Daphne is believable, and you really want them to succeed. Suspend any uppity notions of how a ""proper"" regency era drama should be done, and think more along the lines of the incredibly successful Broadway show, Hamilton. Have fun!",9
"Very captivating! I'm quite enjoying this series! Great acting, great story lines. Definitely worth watching!",10
"The prince gives Daphne an extravagant jeweled necklace, which she wears to the ball where the prince is expected to propose (episode 4?). Before he can pop the question, Daphne runs outside. She rips off the necklace and places it on the garden wall.A new scandal? Someone finds the necklace and reports back to the queen? Blackmails Daphne to get it back? Absconds with it and Daphne is desperate to find it to return it to her rejected suitor? Nope. None of the above. It just disappears and is never mentioned again.",8
"Oh dear so many awful reviews. I wondered if i had moved into the twighlight zone.This is set in Regency times. King George III who now historians believe may have been suffering with Porphria. A bored queen Charlotte who filled her sad days with games manipulating her royal subjects. It wasnt until part way in I realised she was being played by a black actress. I thought she was amazing actually her face said it all. She obviously loved her husband but had no idea how to deal with his madness and everytime she could she should visit him in more lucid moments. It must have been quite hard for her to deal with.Then she meets the beautiful and flawless Daphne Bridgerton. It was then I was slowly introduced to the family. Daphne an innocent who was meeting the Queen on her coming out. With comments of the queen one would expect Daphne to have a queue of suitors, well she did sort of but sadly her over proective brother ruined that for her.The story is slow unfolding we get to meet all the main characters, and their stories enrwine within the story. We get to meet the family the Bridgertons i loved the mother, and Eloise too, and the eldester brother who was lost as he just had no idea how to run a family and was besotted with an opera singer. Benedict Bridgerton bored of society who slipped quietly into the unknown world of gay, and orgies and arists. Colin a quiet young man kind.then we met The Duke and i fell in love lol. We learnt of his terrible childhood, so bad it turned him away from love and family. His fathers cruelty he was only saved by the lovely but fierce Lady Danbury who i fell in love with such a wonderful character..I just loved the series never read the books. Its truly and epic love story. Whats all this WOKE business? I never noticed the characters ethnicity. If people dont think there were a mix race going on in Regency times well they need to get their heads out of he sand. The morality in that time was pretty non existant. Anythinig went, and Shonda Rimes used the right mix of it for me.I have recommended this to many of my friends who have now binged it and all LOVED IT. we cant wait for Season 2.Its full of intrigue, incest, homosexuality, you name it well its in there.As to queen charlotte several historians have said Charlotte was directly descended from a Black branch of the Portuguese royal family: Alfonso III and his concubine, Ouruana, a Black Moor.WATCH ENJOY.",10
"This will not appeal to the average viewer of historical drama. This series is playing with culture and our assumptions about culture rather than portraying an accurate historical version of the time.The acting was fine, especially much of the supporting cast; the story a bit predictable; and while some of the script was nicely written, in other parts it was cringe-worthy.***Minor spoilers ahead.
I'm a fan of alternative history stories--they make me think, and question my assumptions. (I'm speaking of the Queen, wife to King George, being a PoC and the the possibilities this opens up for other PoCs.) Not that this was the focus of the story; it formed the background, and was mostly taken for granted rather than discussed. Other anachronisms included women being assertive, lots of modern-style swearing, and modern-Hollywood-style sex (both in quality and quantity).",7
"Beautiful costumes, setting and story. No, I haven't read the book. The review is about the show. If you enjoy time period pieces with a twist and romance, you'll love this show. Just watch it!!",9
This was definitely a show you could binge in one day and enjoy every moment of it!,10
"Took me 15 minutes to conclude it was not a comedy, not to say it that I found it funny but it seemed so over the top that there was no way it was to be taken seriously. Well, it seems I was wrong. The acting seems relatively solid as is the costumes and the cinematography, unfortunately it does not work at all.",5
"For the first half of episode 1, I was trying to figure out the diversity in casting of the Queen, Duke of Hastings and rest of the cast. However by the end of episode 1 I was hooked and had fallen in love with the story and acting. Quite different than the books, Bridgerton, the Neflix series has more influences of today - contemporary songs remade with orchestra pieces - that help set the tone and the mood of the story.
This is a smart and updated version of Bridgerton with lead characters who carry it off quite elegantly.
I am already waiting for season 2. I will admit I watched three episodes in a row and then picked it back up later in the day as soon as I had a chance.
If I would suggest anything it would be I that the show should have given the explanation of why the diverse cast works in the ""Bridgerton World"" from the beginning in the first episode instead of explaining it in later episodes.",8
"Honestly, it's not that bad after a few glasses of wine. I enjoyed watching a period piece with a racially diverse cast. However, if you're going to get rid of racism why not also get rid of misogyny, bigotry, and classism?",3
"I finished the show in one day. I saw it with my sister, we both liked the idea of the 1800s, I mean, who wouldn't want to live in those years? The Duke is simply so mysterious, which makes the show even better, because the more minutes you see from the show, the more you learn about him and his past. You have to see this show, it's one of my favorites and I'm sure you'll like it too!!!!!",10
"As a viewer who didn't read the books I binged the show in one day. I enjoyed the characters, costumes and locations. Honestly a show doesn't have to be historically/racially correct to be entertaining. Watch it, it's good.",10
It's the worst 19th century tv show. The show have nothing to do with how they talk and live in that century. I have read and watched a lot books and moves and tv show about that century and they have nothing do to with Bridgerton. It's a waist of time. I watch a the episodes only because I want to have a complete opinion and to find out what happen in the end.,1
"I'm not really a big fan of period dramas, but I'm in love with the show!",9
It was entertaining. If you're looking for an epic historically accurate piece then this isn't it and it doesn't pretend to be. It's just a modern love story with a Victorian era backdrop. It succeeds at being that. I think the leads did well and had solid chemistry although surprisingly the best couple to me was Anthony and Sienna. I enjoyed their scenes most of all. Everything between them was so intense. Their passion overshadowed the leads a bit for me. Those actors really delivered,7
I've seen numerous book adaptations over the years and none have been so well done as Bridgerton. It follows Julia Quinn's books so closely while also adding some changes that seamlessly fit with the story. The cast is impeccable and the flow of events is perfect; not a moment of boredom. I look forward to many more seasons as we get to see the stories of each of the siblings.,10
"I cannot believe some of the reviews I read ??
Especially the ones who says that it's not equally with the book. So what!!!!!
I just loved the whole show , the dresses , the houses , everything is over the top and I loved it all. I really hope the second part is coming very soon",10
"Best love story, only got 1 more episode to watch, I'm totally in Love with it. Hope they making a second & more.
The only criticism I have is the ONE reference to racism, so far, It didn't need it. It just took you back to today's horrendous world. But apart from that it's a beautiful story. If only we could all live in a world like that.",10
"Gossip Girl set in Regency England. Might be your thing or it might not. Personally I loved it. Just don't expect anything close to Austen- this is not in the least bit historically accurate but it's great fun if you appreciate it for what it is, gloriously trashy escapism.",9
It's awful. I felt no emotional connection to the characters. Netflix adaptations are soo bad,1
"This is not your mother's period drama piece.
This is so much more.Yes, the costumes are not historically accurate. Did that take away from the show? Maybe for you, but in the vein of Coppola's Marie Antoinette, it very much displayed the lavishness and possibility that period clothing could be more. The costume design team has made a masterpiece, it was a genuine pleasure to see such intricate and breathtaking pieces shown. From the Queen's court dress to Daphne's blue morning dress - they are beautiful, simply put.Yes, there are black aristocrats (aside from the main hero, portrayed by Regé-Jean Page) which is not entirely historically accurate. Does this change the character? His motivations? No, he's still Simon. Does the fact that there are black aristocrats get addressed? Yes, in a very moving speech from the (mind-blowingly perfect portrayal) of Lady Danbury (Adjoa Andoh).Yes, it's not family-friendly, in the traditional sense of the ratings system. Does this take away from the perfectly executed family scenes between the Bridgerton siblings? No, it does not. To quote Lady Violet Bridgerton (Ruth Gemmell) ""We like each other"", and that is something that is integral from the books and is now in the show.As someone who has watched many period pieces and suffered through the uncomfortable Mansfield Park (1999), these actors and actresses are worlds apart. It's fresh and dramatic and exactly what I would expect from the combined talents of Julia Quinn, Shanda Rimes, and Chris Van Dusen.While I'm just another fan, and one who has watched Pride and Prejudice (2005) one too many times, I can confidently say that this is my favorite period drama. Is it because it's newly released? Dramatic? A visual joy? No, because many other period pieces I could say the same for.It's because in every aspect of the show they have modernized the story, but in subtle ways that do not over-power the larger scope of the show. The excellent cinematography and set design, diversity in casting, scripting in a way that isn't right out of Austen, and the score. I could wax poetic and write another 400 words on the score and audio alone. Kris Bowers: you are so very talented and as my best friend as my witness, I had to pause and go on a ten minute excited rant about the track (that I now know and have downloaded) ""Simon and Lady Danbury"".At the end of the day, don't take my word for it. Form your own opinion. If it's not your cup of tea, then go get a juice box.",10
"I think the intensity of the negative reviews comes from viewers who had read the book. As is typical for book loyalists, regardless of which adaptation, they are simply incapable of a fair review. IMO.
Likewise, Pride and Prejudice/Downton Abbey fans are going to be hard on this show. This series was never meant to be historically accurate. It was meant to be hyperbole.
I'm a big fan of Baz Luhrmann's style, and this reminded me so much of his movies. It's a cross between his Romeo and Juliet, or Moulin Rouge, and perhaps Sofia Coppola's Marie Antionette.
Simon is perfectly cast, and his intensity and commanding presence set the bar high for the rest. Eloise is a close second. She almost steals the show.
Ignore the naysayers, and give it a chance!",9
"And that's for the gorgeous costumes. The series' writing is so bad it could be entered into a ""Write an awful parody in the style of Jane Austen.""",4
Excellent period drama with wonderdully written intertwined stories. Watched it all in 2 days as it was utterly captivating!,10
"Apart from the ""woke"" lenses through which this series is made, and which I have simply ignored, there is a certain unity of style that keeps one glued to the screen. Taken as a fairy tale for adults, it is most enjoyable, at least as long as you don't really take it seriously. Very witty dialogues, superb costumes and very sexy actors and actresses of all sexes, races and life-styles, if you pardon my French!",8
"Bridgerton is a mediocre rendition of the domestic novels that established the likes of Jane Austen to the helm of fictional writing in the late 18th and 19th century. Women's obsession with marriage - marrying into a financially sound family - marks the primary theme of Bridgerton. Obviously the agencies available to women in the period were rare and a good marriage (sadly!) was what they considered as a secure retreat from the brutalities if the world. Bridgerton picks up this theme but fails to establish a connection with the viewers as the characters are largely mechanical and hammy too in parts. Their emotions are hardly palpable and some parts are so uncharacteristic of the era it's set in. The protagonist, Daphne Bridgerton, is no Elizabeth Bennett or Elinor Dashwood or Emma Woodhouse. She is one note and without actually caring for her the smooth/breezy screenplay just permits us to flow with her. You do not feel her awe or her joy or her troubles as you feel deeply how Elizabeth is in a dilemma - joy and shock - during her visit to Mr. Darcy's family estate, Pemberley.What salvages the show is that the narrative never bores. There's enough colour and celebrations and light hearted romance to keep you engaged through the running time. The show looks beautiful but we have seen better in ""Downtown Abbey"". The costumes though are at times just too eye popping instead of being eye pleasing. And who gave them the idea of playing ""Girls like you"" in the background for a show set in 1813 - it's such a put off.You may give it a try and flow with the tide but don't expect anything concrete. It's entertaining but fragile with emotions.",5
This is more stupid than the stupidest stupid or even stupider.,1
A historical fiction relying HEAVILY on the fiction.,1
"Very good work this is a very good ,overall a good movie and we all like it",10
"I've been up late for hours binge watching this show but I have to stop at episode 7 and have some sleep.
I love the characters and the diversity. If only life was really as accepting of everyone as it is in this show. At first I was confused and thought this is not how it was back then, it's hardly like it now sadly, but then I didn't care that it wasn't following with accuracy. I just loved the characters and their stories. Characters I thought I wouldn't like I do and characters I thought I would like I think are terrible self serving people.
I don't know the books, have never heard of it before so I went in with no expectations and so probably no disappointments. I would recommend this but I guess if you love the books you are probably going to be disappointed from what I've read from others.",8
"1. I'm not interesting in idle gossip and backstabbing and this is HOUR upon HOUR of it.
2. The sex scenes are so cheesy and overdone and sometimes take up the entire episode.
I tried to watch but episode 7 was enough.
3. This show doesn't empower women. It shows them mostly as nothing but liars but also attacking one another, gossiping about one another, using sex as revenge ?! Doesn't seem very empowering or 2020.",3
"This show is not only wildly inaccurate in its period depictions but also incredibly pretentious, distastefully raunchy and just all around trash entertainment.",2
"It can hook you immediately, everything seems fitting , the setting , the acting , the direction. Just as it should be. Bringing out the perfect blend of 1980s nostalgia. It gives mixture of taste of big 80's movies.You immediately get hooked with the story , which is amazing because it takes time for me to get invested in a story.I have been a fan of David Harbour Since the Newsroom , and he is just amazing.You're scared , Intrigued , you're completely invested. With perfect setting.I am really looking forward to where this goes from here on in.",10
"With its amazing 80s atmosphere and creepy X-files meets E.T feel this show is set to impress. Within its first 8 minutes of run time I could tell I had found something special here in Stranger Things.Its intriguing story gives information at a great pace and I never felt myself getting confused of bored and there were enough twists or turns to keep me interested. This also had some rather great horror sequences and their use of lights flickering while yes a common trope fit so well in to the story I was on the edge of my seat every time the crackle of electricity shot through my speakers and the lights flickered.The characters of the show are the true stars here, I loved every single one of them. They were all great with amazingly interesting flaws and the way they mix and clash with one another was fun to see unfold. They certainly help to carry this show although I would say that the government antagonists of the show felt a little flat and under developed and not nearly as memorable.Production values are also quite good with some beautiful cinematography, editing, lighting and sound. My goodness I loved their music choices. I would say that the CGI does look a little obvious and from time to time I did notice some issues where the scenes didn't look quite up to scratch. I do think however I've been spoiled for visual quality since Game of Thrones so I would take that criticism with a grain of salt because it certainly didn't detract from the overall experience. The setting and style of everything in the locations where also great to see and felt real and interesting. The way everything was shot also captures every moment expertly and really helps to draw out those story moments with greater emotion.Stranger Things is one of those special shows that I stumbled across and after the opening I knew I was hooked. Its exciting dark tale is expertly woven through its 8 episode run time and I know I will be back to re-watch this one. The ending is fairly well rapped up with a few loose story threads left hanging, with a promise for potential follow on seasons but the story is quite satisfyingly rapped up by the end. Memorable, exciting, dark and haunting Netflix knocks Stranger Things out of the park, 10/10.",9
"Netflix does it again! I'll admit, I was excited for this show just based on the genre it was listed as being in and so far it has not disappointed. With the exception of a few of the adults most of the cast was unknown to me which only adds to the level of immersion the show can reach. The two performers I was familiar with, Winona Ryder and David Harbour are both magnificent. A few things about Stranger Things are extraordinary and could only be done by Netflix. One, this show is suspenseful and engaging so waiting for a week to see the next episode would change the entire dynamic and would really be a bummer, Stranger Things must be binged! Second, the creators of this series are, like the young actors, unknown to me. Matt and Ross Duffer. Brothers that through conventional methods may not have had the opportunity to bring this show to life, get that opportunity from Netflix. In the past few years television has changed wildly. If you were a writer or actor five years ago you would much rather be a movie star than a television star, those distinctions have all but vanished. This change was brought on by many factors but I'd like to take this opportunity to applaud Netflix for their role. It is no coincidence that they started doing their own programming right around the same time these changes began. Bravo and please start filming season two of Stranger Things ASAP!",10
"Right from the beginning it's obviously set in the 80s. My first thought was E.T. for some reason. Aliens also came to mind. I have yet to continue the season but so far, it's a good choice if you're an 80s retro fan. I gave a 6/10 but that may change. The other episodes will determine my rate changes. Winona Ryder so far is likable as a mother. There were some strange things happening alright. I guess by continuing you'll come across stranger things. Law enforcement is introduced with their typical Monday morning mood. The Chief of police is introduced as a conceited figure of authority, an attitude I'm sure many have seen in resemblance to other films or programs set in the same era. It should make for an interesting plot.",6
"Just finished binge watching the entire first season. Not a bad show and entertaining enough.Chuck Carrie, Poltergeist, Stand by me, The Goonies, E.T. and a touch of Resident Evil into a blender and you end up with something like this show.They done a great job in creating a show that feels like a genuine 80's blockbuster including Synthesiser Score and all.The acting and script are great and you will actually care about the characters.The first 4 episodes are a little slow but never boring.Not much re-watch value but an entertaining show none the less.",8
"What can I say Netflix has done it again!I was hooked from the first episode!The acting in this is brilliant, especially from the younger members of the cast.The period it is set in they have managed to get it spot on down to the littlest details.I especially like the musical score in it, sets the mood superbly!This series has the perfect amount of mystery, suspense, and scares to keep you wanting more!! Hope this show runs for many more episodes, it's a classic in my eyes!",9
"Firstly, I feel I need to give you a disclaimer and tell you that I'm a big fan of most of Spielberg movies, so I could be biased. JJ Abrams' Super8 didn't blow me away and this definitely has the same DNA, and this is really good. The story, the soundtrack to the amazing child actors, all so good, especially Millie Bobby Brown who is incredible as Eleven. I must be hooked because I watched all the episodes in one go and I've got to go to work early tomorrow. All actors involved put in genre perfect performances, and it was nice seeing Winona Ryder in a major acting role again, although I think of Heathers whenever she's on screen, but that's just me. The only downside, if I had to choose one, is the monster effects aren't blockbuster movie quality, Hopefully, they'll be better in season 2 and it can't come soon enough. All credit to Netflix, they really seem to know what they're doing.",8
"Stranger Things is the newest foray into Netflix's original programming, of which brings us their most impressive- and strange- production to date. When a young boy named Will Byers goes missing, his friends, mother and the town are thrust into a conspiracy involving a mysterious girl named Eleven and something even more sinister hiding in the woods of Hawkins, Indiana.From the get-go, you can tell this is an homage to classic '80s Spielberg, drawing on E.T. and Close Encounters, as well as JJ Abrams' Super 8. But, as the show progresses, it becomes more and more like a twisted Stephen King story set in a Spielberg movie. It becomes a dark and twisted ride into an even darker and more disturbing world where the stakes feel higher than anything before it.I can't go into great detail because spoiling even just a bit of the story takes away from the greater mystery, but I can say, it's one of the most thrilling and intense series to be on TV, without being on TV. If it were to continue, they have to pull the same punches they did with the first season, because they took a great many clichés, and somehow made them fresh and surprising, save for just a couple that they purposefully left cliché.",10
"I've been trying to put my reaction to this series into cohesive sentences - even cohesive thoughts - and I just can't seem to do it. ""Stranger Things"" blended the best parts of some of the great 80's sci-fi films from ""E.T."" to ""Poltergeist"" to ""The Goonies"" to my all time favorite, ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind."" It was simply brilliant, and brings you back to a time when you were still able to feel a sense of wonder.Though there are plenty of thrilling moments, this film does not rely on heavy CGI or jump-scares. It focuses on relationships between parents and children, best friends, and even a touch of romance. It takes you on a journey from a parent's worst nightmare to the resilience of those who rely on friends and cling to hope.Also - you'll never look at Christmas lights the same way again.",8
"It is a loving homage to everything great about eighties movies, but done in subtly enough way as to not be off putting. There are smart kids, young love, bike chases, flickering lights, 'suits,' and amazing creature work. Is there really much more that you could ask for?There are converging story lines, flawed yet relatable characters, and so much more.This show held up better than I ever could have expected.I have so much more I could say but this is a circumstance where going in blind will make your experience that much better, so I'll hold my tongue.Don't read any reviews, don't watch any trailers, just go watch it. The first eight minutes will win you over.",10
"Wow what a unexpected blast this series is. Im steel stunned and wandering what a heck did i just watched?! Acting, camera, music, drama, mystery everything right on the spot. This series is a real jewel i want go into spoilers and all im gonna say is you gotta watch this. Of course we have seen things like this before but not in this unique and original way. 80s settings is done perfect. I was thinking at first this is some kids goonies like series but boy i was wrong. What should i say more than judging from the first episode looks like i have new favorite. I keep my fingers crossed and hope other episodes want spoil perfect atmosphere and settings. Im just wandering who has given this series less than 10. What would you expect more? Just Be sure you don't let your kids watch this ;)",10
"An amazing nostalgia driven story, but also mysteriously thought provoking and scary. Stranger Things gives us a mash up of several cult hits like, The Goonies, IT, and ET. The show always seems to end an episode by sinking its claws a little deeper each time and really has you caring for these characters by the end.IE(Hop). Winona Ryder returns in great form and delivers a great performance. Her range of emotions of a grief stricken and angry mother shines through. David Harbour also shines as his character, but I think the real shining performance was those of the four main kids, who are all great and feel genuinely real of time period.(80's) Great fun and well recommended. Netflix keeps knocking it out the park with great intriguing stories.",9
"Now I am only into the second episode, and just can't see why this has a rating of 9.3. But I do get that things may still pick up and blow me away like the high ratings it has! Although I doubt it, sure it reminds me of films and series from the past, but take those facts away and you are left with kids TV, with a few cheap thrills mixed in.Now I am sure my review up to episode 2 will receive many thumbs down, but if you are an adult and measure films and series from the past against the high score of 9.3 of this so far, you can't be serious.It is a kids show, nothing more, and borrows a story line from lots of other previous films and series, and that's it so far, and just can't see why it has this high score.I will give this a 5, and will change it after another episode or 2, that's if I can last that long.5 out of 10 at episode 2.I have made it to the end of the 3rd episode, but that's it, it is just way to boring for my liking, and looks like it just borrows bits from films and series from the past. I will put this into some realistic perspective, as it sits now it has a rating sitting at that very questionable score of 9.3, let me just remind people that vote for this, the number 1 and number 2 spot of highest rated films on IMDb ever, both have a rating of 9.2! How can dribble TV like this be rated so high? Either the world has gone mad, or the ratings on here are just bogus.Now don't get me wrong, I have seen far worse than this show, but have seen far better as well, it is glossy to look at, but it seems to be purely made for teenagers. And comparing it to classics from the past as in films and series is an insult, plain and simple.I can only give this a 1 out of 10, and please keep voting my review down, as it only proves how bad this really is.",1
"Enjoyable is how I would describe this. Really loved the premise, the actors, and how well-made and polished this looks. Binge-watched it in a day. This is one of those things that you cannot let go once you have started watching, and even when the 8 episodes(totaling almost to 8 hours)do end, you wish it could be longer. I am already looking forward to the next season(Please Netflix, say you are too!)! So, all those sci-fi crazed fans like me, go ahead and watch this. There is an overall shroud of mystery that fits the story-line. The town of Hawkins, with its rain-drenched roads, and dark forests, is tailor-made to host the finale which will leave you wanting for more! Happy binging folks!",9
"ATTENTION TO ALL OF YOU WHO LIVED YOU'RE YOUTH IN YEARS 80, liked movies like Goonies, Portergeist, The Evil Dead, The Thing, Alien(s), Star Wars, ET, Clouse Encounters of the Third Degree, Indiana Jones, It - Stephen King, Lord of the Rings (ok, this is newer, but the books are older and the references are all there) and so many other fantastic and unbeatable classics of that magic decade. I have to say: Watch THIS, STRANGER THINGS! Oh really. Watch it. But watch accordingly: at night, turn off your mobile, whats-app, Facebook, Instagram, blah blah blah, watch as you should watch every movie, with immersion, transport yourself into the adventure, and I assure you, you will remember how it used to be, when going to the movies itself was already an adventure. You will be transported to the 80's. Cool characters, family dramas, pure and sincere friendships among nerd, intelligent, and excluded children, teenage's dramas, music and soundtrack of the 80s, in every detail, from the suspense in songs of each scene, the opening song and title of the series, the soundtrack, the references/homage to the 80's is very strong, very clear. I loved it. For me, it is among the 2 best series I've seen in the last 10 years, with only Game of Thrones at the same level. I cannot think of any other that has given me so much pleasure to watch, which has given me the desire to watch again, and again, and again. No, not even Breaking Bad, Marvel's Daredevil, The Walking Dead, The Expanse (unknown by many, but i liked), NCIS, etc. I'm looking here at the list of series that I follow (around 50), and none is equal to the entertainment provided by this. Congratulations to the Duffer brothers. The series is amazing. Worth every minute.",10
"Nicely paced show. The build up is a bit of a slow burn with great character development and an excellent cast. This is refreshing in that this series does not try to scare you every five minutes like a lot of things out now. The show, instead, exudes a subtle dark undercurrent dread and things unseen.If you were a kid in the 80's you will appreciate the choice of music, the clash and joy division tracks just seem to fit so well. Stranger Things gives off a Stephen King/Spielberg vibe from the get-go and is a love letter to the 80's. I'm not sure it breaks any new ground, but what it does, it does very well. The only thing I did not care for is that the ""bad guys"" are a bit one dimensional. The rest of the cast more than makes up for this shortcoming. Winona Ryder is great, the cast of kids, top notch. Netflix continues to crank out quality stuff.",8
"Yes it's OK. Very dull until episode 4 when the story actually begins to become a little less predictable. The story is a blend of poltergeist meets underworld meets the goonies. Beautiful attention to details of the period but one can't help feel this attention has come at the expense of a consistent storyline. 011 is an excellent actress and deserves a huge amount of praise. We stuck with it until the end and it was enjoyable and I'm glad I watched it. However, it's once watched you probably wouldn't bother again. Its chewing gum for the eyes and sitting through it again would be akin to popping yesterday's gum back in. Still chewy enough to work your jaw but without any flavour.",5
"Although it starts quite nice, it gets more awful by the minute. The dialogues appear as if spoken by the Teletubbies, everything is repeated at least twice. Winona Ryder (who used to be wonderful!) acts like a 70 year old lunatic witch with weird gestures and wide eyes, even the rest of the cast is screaming and yelling most of the time. The 3 main kids act completely over the top, including all those movements and slang kids use TODAY, but didn't in the 80s! The Natalia Dyer story line (please give her something to eat! She looks as if she is falling apart any time!) is schmaltzy beyond compare, and contains by far the stupidest acting. What is worst, there is probably not one original thought in the whole series, it is just one big mashup from Poltergeist to E.T., the Goonies, Indiana Jones' sidekick Short Round, even Minority Report. You name any other 80s' flick, it's there. But - and this is a huge big BUT - Millie Bobby Brown (Eleven) is absolutely amazing! Every gesture, every shy gaze rips your heart into pieces. She definitely deserves much better than this crap series.",1
"I wasn't sure what to expect from Stranger Things because I don't really know anything about the source material. I've watched a few episodes (I'm trying to pace myself) but I can confidently say that I'm hooked, I've got to have more Stranger Things. These characters are wonderful and engrossing. Winona Ryder & David Harbour really do such a good job in this and I know working with very young actors must be challenging but these kids really bring it! I especially like how normal these characters look even though they are engrossed in such a surreal situation. This is what real sci-fi should be about. Netflix, I keep trying to find a reason to end my subscription with you but I just can't find a single one (smile!).",10
"Imagine if the atmosphere of Twin Peaks had a child with Super 8's mystique and gave birth to Silent Hill's eerie quality with a hint of X-files's flavor - that's Stranger Things for you.There are so many things about it that are very unlike what you see on TV, due to more freedom given by Netflix. It's refreshing. It's suspenseful. It leaves you feeling like you're actually THERE and you're feeling EVERYTHING. It's really hard to describe. All I can say is that you really feel like you go into a whole new world when you watch this. Even though it has kids in it, I wouldn't call it a kids show at all and wouldn't recommend you let your younger children watch it, as it may disturb them. It's not particularly gory, but it's a psychological twister.If you like a good mystery with a dash of supernatural, you'll like this.",10
"Breathtaking. Watched it in one sitting. It really feels like it would be originating in the 80's. Great Costume, Set Design, Soundtrack, Artwork, directing, photography and so on. When i watch movies out of the period the Show is set in, I always think how sad it is, that movies or TV shows aren't made like that anymore. So it was a real pleasure to see with how much love for detail the team reconstructed, not just the look but the whole feeling of an 80's movie. The child actors are great and, if they won't end up with a drug addiction, will have a great career. The last episode was basically an hour of crying. Netflix one again, shows how high the quality of their own productions is and how important they have become as one of the big players. Its definitely one of my favorite newcomers this year and I'm looking forward to the next season.",10
"Just watched the first chapter last night. Everything about it is great, the actors, the writing, the fact that it takes place in the FREAKING 80s (YES!) and all the music. The theme music is completely on point...very John Carpenter-ish with heavy synthesizer sounds that are very menacing. Watch this show, tell your friends to watch. It feels very Stephen King/Steven Spielberg..with some X-Files mixed in. I have never seen the kid actors before but they were all so good. Their on screen chemistry reminded me of the group of friends from The Explorers, Stand By Me or The Goonies but it's definitely not lighthearted or a comedy at all. It's always a good sign that a show is going to be good when you are completely sucked in within the first couple minutes. 10 out of 10 so far.?",10
Hi guys and gals!This series is the best in the genre (series/mystery) in a long time.And who delivers again...? You already know: Netflix. They hardly every miss on their exclusive content.The Duffer brothers made it big this time. I liked them from Wayward Pines excellent scripts.The casting is great!This series will be appreciated in by most from 10-88yo.For those like me who grew up in the 80s this series have a nostalgic vibe also. I won't spoil and don't go into details.I hope you enjoy it as much as i did!Have a great time in front of the screen of choice!Till next time!,9
"Stranger Things is another very good offering from Netflix.. it certainly holds its own with the best in the horror genre on TV.. a stronger area than some would have us believe.. Walking Dead, American Horror, Penny Dreadful, Outcast.. strong performers all. As someone who grew up in the 80s the cultural references in this are off the charts.. you can see what they watched and read for inspiration, It, the Langoliers, ET... even Predator.. apart from some fairly obvious reasons heres a great one for fans of the Arnie classic... Jim Hopper saves Hawkins from the monster... My one minor complaint is that at a couple of points the cgi/green screen is a bit dodgy. The make up, sets, acting, direction and writing make up for it though and most of the visual FX are decent.. It is left for a season 2 if there will be one, but not to worry it's not left on a cliffhanger which is always a relief. All in all another great one for a binge session.",9
"Super disappointed. Target audience has to be 8-14 years old. SO many things are unexplained that need to be explained. Huge plot holes and characters doing things that make absolutely no sense... constantly. What is even worse is that it is often the adult characters who do the stupidest things. Only a young audience could ignore it. Every time there is an intense scene of suspense the screen writer does something dumb to make you say ""Wtf?"" I will just say it... This TV series is really really stupid. There are also some adult centered themes that feel so out of place because most of the story is shown through 4 kids. Adult redemption and revelation themes are silly when 80% of the scenes are either 4 childhood friends or a high school couple. Add in some very shitty CGI to go with it and I am done.",7
"The movie is really a mixture of clichés and ""borrowings"" from other series and movies, but somehow it's still enjoyable. I think, mostly due to the great cast and solid acting from the young actors. Visually, the shadows world is a blatant copy of the shadows world from Russian ""Night Watch"" movies. Some scenes have definite Spielberg movies inspiration. Throughout the series you will be like ""oh, I 've seen this already"" but you will, probably, continue to watch because who doesn't love well made old good sci-fi and, also, when the ""plump"" kid Dustin steals the show while on screen, your heart melts. All kids did great really. Winona's role was just too whiny and poorly developed for my liking. In ""youth"" category I really liked Joe Kerry. Though the main villain in the movie is the ""government agency"", I still think Dr Martin character was too sketchy and I did not quite catch what exactly those experiments were about.",7
a kid with telepathy and telekinesis powers has a bleeding nose every time after she uses her power. checka science teacher / scientist explains how to bend space and time using a paper and a pen and pushing the pen through the paper. checkparallel universes. checkdolphin like sounds making alien monsters. checkguy tries to shoot cans with a gun but fails then an unexpected woman with amazing marksman skills comes and shoots the targets. so cool! check.And everything else is so cliché about this show. And IMDb you are a huge liar because of your fake ratings.This pile of nonsense doesn't deserve anything more than a 6. But then again who would watch it if you had shown such a rating next to it right? You are in this for the money after all. This was the last time I use IMDb to decide whether something is worth watching or not.,6
"At first I saw a lot of Spielburg in Stranger Things, then once I got a few episodes in I realized that it's actually inspired mostly by Stephen King stories. Stranger Things = Stephen King (get it?). The biggest contributors I've noticed are Stand By Me, Dead Zone, Creepshow and Firestarter.It's very well done, the visuals are great, the acting is good and the pace is brisk enough that it should keep most people interested. It does help if you're familiar with 80's thrillers because nostalgia is one of Stranger Thing's strengths.It's definitely weird, which is expected. I definitely see this show becoming a quick cult favorite.",9
"I found the series very predictable. But, what was unpredictable was how good it felt, because the plot treatment was mesmerizing. The cinematography was playing mind games with the viewer and the editing completely helped to be involved in the show. The kids were believable and reminded us of why childhood was so important. The show made me feel like another character in the plot. All actors were just bada$$. The music was the favourite thing for me. Special mentions to the 2 newcomers. Great job! Netflix is on a roll and Shawn Levy, great project.Some pointers though: expecting better CGI next time. Winona was used lesser than I thought. She needed more screen time.",10
"(I didn't include a synopsis because they're everywhere)When I first saw the trailer for this show a few weeks back, I immediately thought of R.L Stine and Stephen King. But also for some god forsaken reason I thought of Earth to Echo, so I was very conflicted on what my prior thoughts were. Without a doubt I came into this show very skeptical. As soon as I watched the first 10 minutes of episode 1, I knew I was in for a treat.The first thing that struck me as I was watching it was the direction. Straight from the get go, I felt as if I was watching a movie. From the amazing cinematography to the incredible set pieces, I honestly forgot I was watching a show until the hard cut to credits.The characters were something I was always on the fence with. I kept going back and fourth from saying ""Yeah man, good for you!"" and ""What the hell is wrong with you?"". It took me up until the third episode to really get conformable with the main cast and crew, but once I hit that point I began to adore all of them. Surprisingly my favorite character by the end was Nancy, the uptight older sister of Michael.The story is so genuine and so unique there is almost nothing I would change. Except one thing, the main antagonist. They never fully disclose their driving force to do what they do, and what their ultimate goal is. However that's not a huge issue, and hopefully they'll go more into it in season 2.Stranger Things was more than just a new show to binge on Netflix, it was an experience. I don't want that to sound like an excuse to watch it. This show was truly a great piece of art in the cinematography medium. I highly recommend this show to anyone who wants to be surprised.",9
"Netflix delivers another amazing original series with Stranger Things. The show mixes science fiction, horror, adventure, mystery, and teenage romance while throwing in lighthearted comedy and a deeper emotional core. It hearkens back to the Spielberg films with an optimistic undertone and a small town 1980s setting. I enjoyed every episode and the momentum rises all the way to the last shot of the first season. I sincerely hope this show returns for another round.This Netflix series is just great, fun, entertaining, stunning special-effects, and a plot that will blow viewers away. The acting is wonderful and brings to life characters that are easy to root for. Plenty of laughs to be had throughout and each episode ends with a cliffhanger that makes this show incredibly bingeable.The show has plenty of intense scenes of horror and utilizes every moment of the eight episodes to push the story along. The Duffer Brothers have delivered a gem capitalizing on nostalgia and delivering a fun, yet complex plot. Anyone with a Netflix subscription should check this show out and I'll be shocked if you don't enjoy it.After season 2: Netflix's 80s tribute and sci-fi adventure returns with another great season of monsters, twists, and a charismatic cast. The film begins with a bizarre scene where a group of punks flee including Kali (Linnea Berthelsen) who shares a similar tattoo to Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown). Mike Wheeler (Finn Wolfhard) continues to reach out to Eleven over the radio but he never hears anything. Eleven is hiding out in a cabin with Jim Hopper (David Harbour), kept isolated from nearby Hawkins. Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) and Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin) are obsessed over a mysterious MadMax who continues to beat their high scores. Will Byers (Noah Schnapp) has some residual effects of staying in the upside down for so long and will warp into the other dimension to see a giant monster approaching. His mother Joyce (Winona Ryder) worries for her son and has started a new relationship with Bob (Sean Astin), a technology expert.Mike's older sister Nancy (Natalia Dyer) continues to try to learn more about her missing friend Barb, enlisting of Will's older brother Jonathan Byers (Charlie Heaton) much to the detriment of her relationship with Steve Harrington (Joe Keery). The new characters in town are Maxine (Sadie Sink) aka Max who has been beating Dustin's high scores and her bully of a stepbrother Billy (Dacre Montgomery). As the monster slowly creeps towards Will, stranger things happen around Hawkins even as Chief Hopper makes an arrangement with the Department of Energy's new project leader Dr. Sam Owens (Paul Reiser). Pumpkins patches are dying and the scientists continue to try to burn out the encroaching substance from the dimension hole. Halloween comes as the boys dress up as Ghostbusters. Jonathan is supposed to watch Will but he leaves to hang out with Nancy at a party where she has got obnoxiously drunk and fought with Steve.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",9
"An extremely well written story of a group of young friends whose selfless altruism out thinks adults and lets their brilliance save the day. We spent our entire Saturday binge watching from beginning to end. The acting was masterful and the plot was unique. The only reason I didn't give it 10 stars was the regular, unwelcome diversions from the core story...why do writers think we like the tired device of the local adolescent sociopaths who harass the heroes? I could not grasp why the bullying scenes were necessary, because the core story had more than enough power to carry the series all the way through. Each relevant character evoked either our sympathy for their triumphs, or satisfaction when they earned justice. We cared about what happened to them - good writing.",9
"This is real good! binged watched the 8 chapters. The only thing I found was the AV teacher roof on his house has dimensional shingles; not available in the 70tys or early 80tys. But I won't nitpick, the acting is good, the story keeps your attention. The story does have holes but everyone is not me and may not take notice. I will be watching for these new talented young actors. Set in a small town filled with nuclear family's living sheltered lives in Cul-de-sac neighborhoods. And of course you have your top secret Government agency conducting mind alternation experiments on young subjects with trails of misconception and cover ups. A chain smoking sheriff with a broken past. The so called creepy kid that works to support his Mom & little brother. And a gang of 11 ish boys with creative imaginations. This is a mishmash full of sci-fi a little bit of the best, X files,Fire starter,Alien, ET, The Goonies.",10
"Quality Science Fiction and Horror stories are a rarity, but I've seen Stranger Things.The brilliant 80's style ""Tron"" music and electrifying title set the mood for this epic adventure. Reminiscent of iconic 80's films like The Goonies and ET, but with the sophistication only a modern series could deliver.High Production Value Visually Interesting Above average performances on the wholeGreat for binge watching under the covers on a cold and rainy night. Truly one for a night of Netflix and ""chillin"".",9
"This is one of the most magical things I have ever had the fortune of viewing. I won't go into details about the narrative, which is build on classic sci-fi and horror concepts and it works. But what really makes this show excel is the little things. The casting is amazing - every single character, regardless of how small the part is, feels like a complete character, and the main cast delivers some powerful stuff all throughout the series. The production is spot on in it's portrayal of a small town in the 80's, and I have to assume that it is in part based on the creators own experiences and childhood, because everything feels real.The only thing that bothered me throughout the entire show was the incompetence of the government entities. I know and understand that this is a popular portrayal of the government in these types of stories and especially in the US is this a common sentiment. But it simply didn't seem believable that they would make some of the choices they did. Doesn't take a genius to see that they are doing a crummy job. But this is all in all a negligible detail, as it keeps the story moving.",10
"*SPOILER ALERT* The overall story line was appealing. The acting ranged from GREAT on the part of Millie Brown and David Harbour, to YAWN on the part of Winona Ryder and Modine.The writers/producers did a great job of trying to make it look authentically 80's, which as WHY... (some asked this)there is so much cigarette smoking going on in it. Having lived through the 80's I can attest, pretty much everybody smoked.Where the story line takes a turn to the ridiculous is towards the end of Episode 5, when Nancy... a young teenage girl dressed in design jeans and clothes decides she will crawl into a dark, slimy, cramped tree trunk! Oh, and she does so AFTER abandoning the guy with a gun and her only other means of protection- a baseball bat! Sorry, NO SALE.Well, I've not finished the series yet, so I may be back to edit this; but for now this is my take on it.",7
"Everyone has got the mix of movies this series combines or rip-offs. Winona Ryder does a great job and is totally believable but she is basically doing a female Richard Dreyfuss in Close Encounters. On the one hand, every role has a parallel in something you've seen before. On the other hand, you can't say that all the actors don't do good jobs or that the show isn't entertaining. Actually very entertaining. I guess the person who steals the show is the young girl who plays ""Eleven"" Millie Bobby Brown and Winona Ryder comes in second and Natalia Dyer is kind of fun to watch as well but nowhere near Ryder or Millie Bobby Brown. But Steven Spielberg and about 6 other directors and writers should have their names added to the credits. But, heh, it's TV. It's Netflix and it is good.",7
"Have been binging on a lot of series on Netflix and when the first peeks of this series came out it felt this would be something with a difference. And it truly was. Being an Indian I may not be able to identify with the 80s nostalgia of Americans but it truly provides a sneak peek into the trends and events that have been smartly woven into the story line. The costumes, the sets, the demeanor, everything seems reminiscent of those times. Now throw in a great 80s background score and over that potboiler of a sci-fi horror thriller. That entire recipe comes out as a unstoppable unputdownable story line that makes you hold your own right until the end. The smart screenplay holds the entire act right from beginning to end. There seem no slip ups and never in the entire season one feels let down by the superb efforts of everyone. All the actors have given a sterling performance with no voids left to fill. Overall a truly well made genius and hoping for more seasons in the follow through.",10
"E.T., Harry Potter, these are the stories that perfectly capture the essence of being kids on an epic adventure. With Stranger Things, there can now be a third story added to that short but illustrious list. You root for these kids, who are not the rude cookie-cutter kids so prevalent in movies today. They are smart and kind and I was with them every step of the way; and the adult cast was every bit as compelling. The story is suspenseful and even a little scary at times, but it is also laugh-out-loud funny. This charming series runs the gamut of emotions, delivering chills, heartbreaking moments, an incredible buddy story, adventure, terrific humor, and lots of twists and turns. These are eight episodes of perfection, as far as I am concerned, and I can't wait to see where this series goes! My only regret is that I watched them all and can never watch it, for the first time, again.",10
"I admit, I was a bit skeptical during the first episode of this series, but nevertheless, this sci-fi gem began to shine brighter and brighter as the story progressed.Stellar performances by every actor from seasoned veterans, Winona Ryder (Joyce), David Harbour (Chief Hopper) and Matthew Modine (Dr. Brenner). However it was the younger actors who stole the show. Kudos to Caleb McLaughlin (Lucas), Noah Schnapp (Will), the lovable Gaten Matarazzo (Dustin) and my favorites; the very talented Finn Wolfhard (Mike) and Millie Bobby Brown (Eleven).I cried like a baby during the climatic *ending*. I groaned when I saw Natalia Dyer (Nancy) with Joe Keery (Steve) instead of Charlie Heaton (Jonathan) and now that I know there's a strong possibility of a sequel to Stranger Things, I am hoping this romance goes my way!Bravo to Netflix for delivering, yet again, a brilliant show worth my time.",10
5 is generous. So surprised and a little horrified to see a rating much higher than six!! I was extremely excited to see Winona as the lead actress but was immediately turned off by her performance. I'm sorry to say it but annoying is the only way to describe it. A definite Super 8 rip off & not nearly as well done despite what other reviewers might say. I'm 4 episodes in with 4 more to go. It's a bit like torture but I will finish watching them. I can't seem to get invested in any of the characters. Mike is OK. I saw one foreign viewer/reviewer refer to it as a masterpiece. RIDICULOUS!! Definitely not! Get real people! X-Files is a 9-10 not this piece of junk!,5
"Enough said. But since I have to write a review, I will say this series is NOT in the league of Game of Thrones, which IS worthy of the high 9 rating. Sorry to say, but it's pretty much every cheesy 80's sci-fi B/Horror movie wrapped in one, with equally cheesy Goonie-ish actors. I gave it a slightly above average rating for the acting ability of the Eleven..the other kids constant, loud bickering and cliché teenage love/angst was getting unbearable by the 5th episode with no reprieve in the episodes that follow... Ryder & Modine did a decent enough job. The only thing which really irked me with Ryder was the awful shaggy haircut she had.",5
"Just finished binge watching it. I'm just in love with the setting, the universe they bring back to us. Did you ever wanted that E.T or Goonies went on for 8 hours??? This was it. Just top notch production top to bottom, easter eggs everywhere and many goodies to enjoy a fine piece of work. Characters are lovable an relatable. The story arch was clear and well designed even with twists like the redemption of the douche jock and the ""odd couple born from distress"" not ending up together, with a just enough open ending that probably will stay like that and that's fine (I won't complain if there's a second season, but these guys will probably end up getting some big franchise to write and direct like the Russo brothers did (What is it about brothers working together... Just Magnific. Even the Washowskis in some points)Obviously this doesn't reinvents the genre, but it was an excellent work from everybody involved in the production. You can feel the 80 's alive in this one and if you have little boys you can show them how it felt to be a kid back then, to be a child watching the world through TV and movies.And to the hipsters that think that this was an average series i tell them to go a write a soul for them. Because if you go and find these mediocre ""at best"" (as someone said) i feel really sorry for you and probably your family hates spending Christmas with you.I'm 37 years old and for 8 hours i was 7 again. And that's priceless for me.Just watch it. Really...",8
"I won't write long, because it is my first review on IMDb. I've just finished watching Stranger Things. I am so agitated... I need more. Oh God, I need so more. I haven't watched so good series for a long time. Everything in it is perfect, even music. The girl who plays Eleven is perfect. I don't know if someone could play it better. Millie Bobby Brown did a great job and now her ""star gate"" is for sure open. Friendship between Mike, Dustin and Lucas is so believable and realistic. Like I was watching best friends on screen. Dustin! Dustin is such a great guy! Gaten Matarazzo did also great job. Oh Lord. I don't know what else should I write. I think that's it. Now I'm gonna lay down on my bed and think all Sunday about everything.This is the series of 2016.And YOU HAVE TO WATCH THIS.NOW.IMMEDIATELY.",10
"I usually get bored with a series after the 4th or 5th episode, but Stranger Things kept me straight through to the end. If anyone remembers the first Phantasm, this will take you back to the thrill and excitement you had when you were a kid. First, the music track was spot on. I can't say enough about how they created a mood. The use of classic synths is what brought us back to the late 70's and early 80's. Nailed it! Story never became corny, even with a few corny kids. Added to the realism of how dorky we were at that age. Eleven, the main character, was brilliant acting. I cannot wait until the next series. I hope it is as fantastic as this one. I am sure it will be, if they keep the lineup. Fantastic job guys!",10
"I thought it was wonderful. It reminded me of so many of my favorite things. Stephen King, Stephen Spielberg, The Goonies and on and on. other review's site other examples of how it took the reviewers back.It took the best pieces and parts from amazing outlets and spun it into an original masterpiece.It had action, it had romance, it had friendship and coming of age, it had horror, and conspiracy,it had sweetness, hope, failure, and triumph.I know people now a days try to outdo each other with who can find the most inaccuracies and plot holes, but just sit back and watch this like you sat back in the eighties as a significantly younger person who still found joy and wonder in the world and watch nerdy friends rise above their potential, watch the unlikely hero save everyone, watch young kids fall in love for the first time, watch a mother fight for her child no matter how crazy she looks, watch a sheriff find redemption, watch that horrifying monster that is somehow comforting because he represents every other monster you've ever seen, watch the bad guys lose.It didn't answer all the questions brought about through the season, and your not quite sure the bad guys are finished but I hope that's because they plan on bringing along a second season.Remember the pure magic of seeing a film for the first time before you discovered the internet and found out that everything was flawed and could see hundreds of people point out every tiny mistake? That's what this series was like for me. I was so enthralled I forgot to be rating and judging it and I just went along for the ride.",10
"Well, i've never written a review here nor am I an expert at this genre but all day I have been thinking, by God, this was such an incredible series and experience. Captivating, creepy and fun sci-fi horror.. this is really groundbreaking for a debut by two brothers.The acting was so on-point as well as the set designs, story and action.The point that sticks with me most right now has to be one of the last scenes that mirrors most of what we are all thinking at the end. One month after this horror, the kids are playing their D&G game again, this time, they know to fireball monster out of experience and that it is, defeated. ""Woah, that's it?"" - exclaims one. ""The campaign was too short"" - cries another. ""It was 10 hours long"" - replies the game master ""It doesn't make any sense."" ""what about the lost knights?"" ""..and the proud princess?"" ""And those weird flowers in the cave?!"" ""I don't know, it's...."" And they are all interrupted.That is the genius of this series. It mirrors our thoughts right now. ""Just 8 episodes?"", ""What about the girl?"", What about the future? What about the cover-ups? Does everybody know?And you know, that is the genius of fantasy and the genius of the story writing. There it is, right there. It is a fantasy and it just... damn... works well when told in the most spectacular, impressive, engaging story and experience.Stranger Things absolutely nailed it.",10
"This may contain spoilers.For some reason I expected a sci-fi series, not a horror one. I'm sure it wasn't just me - several of my friends who were excited about this show (and told me about it) clearly said sci-fi multiple times. We were wrong.""Stranger Things"" is a mediocre, uninteresting, seen-it-a-million-times (soft-ish) horror series that tries to ride on the back of 80's nostalgia by ripping off every 80's movie you can think of.Some reviewers compared this movie to E.T. and it is true - the cinematography strongly resembles Spielberg's work (not the quality or the story, mind you). Otherwise that comparison is very unfair: E.T. is an intelligent, charming, emotion-evoking sci-fi and none of that applies to this series. If you read comparisons to other 80's movies, they're probably partially correct because ""Stranger Things"" likely ripped those off, too.The movie is frequently dark to the point where you can hardly see anything on the screen, there's a lot of screeching and screaming and some killing and blood and there's a monster in it for some reason but I don't believe much is revealed about its back-story. What story is present is nonsensical and is simply reused from other horror stories. Nothing original here.Acting is mostly OK (the kids were over the top a few times; nothing too bad). I do feel sorry for Winona Ryder for acting in this - I haven't seen her in a role for a while but I recall her being a good actress (she was OK in this one) and I think she could do better.If you're a horror fan, you may rate it higher but over 9? No way - that would mean this is somehow in the company of ""The Shawshank Redemption"" or ""Schindler's List"". I think this series is about 3 out of 10.",2
"What can I say?If you love E.T., The Goonies, Firestarter, IT, The Thing, and lived part of your life in the 80's, this show feels like a comfortably broken in boot. The look, feel, and style of this show will constantly hit you with nostalgia and that warm fuzzy feeling you get when everything in a house is a different shade of brown.It takes a BIG chunk of the stories of the above mentioned movies/books but combines them in a way that keeps things interesting without seeming TOO familiar or plagiarized (most of the time), the main exception being Eleven who is pretty much a copy paste of Charlene ""Charlie"" McGee from Steven King's book/movie Firestarter (with the addition of a few new powers).Well worth the 8 hour viewing time, can't wait for more, the next year is going to be a long one.",10
"I grew up watching eighties' stuff like Goonies, Gremlins, E.T. and all of that stuff, and of course wonderful horror like Evil Dead, Nightmare on Elm Street the Thing and Jaws, and this series struck that nerve like a jackhammer. From the bikes, to the Dungeons and Dragons, the hair and basically everything. This show is basically a love letter to the spielbergian action movies for kids, and unlike other similar attempts, like Turbo Kid, it's not a parody.Also: great acting (especially the kids), superb casting, wonderful set design and dramaturgy. Easy 10/10 for me on this one, and praying for a season two. Rarely have I been able to watch seven episodes without a single break. More stuff like this Netflix.",10
"New 80s is trending right now. However, this series offered a sense of nostalgia rarely felt in other movies and series such as this one.Character exploration is beautifully done, and most characters have idiosyncratic traits which makes them quite interesting. Each character's history also ties into the main story line perfectly, leaving few loose ends. The acting is on point with some strong performances and directing is brilliant in regards to the mood being created and the intricate details of the 80s era. Together they've certainly been able to create a wonderful and terrifying world with an original and fascinating story-line.This series features kids, teens and adults and I really feel as if they are there to offer that enhanced sense of nostalgia. I certainly doubt it was to appeal to younger kids which this series is obviously not directed towards. Most of us have lived through such experiences and ordeals, so it offers that sense of ubiquitous normalcy, but which is set against the backdrop of complete chaos which shatters that false sense of security, the perfect way to create a reality-disrupting nightmare.One of the few drawbacks was its predictability. I didn't even have to try to guess what would happen next, I just did. I might have enjoyed a few sleight of hand misdirection plot twists but this still really falls in line with classic 80s movies, so even that was welcomed here.and the soundtrack is just an absolute bonus.Which is why I gave this a 10/10, they couldn't have done it any better. I am certainly bias, being a huge fan of everything 80s, sci-fi, horror and new retro wave, but this is an absolutely memorable series that will stay with me for a very long time.",10
"Hello viewers ,I stumbled across this series just going through trailers on youtube a days back, My taste is very different when it comes to watching movies or TV-series, Its the first episode if it impresses me or the first 20 minutes of the movie, then I go aheaad and watch it completely,I had been very fond of watching X-files during school-days, after that I didn't come across a series so engaging and fascinating as this, Seriously I must say , the whole team of this show has put in a mind- blowing effort to make it super thrilling with the added mysterical background music and the hair-raising environment.I give 10 out of 10 rating for making this show a reality!!",10
"Wow, this show is amazing. It contains a perfect balance of everything you would ask for in a show.I love the fact that it feels like I'm watching an 80s classic.Each and every episode contains the quality of a blockbuster movie, the camera work is steady and just like a Spielberg movie, and the music and actors tie together everything.My favorite character is the sheriff. The costume design and and set look great, and not for a moment it feels like I'm watching a show.Great job to the directors!I don't have a single complaint for this show.",10
"Netflix's newest monster mystery mini-series, Stranger Things, is a lovingly made homage to the kinds of 80's horror and adventure films that I loved as a kid. Combining John Carpenter, Steven Spielberg and Stephen King, the Duffer Brothers somehow create an entirely fresh feeling and unexpectedly engrossing sci-fi series. The highlight for me is the group of D+D loving misfit school friends (particularly the toothless Dustin) who are forced to get their act together, Goonies style, to deal with the disappearance of their friend Will Byers. There's plenty of comedy in these endearingly nerdy boys that contrasts brilliantly with the darker, supernatural elements of the show. Winona Ryder, too, stood out for me as the frazzled parent of the missing child, providing some very memorable moments. Can't recommend this highly enough.",9
"Right at the beginning - is this a good show? Yes. Is this the best thing since sliced bread? No. I don't think that the show deserves so much praise as it gets. There's almost a pathological sense of nostalgia nowadays and I would ascribe a lot of the series success to it's setting in the 80's. The feeling of the ""good old days"" is so abundant in the audience that they'll swallow pretty much anything with the retro vibe and continue to ask for more. So, let's put off those nostalgia glasses and be realistic. The series deserves praise for the execution since it's good enough to keep you engaged and make you binge watch the whole season. On the other hand, so many things have already been seen in other movies/series that there's no sense of originality (at least for me). If you are a long term fan of the genre, there's almost nothing new to see here. But if you're a newcomer, this will be a nice initiation into this type of movies/series and hopefully it will encourage you to dig deeper and find all the other works that inspired this one. For the beginning start with the one I've put in the tittle. Happy hunting.",8
"Very pleasant surprise. Netflix and Duffer bros pretty much nailed it.An elaborate and hard working homage to John Carpenter, Spielberg, Raimi, Stephen King and other horror-adventure masters of the 70's and 80's that also stands on it's own legs.While Stranger Things does lack sometimes finely timed emotional punch and doesn't go full escalation in some cases, it still blinds with quality. From atmosphere to music, nice story, good characters and damn fine actors, this Netflix show is a great viewing.I'm not going to spoil anything, story is interesting and if show's synopsis here is not enough for you, then you'll just have to check the show for yourself. It does play with some sci-fi/horror standards, sometimes diving in completely, sometimes defying them but almost always is treating it's story and legacy with respect.Yes, it is a bit of nostalgia-bate but it uses that as an advantage and not cheap gimmick, which I find important to make it more distinct from other projects that solely bank on cheap nostalgic tricks.I'm totally recommending it and hoping that we'll get Season 2 or something similar.",8
"I loved this show ""Stranger Things'(no spoilers below).It was a real nostalgia trip, with some excellent and strong performances by many child actors as well as from Winona Ryder and the many adult veteran actors in its strong ensemble cast.Great suspense, a plot and narrative that moves quickly and likable characters that you can't help empathize with.There are also some dastardly villains and plenty off a$%^% holes to hate and many people in between - the characterization was spot on.I LOVED the setting. The nostalgia trip for the period is intoxicating, there's also some cool off-beat humour with the Goonies-like gang (who I find to be actually more likable than the kids in the Goonies).Their Camaraderie anchors the series - I did not regret staying up all night watching.As a former Dungeon Master myself (briefly), I could relate to the Dungeons & Dragons references, and I feel they used the motif well to accompany the plot and themes of the story.Would like to see a 2nd season.",10
"This is a fantastic horror/comedy. I was so pleasantly surprised as I began watching this. It is funny, scary, dramatic, and heartwarming... Usually all in one scene.The story is really about relationships...The good and the bad ones. Every relationship in this series is complex to say the least. I've never seen something quite like it.The acting is super. The music always fitting. The production quality grade A.There is a gang of kids that reminded me of the Goonies...mischievous, fearless, hilarious, and totally adventurous.I won't say much about the plot, because I watched it blind and am so glad I did.",10
"I ended up binge-watching the entire season - 4 episodes yesterday and 4 tonight - like so many others!! I thought it was excellent! I'm not even a huge ""80's"" era fan, but this show managed to find the very best of that decade and bring it to positive light. The homage to the films and writers was so well done and the music was amazing! Parts of the show reminded me of ""The Goonies"" and ""Stand By Me"" as well. After I watched the entire season, I realized I was thoroughly entertained and without a single scene of gratuitous violence or sex, something that much of today's programming relies on vs. back in the 80's or earlier. I found it refreshing and yes it's something a family can actually watch together (although very young children might be frightened by the monster). The only reason I did not rate this show a 10 is I thought Ryder's character was a bit too much at times. The constant hysterics wore me out for the first half of the season but it did get better in the second half. I understand she was a panicked mother so I can't put a finger on it. I just found Joyce a little annoying. I'm not sure if that was an acting or writing flaw so I will leave it at that. That was minor though and I still would recommend this show wholeheartedly!! I hope they bring it back for more season(s)!",9
"The Duffer Brothers are master chefs. I picture them around a stove arrayed with pots.""Let's add a dash of 'The Goonies', sprinkle in some 'Stand By Me', a generous cupful of 'E.T.', a spritz of 'Poltergeist' and garnish with 'Tron'.""They expertly captured the essence of 80's movies while at the same time telling a suspenseful and thrilling story. I excitedly watched episode after episode and felt satisfied after each viewing. Nothing went to waste. Each character was fully explored, each plot line fully developed, and in the end I felt more satisfied than when I binged on too much Christmas turkey and lay half comatose under the tree playing Space Invaders on the green shag carpet of my family room floor.Whoever the Duffer Brothers are, I wish to convey my heartfelt appreciation for this AMAZING show.P.S. The casting and acting were spot ON! Eleven, Mike, Dustin, and Lucas stole the show.",10
"I will actually give this show a overall 5.5 or 7 in some good scenes but I see a lot of crazy people gave 10 stars? Are you fuking crazy? So I have to give it a 2 to trying to make it reflect the true star worthy!This TV series is so boring so slow and so messy, the ending scene clearly is an after thought for season 2! The plot has too many unclear things, it's just too much flaw...The casting is very on point, most of the actors are quite good but maybe the casting is so on piont it becomes very stereotype and cliché!I don't see why people go crazy for this tbh! I only watch it because I was bored",2
"All the previous reviews have said it all: Great, constant '80s nostalgia references, great fun but at the same time truly troubling and terrifying, great acting and storytelling.Yeah, the first episode overdoes the '80s allusions a little, and the Chief is a little over the top as a dorky wastrel, and the kids can be a little TOO kid-ish, but still you have to watch the second episode, and by then you're hooked, and the binge is on.Great, engrossing fun all the way, constant action, some great acting, especially from Winona Ryder, tender-hearted, wise, and doesn't talk down to the audience. Btw, the first binge for my wife and me--we just couldn't stop!",10
"I have seen a lot of new shows make their debut on network TV, Premium Cable, and of course streaming services like Amazon and Netflix. But this... Phenomenal show, imo best new show of 2016. The whole cast is excellent but Winona Ryder as Joyce Byers deserves Emmy Award consideration next year. Her being a Hollywood actress i expected great but this was masterclass character work. Winona has had some exception performances over two decades but this was one of the best of her career, maybe top 5 in her career. Also the performance from child actress Millie Brown as El aka Eleven is also amazing and is the 2nd best performance behind Ryder. This isn't the first show of this current generation to try and capture a artistic, creepy, and psychological noir style of an 80's film vibe... but unlike the others it nailed it perfectly. The first season is literally flawless in all phases ( only the snarkiest of reviewers and critics will find something to nitpick ). This is a must watch for everyone. Season 1 was only 2nd to Person Of Interest's 5th and final season on my ""Best season of any show this year"" List.",10
OK I just finished seeing the series all in one breath; eight thrilling episodes. You are nostalgic of the 1980s? You like the goonies? X-files? Visitors? Have you played Atari? Do you know what Dungeons and dragons? If the answer is always yes then with this series take center you will have an adrenaline rush that will take you back in time of 36 years. And if the atmosphere in which it's set did not satisfied with everything so well conceived a storyline will take care that you'll be hooked on the chairs until the very last minute. The theme song of the series is brilliant!!! If you have doubt in trying Netflix this series will make you change your mind.,10
I really liked the first episodes. they really gave me chill but the rest of series got really predictable for me. I think if they didn't show a real physical figure for the alien whatsoever until the end it could be more interesting. knowing that we are dealing with! some douche carnivorous plant head aliens that are not really that scary and easily can be knocked down by kids just reduces the excitement of the series.flashbacks were not that amazing still kinda predictable. I could imagine what she had gone through in a classic 80s crazy scientists' experiments myself.Overall it was fun to watch it back to back but not really seeing the potential for this TV series to go any further for having more seasons.,7
"I've used IMDb for at least 10 years now.I never thought about making a review until I saw the first 4 episodes of Stranger Things. What is remarkable about this TV Show is the story writing, 90s nostalgia, the superb acting and everything else! There is never a boring or dull moment. You have everything from Theory of Relativity to teenage girl problems.It is one of those rare stories where a lot of craziness rules the world, but where all the characters are credible, like Lost or Game of Thrones.I have to say, I don't like to make any comparisons to other shows, like I just did. Because you will not know what to expect, since we live in a time where Hollywood mass produces generic Crime series with different covers. This show is truly original and will intrigue you.",10
"STRANGER THINGS was a pleasant surprise. It sprawled comfortably on Netflix's browsing page very recently. Needless to say, I binged all eight (8) episodes in one sitting.STRANGER THINGS, as mentioned in several other reviews, is the ""fruit smoothie"" of 80s culture. Take in a tablespoon of Stephen King, a few dashes of Spielberg, and a whole lot of 80s horror/thriller culture, blend it together and you essentially have STRANGER THINGS.To start off, the fact that this is NOT a reboot or sequel to a film or television show that debuted in the 80s time period is actually relieving. Not that I necessarily have anything against that, but this series really goes to show that an original concept can still be filled with nostalgia but have its own identity. Hopefully, that will encourage future film/series creators.Regarding the show itself, I found myself on several occasions praising the acting (ESPECIALLY by the children), and engrossed with the plot. I can most definitely appreciate the choice of having this as a television show as opposed to a short movie. It really gave a chance to flesh things out. The plot, while relatively simple, is filled with several cliché tropes - however, they are utilized much differently, which is another thing I happened to enjoy. The ""walking backwards and accidentally tripping over something"" action DOES NOT lead to a death. The car engine actually STARTED. The girl actually doesn't give too much of a damn (romantically) about the nerdy/weird/outcast guy EVEN AFTER EXPERIENCING A LIFE-CHANGING SITUATION together. Again: a breath of fresh air.My only real gripe with the show had to be the ending. However, this is all hypothetical and essentially not solid. The plot really showcases itself as a one season deal - however, the show creators already confirmed that season two would be a sequel to season 1. I felt that season one's ending should have been more conclusive as opposed to purposely leaving many loose ends to pick up in season two. HOWEVER, if season two does pick up these loose ends and thread them into something even more awesome, then it's a win-win situation and I will be happy with season one's ending. Also, to nitpick, the underlying themes of ""mystery"" and ""folklore"" seem to be muddled and messy. Individually, the themes are very strong from an episode-to- episode basis; sadly, as a whole, the show really loses these themes and you're left with a pure thriller-adventure as opposed to the cool dark sci-fi feeling.+awesome characters+superb acting+engrossing plot-possibly weak ending-muddled directionSTRANGER THINGS - binge-worthy - 9/10",9
"The story line is gripping from the start, this is not a series i would have normally watched but my husband loves sci-fi. Well worth watching, it is a well-balanced series where the viewer can relate to the characters and it has just the right amount of weird. The story is based around the search for a missing boy, the boys friends and relatives start searching and all start to realise that something unusual and unexplained is the cause of the boys disappearance. The boys friends get the help of a young girl who arrived in town the same time as the boys disappearance, as her story unravels the boys start to realise they have much to learn and vow to find their friend. The plot takes many twists and turns.",10
"Stranger Things is a total flashback to everything that you loved about the 80's! I had the perfect amount of scare factor, anxiety, and nostalgic qualities that I look for in any TV show.The Cast of mostly unknown children: Will, Mike, Lucas, & Dustin did a very believable job to sell this story. Don't get me wrong there are a few parts that will make you chuckle during this 8 hour adventure but those same parts to me made it all the better. I loved the premise of the entire show and found myself numerous times wanting to look away or cover my eyes knowing something was coming and I DID NOT want to see it. The score and music in this series was amazing as well.I am very happy to see Winona Ryder back on TV and she played the Character of Joyce Byers perfectly. Very Believable. I thought her entire performance was great!The remaining supporting cast was also great. David Harbour as Chief Jim Hopper was great as well. He brought the real emotion and feel to his role and the minor subplot that slowly unravels up to the final reveal was amazing. Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven was also Amazing! Every scene she graced was that much better and just her facial expressions alone showed so much emotion. Her subplot as well was wonderful to watch slowly unwind to the reveal as well.I really hope they are able to spin this off for a second season and they left us with that ONE single moment to make it possible and for us viewers to cross our fingers and wait.If you are looking for a great serious with an 80's feel and a fun spin on everything you loved from that era prepare to Binge!",10
"The moment I saw the intro to this show I was transported back to the 80's! I got this euphoria feeling of being a kid again watching those big 80's movies when I still could awed by films... that's when I knew this show was something else.I think this is the best show by Netflix (yes, including House of Cards and Marco Polo, both of which I love) The nostalgia feeling mixed with great acting, story, script, directing make for an awesome series. It felt like a Stephen King story (IT came to mind), hope they make a season 2!Adult actors are all great but it's the kids that run this show... All main kid characters are well rounded and these young actors did a fantastic job.Two thumbs way up.",10
"I haven't really been a fan of Netflix originals apart from How to make a murderer, Narcos and Bloodlines, but after watching the trailer for this I had big expectations. And man, i was not let down! Watching these 8 episodes has been one hell of a ride. This show got everything. Great cast, tremendous acting, a true 80's feel and the highest level of excitement you will get in a TV show. The story is really, really good! Can't wait for Season 2. If you haven't watched it yet you are in for a treat. The ratings don't lie! I love everything about this show. The soundtrack is amazing. This show really takes me back to the 80s. Someone mentioned it's like a mix of x-files and E.T and he is right, only this is even better than those two combines. I think it has a Guilerme Del Toro feel to it, but that does not by any means mean it's not original. it is!",10
"This was the nostalgia itch that I didn't know that I needed scratched. After so many reboots and remakes from my childhood that ultimately fail to deliver more than a hint of what made the originals great, I determined that I must be getting too old and cynical to appreciate things in the same way as I used. It's only a matter of time until I become the ""they don't make them like they used to"" guy. Stranger Things laughs at the notion that the wonder and adventure from that time period can't be recreated, and makes it obvious what the other attempts at capturing this have missed. It doesn't show you that you are in that you are back in your childhood by putting a kid in an Indiana Jones costume and dressing teenagers in loud clothes with big hair. It makes you feel it with a hundred little details that you forgot about and I can't thank the creators enough. Somebody still makes them like they used to, and apparently, I'm still capable of being able to have the same wonder, joy and investment that I did all those years ago.",10
This is some of the best TV I've seen for quite some time. I would say it's more like a Steven King story rather then a Steven Spielberg movie. It's a great mix of the paranormal and sci-fi and as a fan of this kind of genre I had an idea by halfway through the series what was going on. Many of the principal characters are kids but kids stuff it certainly is not. All of the young cast are good but I think Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven really steals the show like Ellie Fanning in Super 8. I'd have to say that the sinister government agency responsible for all distress brought to the Hawkins community were rather sloppy and in reality they would have found the girl (Eleven) a lot sooner. I have a feeling we have not seen the last of her. We know that Sheriff Hooper made some kind of deal with the government agents but it's not clear at this point exactly what it was. It does have a satisfactory ending but with enough loose ends for a further season. Hopefully there is enough interest in this show for a DVD release at some point. Most of the reviews (mine included) have been generally favorable and I do hope that it will have enough of an audience worldwide to give the go ahead for a series two and I also hope that we don't have to wait an entire year for it but more then likely we will.,10
"10/10 Being an 80's kid I loved the setting of this. Giant walkie talkies, 80's jeans (don't miss those!), cycling everywhere with your friends. I loved that everything was 80' even the title and credit fonts, the theme tune that also features in parts of the episodes is fun and mysterious. Casting is excellent which is commendable considering there are many child actors involved. I love the idea of this story showing the kids perspective also. What I love in a series too is when there is a cliffhanger the mystery is opened up in the following episode rather than dragging out story lines for the sake of a longer season. however I also would have been quite happy with a few more episodes as I enjoyed it so much. Can't wait for season 2.",10
"whole story is great. I loved the concept of the series but it is not at all original concept as it is taken from the movie INSIDIOUS. since i loved the concept of the movie i loved it too. The main difference between the concept of the movie and 'stranger things' is that there are monsters on the other side of the world which is stated as 'the upside down', and in the movie it is the devil itself in 'the further'. Another thing i would like to share is that in the series the monsters are kill-able which is good from the perspective of a kid. Overall great experience watching the series. waited for long, for such a great experience. Thanks to all the ones who made this awesome series. Excellent work guys, keep it up.",9
"This is a good show, I like horror/the supernatural, I love(d) the 80ies, it's good to see Wynona again, etc., however, as with Super 8, there is something holding me back from really being able to enjoy this: my gender. All the related/quoted movies/shows (Goonies, Super 8, It, etc.) are from a little boy's viewpoint and experience, celebrating being a boy in the 80ies, doing boy stuff with other boys. Since I am NOT a boy and I did NOT hang with boys (like Alice in Super 8) and I did not have brothers or sons in the 80ies either, I cannot fully relate/identify myself with the nostalgia/ image being shown (and don't get started about that weird girl ""11"", no identification possible/desirable here, either). If I think about what I expected during the 80ies to happen for women and feminism in the future, I am aghast. The situation for women over the last years rather has deteriorated than improved. And hearing African American men complaining about Hollywood/the Academy - they should trying to be a (any) woman!! Kit Harrington being offended that he is slightly reduced to his looks?? Is he for real? Has he been in a coma from his birth on not to realize what it is (still) like for women (in Hollywood and elsewhere)? We are still being heavily discriminated (and offended), not treated (and paid) equal, seen as prey, treated careless (or even violent), being reduced/objectified, not allowed the same things, etc. etc. I know it will never change, and this is just a minor example, but it still IS rude and careless of producers and writers to shut girls out like this and not caring if a program is okay for them, too. I do NOT want to be reduced to love stories (hate it), Grey's Anatomy (hate it) etc. - I want to be considered for any other non-feminine-clichéd genre as well. But as I said: I know, it's never gonna happen, if it didn't happen in the 80ies, it will surely not happen in this reactionary millennium - you women out there know what I am talking about, you go along with the stream like dead fish, feminism is dead.",5
"Where do I begin? This show may only be 8 episodes long but I have never seen such a diverse cast - where not one person fails to impress, each character has star turns and gets a chance to shine - something than many other shows lack. Eleven (Millie Brown) is an absolute stand out in this sci-fi show, and it is fantastic how much you take the journey with her throughout this. No matter of your age, she is the constant stand out in each scene. The direction and editing in this show has been put to amazing use and its as if you are a part of this journey with the characters yourself, it's like you are reading a book and going through each chapter, constantly wanting to read the next. The writing on this show is perfect and when it really hits the high - it stays there, we as a viewer are taken on an emotional roller coaster from start to finish. You believe every scene is as important as the last one and it's good to play close attention to the amount of detail that has been put in to each and every shot, cinematography is beautiful and you can see that the background is used to its full impact. There is this constant reminder of being a child and learning about friendship and love throughout life to when we grow through our teenage years to an adult & parent. All of this along with the fantastic 80's vibe and stand out Soundtrack throughout makes this for an even better watch and works fantastically well. If you were to mix Stephen Spielberg with Stephen King and John Carpenter you have basically got Stranger Things! This isn't just the stand out show of 2016 it's one of the biggest stand out shows ever made in the last 15-20 years and Stranger Things will be talked about for years to come, it is relevant now and will be for many years to come! I for one am already excited for watching this a 2nd time around.",10
"First time reviewer here at IMDb but I had to write a review to say how much I enjoyed this show. In my opinion, it's far and away the best series so far from Netflix, surpassing Making a Murderer as my favorite original Netflix production.Stranger Things was not overly hyped by Netflix, and with 'stars' like Winona Ryder, Matthew Modine and David Harbour, it's not a production featuring many of today's hotter Hollywood actors and actresses. Throw in a rather small budget in terms of sets and special effects, and it's safe to say that I did not have big expectations for this show upon watching the first episode.But from the very first 10 minutes of the superb first episode, the show drags you in and won't let you go. Eight episodes in all, the middle few episodes perhaps drag on a bit, but episodes 1-3, and 7-8 in particular are stunners.The basic premise is a young boy goes missing amidst a series of very bizarre (and at times scary) events in the fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana. Ryder is the young boy's distraught mom. Harbour is the well-intending local sheriff who is trying to figure out just what in the heck is happening in his small town. Modine is the creepy scientist in charge of some weird experiments that the top- secret Department of Energy complex is conducting (why they are based in the middle of Indiana is never quite explained).The whole series takes place in the winter of 1983, and as someone who was still a teenager in that era, I can vouch that the costumes, props and look of every episode is spot on. It frequently pays homage to movies from that era such as ET, The Thing, Stephen King horror films and books, as well as newer movies that also took on a similar theme (Super 8).But while Super 8 ultimately disappointed me with a poor ending and acting that never drew you in, Stranger Things succeeds with strong writing from start to finish, and actors who you truly sympathize with and feel empathy for. The series is carried by the young actors, who across the board are great whether they are portraying heroes, nerds or creeps.Topping the production was Millie Bobby Brown as the supernatural heroine Eleven. She is going to be a future star in Hollywood, mark my words. The four young actors playing her friends (and Will, the boy they are trying to save) are also solid but not quite as memorable.After Eleven, my favorite two performers were Natalia Dyer as Nancy Wheeler, a teenage girl trying to come to terms with her sexuality and maturity; and Charlie Heaton as Jonathan Byers, Will's weird older brother who is trying to keep his family sane in a very tragic situation. Dyer could easily pass for Mia Sara's daughter. Heaton looks he could be Bill Hader's son.Kudos too to the Duffer Brothers for keeping the production moving along at a brisk level. And while the series wraps up with a mostly positive ending, there are just a few hints thrown out at the end to suggest that Stranger Things may still be in store in the future of poor Hawkins, Indiana.So if you're a fan of Stephen King, early 1980's tributes, and science fiction, give Stranger Things a chance. You'll be very happy you did.",10
"Netflix, you've done it again. Another quality production. The cast were excellent, the story-line fresh and new and the script was riveting and exciting. UNFORTUNATELY, ... I got overly excited and watch all 8 episodes in one day. I should have stretched it out but, hey, ... I loved it. I do have a question, however. There seemed to be an opening for another season at the end. Am I right? I realize that may not have been the intention but I know that I would certainly love to see another one. Of course, bringing back El would have to be a foregone conclusion. I would also have to agree with a previous reviewer that mentioned that the government entourage was pretty weak in this series. I would suggest beefing them up and making them more believable in any future effort.",9
"It's the perfect mini series featuring all genres: Mystery, Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Love, Adventure, Horror, all of the above! A gr8 series your whole family will enjoy. Targets anybody, all ages. The Producers have done a gr8 job with each characters scripts, which keeps you on edge with what's going to happen next.I love all the young actors, especially El, she does an amazing job at acting! The whole story line was well needed thought out, and pulls at every one of your emotions.I can't wait to see a sequel, and can only guess what will happen next. I rate it a 10/10! Totally worth while watching:)",10
"This show is unique and stands on its own. The setting (1983) was extremely well done and made people my age feel like it was their childhood again.It's good to see that out of all the same formula shows being put out there, and disappointing ""sci-fi"" shows (I'm looking at you Sense8) that something new and refreshing comes.I was hooked from the first episode and watched it for all 7ish hours straight. The kid actors do a fantastic job as do the adults.The ending is both satisfying and leaves plenty of questions (not in a bad way) that will easily lead to a second season. Absolutely terrific show, can't recommend highly enough.",10
"This show has great actors, a very well-written plot that keeps you in suspense every epidsode. I binged watched all 8 shows in two days. Reasons to watch this show - characters' emotions and reactions are much more true to real life than how most shows are written, 80's nostalgia that isn't all ruffle skirts, sprayed feathered hair, and blue eyeshadow; the episodes are written as chapters of a story and not separate episodes. I also like how not all of the information is given to you right away, hence great writing of a serial show. Episodic shows are stories each in their own tied together with an inner story. This show is like watching a book your reading. I like that and so did my kids. They couldn't get enough of it. I like that each character has their own flaws and there's no perfect hero. I can't think of anything to improve upon. The special effects were great and believable. There wasn't too much of it either. Maybe the only unbelievable part is the character of the the science teacher. He's a little too naive. And the bullies are a little too extreme. Most kids would back down and never say a word if they saw what Eleven could do. Bullies usually back down once challenged. After the kid peed himself, I can't imagine he would go back for more. There's very few people that would keep up that kind of hatred.Love the show. Want more.",9
"On the surface, the new Netflix original series ""Stranger Things"" is a science fiction/paranormal thriller set in a small 1980's suburban town where a group of kids and others confront mysterious and terrifying forces. However more importantly, this series is a marriage of elements from classic Spielberg and Stephen King, and acts as a love letter to 80's cinema. Direct or subtle references are made to ""The Thing"", ""Halloween"", ""It"", ""The Goonies"", ""Stand By Me"", ""E.T."", ""Carrie"", ""Jaws"", ""The Shining"", ""Poltergeist"", ""Evil Dead"", and possibly even more films that I did not recognize. Combining these clever homages to classic cinema with incredible pacing, cinematography, soundtrack, and performances makes this series one of my absolute favorites. I highly recommend giving this series a look even if you don't understand the many homages and references just because of how well this show is directed. I would even describe the small town setting, mysterious antagonistic forces, dramatic pacing, and desperate investigation for truth as a more easily digestible form of True Detective season 1, another absolute favorite of mine. Another comparison likely to be made is to J.J. Abrams ""Super 8"", however the narrative similarities are simply due to both of these works accomplishing the same thing, giving an appreciative and nostalgic nod to Spielberg's classic work. If I had to choose some weaker elements of ""Stranger Things"", I suppose they would be predictability in the plot and lack of complexity in the dialogue.TLDR: I loved it, definitely give it a shot",9
"Thank you Netflix! Stranger Things to me is a masterpiece in so many ways. The directing, the acting, the setting, the feeling is spot on. All acting is above par with a roller-coaster of emotions mixed with drama, suspense, comedy and the overall mixture of the characters works well. Bringing the audience back to the 80's is an understatement, they do it perfect and it feels good. The ET/Goonies/X-Files environment this show carries to the audience is a total win. It makes me feel very special to watch a show of this high caliber. Oh yeah.. Excellent soundtrack for sure! 10 out of 10 and it deserves much more!I very much hope more seasons will be released, as I assume there will be. It is going to be very hard patiently waiting for more.",10
"Much have been written about this series love for the early 80s. And it's understandable. The whole period of John Carpenter, Steven Spielberg, teenage horror-movies and cold war paranoia has been mixed together to a real tasty love potion. If you're too young and don't love the 80s for sentimental reasons you probably will after a few episodes of Stranger Things.The story is set in a small rural town and revolves around a missing boy. His friends is soon dragged into a mystery and an adventure. Goonies and I.T. with the BMX bikes, nerds turning into heroes and a friendship story worthy a Spielberg movie. But there is so much more. The older sister have her own problems and her adventure makes an equally intriguing and fun story including all the ingredients for a classic high school horror movie. Under age drinking, skinny dipping and stupid boyfriends. And finally there is the confused and distraught mother and the towns sheriff also trying to solve the mystery.What impresses me the most is how the series manages to keep all three parts of the plot relevant and interesting all the way to the climax. The pacing is mostly perfect and so is the acting. The child characters are all well played, specially Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven and the funny character Dustin played by Gaten Matarazzo. Of course Winona Ryder is brilliant as the desperate mother.The 80s atmosphere is well set with great horror sequences with the mandatory light flickering, scare jumps and electronic music that could have been made by John Carpenter. There is a lot of John Carpenter stuff going on here and it's great. Some of the inspirations for the series are even featured in one way or the other. Stephen King, The Thing, Michael Myers, and a few more.The only weaknesses I can find here is the somewhat uninteresting bad guys. And David Harbours sheriff doesn't do it for me. His character don't add up so to speak. There is something missing there. But these minor flaws are very minor.Stranger Things is defiantly some of the best TV I've seen for the last three years or so.",8
"I likely would not have enjoyed this series as much if not for the Duffer Brothers' choice to set it in the early 80s. It had every bit of the feel of an early Stephen King, produced by Steven Spielberg, directed by Joe Dante. There are some who feel that the subplot with the boys is reminiscent of The Goonies. I completely disagree. It felt like The Explorers (1985).The acting was solid. Ryder and Harbour carried the day, but Millie Bobby Brown, Finn Wolfhard, Gaten Matarazzo, and Caleb McLaughlin really did an incredible job. Young people should not be this talented! I can't wait to see them elsewhere.There were very few errors in setting (one minor error in the sound track). Even little details like the wicker back on the chairs pulled me back.The eerie feel of being in the woods and the electrical problems around town really contributed to a dark feeling. I didn't feel like this was horror, more like it was suspense.The one flaw in the show was the monster. Show-not-tell should have prevailed until the very last episode. Then a bit more imagination would have been warranted.I can't wait for a season 2, though I'd be more than happy with them leaving this plot and going elsewhere.",9
"Gotta say, I'm extremely surprised of the nose dive Stranger Things took after 3-4 good episodes.Not a fan of the Lost/Stephen King school of mystery crap where you don't have to explain anything. That's super lazy.I called out Lost after five episodes into season one. This after reading heaps of Stephen King books during the 80- 90's. Dean R Koontz is above King in my opinion (Read Twilight Eyes or Whispers). He always provides an explanation to his mysteries and they are always amazing. In hindsight, this show was a letdown.But the kid actors were amazing. Especially the toothless one. What a star! Writing and humour was excellent also. And that Carpeterish soundtrack, lovely...I feel Lando'd by this show.",5
"The new Netflix show 'Stranger Things' is pretty much exactly what it looks like: a very loving and painstakingly recreated tribute to 80s Spielberg films in particular, and just about every teen fantasy/horror movie from that decade in general, with a soundtrack to match.There's little original about it but in this instance that's not really the point - it's more about acknowledging the magic and wonder of the best of those movies and trying to specifically recreate that in a different century in a very devoted and respectful way.It probably falls sort of true greatness because of this indebtedness, but the fact of the matter is it's just very, very nice to sink into an 8-hour cut of E.T and Close Encounters, Poltergeist, Hellraiser, Stand By Me and, uh... The Goonies that never existed before.*EDIT* I have to add, though, that the second season is awful.",5
"If you're familiar with Stephan Spielberg's films, and find yourself enjoying them more times than not, then you really owe it to yourself to watch this series. Story: 9 The main plot revolves around finding a lost boy, Will, and a government experiment gone horribly wrong. This plot is extremely thrilling and sucks me into the screen every time the show is focused on it, however, the rather generic high school subplot that laces most of Nancy's story line lacks some creative ""umph"" if you will. But that's where the characters come in. Characters: 9 Stranger Things does an exemplary job of building a believable, well directed, well scripted main cast, yet, the side characters suffer from blandness. The three boys are phenomenally well written, it was a nostalgic rush of hanging out with my friends as a kid. Sound: 9 The techno beats underlying the tense scenes are gorgeous and give this series a unique musical identity. Visuals: 8 The sets were amazing, they appeared and felt exactly like an 80's town. The monster, however, is clearly not where most of the budget went. Overall: 9 You'll laugh, cry, and scream as you watch this cast suffer through and eventually triumph over a daunting mystery.",9
"Let's set The Twilight Zone, Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Maverick, Quantum Leap, Seinfeld, and Breaking Bad to one side a moment. These were shows that were great not only for their brilliant writing and production value but also for their originality. They either created, defined or redefined a genre. Stranger Things is another thing entirely. Another, completely NEW thing which is, in itself, original.But I doubt this will ignite an entire genre, and this is why I consider it unique and incomparable to traditionally groundbreaking shows. Stranger Things is retro. This is obvious and has been noted by everyone. But I don't know if many people have noticed the ASTONISHING attention to detail. Lots of shows are set in history. And lots of shows do a good job of it. But Stranger Things is perfect. It's perfect, not in that it is a perfect reflection of the 80s. It does a damn good job of that. But it goes several steps further. Stranger Things also captures the cinematic style of the 80s. And it does it with such acute accuracy that it is truly mind blowing for a writer and filmmaker who grew up on 80s cinema and was primarily influenced by it as a child. (Me).I'd like to take a moment to specifically note the props. When I was a boy in the 80s, that was the furniture we actually owned. It is perfect in every detail. The girl's room could have been my sister's room. My sister literally had that exact music box with the ballerina in it. Furthermore, the show draws attention to brands that were popular in the 80s. This adds a touch of authenticity. Sure. But what is so brilliant about this is that it's done in the kind of obvious way that 80s movies did it.I'd also like to address the brilliance of the casting. I realized something about attraction many years ago. There is traditional look, there are unique looks, and there are fashionable looks. In every major era of cinema, there are particular ""types"" that the industry, for whatever reason, tends to like to cast. The 80s had an extreme version of this. And almost everyone in this cast is straight out of 80s casting. (Winona Ryder is an exception. I actually love Winona Ryder, but I think casting her in this was a mistake). The daughter is a great example of this. She reminds me of the actress from The Great Outdoors Lucy Deakins (I just looked that up) and several other actresses from the era. I honestly don't understand how these filmmakers are getting these performances out of these actors. My guess (and this really is just a guess) is that much of this was casting. I think probably the actors they chose, not only were perfect because they fit the 80s look, but also because they fit the 80s style of acting. Much of acting is exploiting natural quirks in your real character, and my guess is that many of these actors all had a natural tendency to be this way. Tendencies that might not be particularly charming in a typical 2016 project, but that are perfect for this. The filmmakers may also have had them watch 80s performances to try to emulate. Either way, credit needs to be given to the filmmakers for this.But the writing is where it all begins. The foundation of it all. Here's why I'm so impressed with the writing. They didn't just include a lot of good 80s stuff, they included 80s clichés. And not even good clichés. They added clichés that are kind of lame like completely senseless character motivations that we're just supposed to buy because it's movie logic. This show really steeps itself in movie logic and I LOVE IT. I usually hate this but, in this case, it's a beautiful homage to 80s films. And what really works for me is that they do it with a real reverence. Any time they include movie logic, the do it with the same straight face as was done in the 80s. There is no tongue in cheek; it's a perfect mimeograph.There are so many little touches. Kids-on-bikes being a signature of 80s cinema, especially with Spielberg. A lot of this seems to be very Spielbergian, but there are so many 80s films that this project draws from that I wouldn't define the influence so narrowly. As a writer and filmmaker myself, I can't help but watch, jaw open, astonished and mesmerized by this project. It's truly incomparable to other films or television projects. It's something entirely new and different, and I think it will stand apart for a very long time. I've never seen this level of accuracy in the depiction of an era, and I lived through the era. And maybe that's why it's so compelling to me. The first 10 years of my life were 1980-1990 and, in many ways, those are the most important year of one's life. It's one's introduction to the world, to one's self, to sights and sounds and smells, music, food, entertainment, etc. I don't think about the 80s all that much. I didn't love it. But I can tell you, there are things about my childhood that I haven't thought about for years, that this show has drawn back into the forefront of my mind. Wonderful things. And something makes me think that, maybe, our world is a little more synthetic today. Somehow the world was more ""real"" back then. I don't tend to buy into this idea that everything was better before smartphones, but... maybe some things were better. I don't know. I suppose, love it or hate it, this show has made this viewer think about some things, and that's one of the most important things great art can do.",10
"So happy I found this. A great classic sci-fi horror with some great done directing! The story is coherent, not like in the many many series and movies that come out these days and it is just a testimony to the classics that we love so much, without simply coping it,but adding it's own style and flavor. And where did you found those kids - amazing acting, absolutely amazing. It is one of the strongest points of this show, the young actors who really bring it to life. I am amazed how well do they do their job to immerse you in this terrifying but also innocent world. Great job to everybody that work on this show and thanks for the good time! Expecting the next season :)Highly recommend to everyone who is a fan of the genre or just likes something that is really good!",10
"I like EVERYTHING about this show. Acting is great, character development, story, attention to details, pace. A mix of the best classics from Spielberg, King and Shyamalan. Being a kid of the 80s, I really enjoyed all the details, the score, the fonts, the obvious reference to classic films and music from that era. Creature CGI could have been better, but won't complain because the overall quality of this show is well over average.The only downside is that I've already went through all 8 episodes... It truly felt like an 8 hour movie, but I never got bored.Man I hope they make a second season.",10
"I am not a huge fan of science fiction, but I like this show. I am especially happy to see Winona Rider acting again. Fun, interesting, and a plot that keeps it's twists and turns going. The makers seem to have gone out of their way to find people who don't look like Hollywood. The kids are pretty good actors, too. Due to a few somewhat scary scenes, and kids using guns,I'd not recommend this for children under 10 or 11. I'm giving it a five for one reason and one reason only. The sound is so out of control I'm entirely annoyed by it. The sound on my remote goes from 1 to 100. At times, to hear the dialog, I have had to push it up to 96. Then when the music comes on, I find myself pushing it down to 75 or just turning on the mute button. Aggravating to say the least and really takes away from my enjoyment of the show. If it weren't for this, I'd being give it an 8.",5
"If you took equal parts Half Life video game, Super 8, and Bridge to Terabithia you'd end up with Stranger Things. It's not really got enough content to stretch over 8 episodes - would have made a much tidier 2 hour movie. The kids are exactly what you expect them to be and even the most jaded viewer knows Eleven won't be allowed to hang around at the end of the series - love this poignant and sweet can never be permitted! There was a nice nod to ET with the car chase and bicycles, though with a twist to allow for Eleven's emerging powers.Characters make confusing choices (Nancy) and the main villain is never much more than a one dimensional ""government man"". Parents are, as always in kid-focused movies, CLUELESS. The main problem I think is that the Duffer brothers said ""Here are our influences.."" and proceeded to script the series, instead of digging into themselves and coming up with something more original. It's exactly what I thought it would be from the trailer, but somehow I expected more. Good soundtrack though. Also, don't be put off by Winona's inclusion - even though she gets top billing in the credits she's not the main focus - thank God.",5
"This series is more than just a itch scratcher for 1980s nostalgia, it's an almost perfect re-imagination of a genre not replicated since the 1980s; movie Super 8 looks clumsy and is boring compared to this excellent series. The characters look 80s, the casting itself is very 1980s, nerdy kids and their nerdy friends with bad 80's hair. The language and style of acting is also very 80s but it's more of a streamlined 1980s, the editing, direction and cinematography, lighting is better than your typical 80's Goonies or even ET I think. I must emphasize that this is a grown up version of the 80s ET type genre, people get shot in the head etc and teenage kids rendezvous in the toilets to make out etc so it's not that innocent comedic thread that runs right the way through ET for example although there are many moments like that particularly with the main group of protagonist kids. I must say that the costumes, sets and the props (BMX bikes, giant walkie talkies, HAM radio kits, 80s circular telephone dials, 80s style houses in small town America, big 80s American cars etc go a long way to making this look authentic. What can I say, this is truly excellent and everyone involved should be proud of themselves. In some ways this is the ultimate love letter to Steven Spielberg, it's a labour of love and just doesn't it show it....",10
"Hope you have read the official storyline.One of the most beautiful things about this story is that it is set in the 80s. Its just like watching it 30 yrs back, not something that was made now and made to look old (I hope you get what I mean). Only difference (but really appreciated), is the beautiful HD (and no grainy crap too).The characters are so reminiscent of the Enid Blyton kids who solve mysteries - their true friendship, need to help and adventurous spirit, all make you truly fall in love with them. And into this comes in a beautiful girl (not talking about prettiness), for whom you really feel love and compassion. And then there are the teenagers and adults all of whom in their own way bring out the various feelings inside us.Basically its the characters that make this show great. The good storyline, pacing, editing, etc., give these characters a solid framework to take us on an adventure. And you don't have to wait each week, forgetting the story and loosing the touch. The entire thing was released together (8 episodes, 6 hrs), so we can finish the story at a go.The story itself is quite simple - Battling alien like monsters from an alternate universe. They could have easily done a 1.5 hr movie, but this longer version is nicer because it gave us a chance to meet these interesting people and spend a longer time with them. I was really sad to see it end. The way it ended, I think there could be a 2nd season. The ending was also a little sad, and I am hoping the 2nd season may have a solution.Quality is on par with Mr.Robot, Person of Interest, etc., so I can easily recommend it to you.Hope I could give you an idea about what to expect. Cheers...PS: It is so happy to see kids who don't have ipads. Kids who loved to use their imagination and who loved to cycle out in the open over long distances. I could feel their freedom and free spirit...............",9
"Most of you are aware of how Netflix works. When they premiere an original series you get the entire season all at once. Last Friday Netflix unleashed 'Stranger Things', a mystery Science Fiction/Horror set in the 1980's. The story opens with the disappearance of a young boy with devastating effect on his mother (Winona Ryder) and his three classmates. Many of the classic elements of films from the 80's era are presented here. There are older classmates, bullies all, with the exception a girl in their group, who becomes attracted to the missing boy's older brother, an outsider. This creates friction. Matthew Modine is lurking about sinisterly with a clear connection to a strange young girl who appears and becomes involved with our three young heroes. The town's Chief of Police becomes increasingly convinced that unnatural forces are behind the disappearance. Oh, yeah. There's an inter-dimensional monster on the loose to boot. Imagine, if you will, 'The Goonies' meets the 'X-Files' meets 'The Outer Limits'. So far, so good. A fun tribute to the horror films of the '80's. I just wished that I had kept in mind that most films of that genre sucked in the 80's. Because along came episode 8, the season finale, with the realization that I'd just wasted 8 hours of my life. The story implodes into a senseless mess. Plot lines introduced aren't just left dangling, they seem forgotten. Characters who seemed relevant are rendered otherwise. And don't look for questions raised to be answered. The creators, The Duffer Brothers (Make that the Doofus Brothers.) hope you'll stay subscribed to Netflix for season two. I had hoped that this would be a self-contained story, with season two venturing elsewhere, ala 'American Horror Story'. No such luck. There's just not enough depth here for me to waste any more of my time should it return. As a rule I'm quite capable of deleting garbage from my memory. Okay, I lied. I'm still scarred by last winter's reboot of 'The X-Files'. I'll add that Stephen King gave this a thumbs up. That should have served as a warning to me since I feel his integrity as an author has been lacking for some time ('Under the Dome', anyone?). I'd have given the series a score of 8/10 but the finale ruined it. 4/10",8
"I was very curious to see Winona Rider in a TV series. I was actually pleasantly surprised. She hit kind of a slump after Edward Scissorhands (a classic); she honestly pulled out with this series. I also really enjoy the character Eleven very much. She is a really strong actress. What is most impressive is her use of her voice. She has a sort of smooth, naïve tone; yet, there is a lot hidden depth in her. If her character is pursued in later seasons, in some sort of exposé, I would very well be pleased. The character development with the characters Steve, Nancy, and Jonathan is also brilliant. All three I very much hated near the beginning; however, by the end of the season, I found myself content with them. I see this especially with Nancy, who seems to be a much more solid, strong lady by the end of the season. I couldn't find any plot holes at all. I do feel a slight uneasiness because of slight abruptness of Barb's appearance. I would have liked to have her around longer. By and large, an excellent endeavor.",10
Basically this shows is pretty good besides the fact they copy every 80s TV cliché and movie from that time out there.from Alf ..Back to the future two ...lord of the rings to the hobbit cartoons and big props to poltergeist plus a little Freddy Krueger in it LOLnot kidding very addictive show I watched it in two days eight hours of my timethat because Netflix is doing a pretty good job these days surprisingly..with the fallout of Neflix stocks recently and the rate increases LOL JK JK,8
"I have been a TV show buff for a long time, but i've always been too lazy to write any reviews. As good as some of the stuff i've seen over the years was (e.g. Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, House of Cards, Firefly, Sopranos, etc.), nothing has ever compelled me to get off my idle butt and actually put into words how i feel about it. Well, at least until now. Because finally there is a something that is so absolutely, mindblowingly good, that it feels like i don't really have a choice but to try and tell the world about it.This show is something special. The storytelling, the cinematography, the acting (including the child actors), the pacing, the music, the 80's nostalgia and pop-culture references, even something as trivial as the opening credits and title screen... everything about this show screams perfection. I'm curious what Netflix will throw at us next. I don't expect they will be able to maintain this level of quality with their future productions, but even coming close to it every now and then would probably put them ahead of the competition, including HBO.In summary, i think Stranger Things is a masterpiece and pretty much the best TV production i've ever seen. If it was a movie, it would rank among my top 5 movies of all time, that's how good it is. If you haven't seen it yet, you owe it to yourself to watch it ASAP. You won't regret it :)",10
"OK I rated this a 4 only because I think it's getting way too high a rating so I wanted to balance it out. It's probably worth a 6 or 7 at most. But definitely not nearly a 10. There is a great deal of hysteria going on over this show and not a lot of actual critical thought. First of all, yes it's a cute story but it's extremely derivative (i.e. it's stealing all it's ideas from other places including but not limited to Asian sci fi horror flicks) and often trite & clunky. The dialogue is cheesy & stilted at times and some of the acting is appalling. In particular WINONA RYDER!! What has happened to her? She was unwatchable at times her over-acting was so irritating. Fortunately, tho I was tempted to quit watching half way through due to Ryder & some other actors terrible acting, I stuck with it and simply skipped over most of Winona's scenes. As it turned out this made no difference to the story line and made the whole viewing experience so much better. If you want to do the same thing you just have to be careful - there are a couple of important bits with her in them & they are watchable enough because her dialogue in them is limited. Anyway - I think it's a fun series to watch but try not to expect too much even tho the ridiculously high rating tempts you to do just that. Also watch out for Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven. Her performance alone is worth sticking with the show for. She is brilliant & manages to save the show from being pretty mediocre. Girl has a big future ahead of her.So anyway - do watch it! It's fun, has a nice 80's vibe & a cool 80's soundtrack (for the most part) but just don't get misled by the current hysterical popularity of the show. It's not as good as the ratings suggest, it's just enjoying a lot of buzz & hype, much like Pokemon Go. It's a shame really because my overly high expectations ruined it for me I think.",4
"The plot was interesting enough to finish the series but it was too often tedious and focused on adolescent drama that is better suited for the preteen crowd. I would rather have watched this in a denser and more focused 90 minute movie. I found myself wanting to fast forward many times, and I often did. There is a fine line between drama/suspense and just bad writing/clichés. This show often dances on that line. As far as the acting goes, I think everyone did a good job, but Winona wasn't a great fit for the role. Her celebrity made the show focus a little too much on her character at times and she came across annoyingly crazy for the first half of the series. She has a lot of energy and a very specific voice, maybe its just me, but while she is talented, I'm just not sure she was a good fit. Overall, I think it had a good plot, good actors, but the writing was off, and the directing tried to make up for it but didn't quite work. I don't understand all the rave reviews. Everyone I know watched the entire series, but as I said, most of us were on the fence between tedium and curiosity. Not as satisfying as it could have been. Definitely got the feeling they were struggling to stretch it out over 8 episodes.",5
"First time I logged in to write a review...but I HAD to. What an outstanding series....I hope there is more to come though I don't know if one could hit the mark like this again. As another said, a perfect blend of all that was great about movies from the 1980's. So if you are into that, this is going to be a series that you don't want to end. I always tend to re-watch movies from the 80's for the fantastic story telling that isn't in modern day cinema. Love, love, LOVE this! I keep saying out loud, ""Gahd who wrote this stuff...this is great."" I find it hard not to proceed on to the next episode, and at the same time don;t want to watch them too fast so that it is over.",10
"The setting, the characters, the actors, the background score, the story, the writing and the pacing everything is almost perfect. This is what a true thriller should be and NETFLIX keep doing the good work by green lighting such shows. Those 4 Kids are gems, we should be seeing more of them. Not a single moment across 8 episodes is boring. I binge watched all the episodes today. I mean I watched 8 episodes in 10 hrs I took 2 breaks in between like an hr each. Duffer brothers maintain the quality in 2nd season as well I am sure Netflix will soon give a green light to the next season. I wanted to give it a 9.3, since IMDb allows only whole number ratings and I didn't want to give it a 9 so I gave it a 10. Must watch.",10
"Usually, I'm not super excited about new shows on netflix when they pop up on there. But this one seemed alright, so I gave it a shot.And ohh my God was this a phenomenal show!I read a review that described this show as a mix between Steven King and Spielberg's works from the 80's and it totally feels that way.It is a mix of genres, drama, horror, mystery, sci-fi, supernatural thriller and so on. But knows what it is going for and what it is about, so it is more of a synergy than a hodgepodge of genres and tones.There's a certain metaphor that runs through the season with the kids that I found brilliant and comedic at times. It sort of tied the series and its events together, but I can't give any more details.The acting was superb, from the kids to the adults. No weak performances whatsoever. The direction was also excellent.This had real weight. You cared about the characters and their interactions and attachments with each other. You felt the drama. It wasn't just thrown at you trying to make you feel something like many dramas can do.What I found original was that there was three layers of main characters, each with their own part to play in the mystery. The adult main characters, the teenagers and the kids. And each with their own arcs in relation to the other characters in their level of age.I loved the synthesized soundtrack, that truly set the tone and setting.If I had to nitpick, I would say that the bullies were the standard antagonists to drive the plot and drama with the kids, but the actors in those roles still acted well and they were secondary characters.This is one show that truly deserves the hype and ratings it is getting.I don't know who these Duffer brothers are, but they may be destined for more.",10
The show is absolutely amazing it keeps you on edge as it goes i cant believe i just sat there for the hole season eyes watering and mouth open my god the suspense thank you Netflix and i hope you bring in season 2 because this show is rocking Its one of the best that i have seen in 2016 i recommend that you watch it no matter the age and don't be thrown off that its main's are children ... mind blowing.The creators have done an amazing job i recommend that more shows find originality and make you binge like so .The trailer shows things but just enough to make you see it(the show) to the full it does reveal some aspects like ESP but not nearly enough to even guess whats going on .Again congrats to the creators its marvelous a masterpiece Oscar!!- well deserved.,10
"This is one of the best shows I have watched. It stands on the tier of many great shows in the media today. I am not a huge fan of Sci-Fi films and shows, but this one was just absolutely amazing. It surpassed all of the expectations I had for it. Immediately when I hear aliens, I was nervous about beginning this show. Needless to say, I am glad I took a chance. The character development is fabulous. I became very connected with every character involved. The all around mood and setting is extremely cinematic! The score was great! I watched this with my mom who enjoyed the music a lot being that the music was from the 80s. It gave me a Super 8 vibe, the movie by J.J. Abrams. I really enjoyed that movie as well even though it was Sci-Fi, but I think this show is far better and I was very impressed with Super 8. I loved it! I strongly recommend this show for all ages! It had me on the edge of my seat until the final episode's credits rolled.",10
"This was an astonishing film.I was slowly captured and confidently wheeled in, and what a ride! It portraits an honorable homage to all the movies I loved watching when I was 10-13. Spielberg certainly comes to mind, but also some of Carpenters work, and dare I say Stephen King. The nod to Dungeons & Dragons is classy but also tone-setting.In spite of the many thrills during the series, it does not use CGI or scary-tricks a lot, which I think is very refreshing watching the current tendencies.The series works with values such as relationships between parents and children, best friends, and even a slight touch of romance. But, like in the eighties, the core value is friendship.Oh, and the soundscape is hypnotic!",10
"This is the second show I have ever felt compelled to rate however, it is the best series I have ever watched. The show is well written the characters have depth especially 11, and the show does one thing most shows fail to do now days they leave you wanting more.The casting is awesome every character adds to the show, and the main cast is top notch. Winona Rider delivers an award winning performance, but the best hands down is Millie Bobby Brown. I have never seen her before and it appears she is a newer actress but that kid delivers one of the strongest performances I have ever seen in a child actress. I also enjoyed Gaten Matarazzo as well. Although I did not mention the other kids honestly they were all great.",10
"I'm a fan of Stranger Things. Its yet another retro series but this one works for a whole variety of reasons where others have failed.First of all its well cast, with characters who have an 80's vibe. There's the stressed out working mother capably played by Winona Ryder complimented by a Goonies style group of kids who really fit their roles, right up to the 80's hairdo's and love of classically nerdy, Dungeons and Dragons.Its good stuff backed up by sound story lines that taps into a myriad of 80's films and television series with a sci fi, horror, conspiracy theory twist.All in all, there's a lot to like here and I hope as this series progresses, the nostalgia train rolls on offering more ""strange tales"" from the era of Ronald Regan, Thatcher and Pac Man. Eight out of ten from me.",8
"Now I know they have a lot of reviews about this Netflix original show but not many shows do I give a 10 stars too so I thought why not explain my admiration very quickly about this series. I'm 36 born 1980 so these kids were pretty much my age when this show was set which is a throwback 70's 80's horror mystery. Now it's not the terrifying slasher knife wielding or ghostly horror yet it does involve some creepy scenes with disgusting gooey dimensions and a monster. But it is all done masterfully and with perfect timing. now in a few of the early episodes I felt myself getting impatient wanting more but then I realized I needed to slow down and give the story a chance to unveil itself properly and it definitely does. I don't wanna give anything away because the acting of everyone in the series was superb the score gives you the eerie feeling without being corny the writing directing and filming I know will win awards and it's a series that will reel you in no matter what genre of movies your into because it has it all horror ,mystery,comedy,action and a touch of romance now I always ask myself why do I continue to keep my Netflix account with the repetitive movies and the delay in new arrivals but then I always remember I have about 10 shows I love and they are all Netflix originals and now ""Stranger Things"" is at the top of the list. Since this series is more like a long movie I don't know how long they can keep this up but I am rooting for this to be the first of many more to come.",10
"As some of you may know, when Netfilx produces a series each season is available to watch in full, at once, as opposed to episode by episode... I happen to prefer this method of delivery as it allows the viewer to complete a whole ""book in a series"" (for lack of a better analogy), in their own time rather than ""chapter by chapter"" at the behest of any given network... I find this especially helpful when a series reads more like a movie and follows the characters and how their relationships shape events... As opposed to a storyline that is strung together by a series of events within the same genre and where the main characters' lives only add a background element to the story (think CSI or Law & Order)... With that said, I was hooked after ""Chapter One"" and enthusiastically completed the first season within 24 hours!!When it comes to nostalgia, the 1980's are my favorite cinematic decade. So many great classics were created and produced by iconic filmmakers such as John Hughes, Steven Spielberg, James Cameron, Rob Reiner, Ridley Scott and Tim Burton, just to name a small few… And I have yet to see a remake or updated version of an '80s flick which has even come close to doing the original justice! However, there is something positive to be said about the rise of television shows in which the plots are being meticulously created and told within a relevant era from the past… I believe ""Stranger Things"" has done a stellar job of accomplishing just this feat.In this first season, the young cast does the show a great justice by drawing the viewer into a very relatable and memorable decade from our past. Through the use of various inspirations from '80s pop culture and by keeping true to the look and feel of this particular time period, the writers have created an impressive world for viewers to connect with and get sucked into! Without giving too much away and inadvertently spoiling this season for you, I'll simply describe ""Stranger Things"" as ""The Goonies"" meets ""E.T."" in a twisted, interdimensional game of Dungeons & Dragons (as if written by Steven King and directed by Spielberg)… This is, of course, my own personal take on the plot… So, I can't promise that you'll agree with my comparisons, but if anything you've read above has peaked your interest and/or you enjoy being warped to another time and place, then I definitely urge you to check this show out for yourself!",9
"Stranger Things seems to have come out of nowhere, I had never heard of it right up until they released the trailer last month. So if you didn't know, Stranger Things is a Netflix original series created by The Duffer Brothers and is set in 1983 Indiana where a young boy goes missing in a small town where strange things are happening and an unusual girl shows up.So right away, this setting is genius. I never lived in the 80s but after this I really feel as though I was there, they didn't bang you over the head with it shoving pop culture references at you every minute but just how they dressed, their hair, the posters on a bedroom wall, it all seemed so natural and not gimmicky at all. The movie Super 8 did this to a certain degree and I enjoy that movie but Stranger Things seemed to make it more real to me. What added to it especially was the music, from the opening credits to the score itself, the use of synth music worked excellently to bring you this mysterious, fascinating and yet nostalgic atmosphere; so all-in-all they really did well with the setting and time-period and will definitely be checking out the soundtrack, all of which served as a brilliant backdrop to the plot.As I said, a kid goes missing; it's something we've seen many times in television and film but because it is such an urgent, fearful, disturbing event you are instantly following the case because you want to know what has happened and you want to see him back; so from the very first episode I was hooked and I was staying. Now the series is only eight episodes and I think that's a good thing; a lot of American shows have upwards of twenty and sometimes that can lose momentum and become very episodic, which works depending on the nature of the series, but I do enjoy a lot of British shows where they usually have between six and thirteen episodes negating the need for fillers and can concentrate on a good script. Here the Duffer Brothers have crafted a simple but very well written story that feels more like a movie; each episode follows on instantly from the previous with no recaps or 'Next Time' trailers so if you were to watch Stranger Things, a binge is required. The also know when to show things and when to not, they spent their budget wisely and paid wonderful homage to the Hollywood of that time giving you visuals reminding you of things like The Goonies and E.T. These callbacks also never detract from the plot and fit the story well; also despite the 80s adventure inspiration, Stranger Things isn't necessarily for the Spielberg audience with one or two darker moments scattered here and there.Now I can't do this review without mentioning the cast. Winona Ryder and David Harbour are really well cast as the adult leads, from the desperate mother who still holds out faith to the driven police chief taking on mysterious government agents. The rest of the cast are largely unknown including the main kids but they were so talented. Millie Bobby Brown and Finn Wolfhard being highlights having to display complex emotions and intelligent arcs. I wish I could mention all of the cast because they were so good, from Joe Keery as high school jock Steve to even the teacher Mr Clarke, each person had a life and character you were invested in.In the end Stranger Things is a really well made original series with some of the best cast, music and writing I've seen in awhile that also has some surprisingly good humour that made laugh out loud. I really hope the series gains traction because I can see the cast and crew going places, as well as a possible season 2.",10
"The detailed re-construction of life in the 1980s is awesome. There are details like Dungeons and Dragons board games and even 80s wallpaper on each set.The children are fantastic actors and there are many throwback hints to the 80s in the whole show, such as even the introduction which is kind of 'Tron-esk'. There are posters that tribute films like Jaws and the Thing, plus news clips from the 80s, even embracing the 'commies' paranoia that was around at that time. It can be watched by children of today, but also by adults who grew up through the 80s who will appreciate it even more. Even though it is set in America, there was obviously an English adviser/crew member as even 'The Smiths' are mentioned and many other 80s throwback memories from life in the UK too. I really hope that there are more episodes, and that 'sea monkeys' and 'gob stoppers' are mentioned in future episodes, along with GI Joe, skateboards and fluorescent mis-matched socks. And don't forget 'Eagle Eyes action figures, where the parachute version resulted in throwing out an action man out the window, only to see the parachute tangle up and end up in a sad tangled mess on the ground lol. In all, an absolute happy tonic to the soul if you grew up through the 80s!",10
"I just finished watching ""Stranger Things"" on a two-day binge. I know, not hard for a series only 8 hours long... but who cares, right? I binge watched it. That meant it was good enough to keep my interest. If it weren't for needing to be up early this morning, I'd have finished it in ONE day.I noticed several negative reviews - on Netflix and on the web in general.Yes, this movie has a whole lot of familiar tropes in it. YES, it hearkens back to the days where everyone knew what ""The Shop"" was. It calls to mind everything from ""E.T. The Extra Terrestrial"", to ""It"", and even - in my eyes - to ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"".And - no - this isn't an alien movie. Not by my book, anyway. This is an all out thrill ride of fun-loving tropes that call us back to the days of slightly more wholesome but still just as terrifying (because many of us were still kids watching movies like ""Poltergeist"", some of us more sensitive than others to those scares or the more minor ones in family friendly movies like ""E.T."") as when we were young kids throwing popcorn into the air because we jumped so high.I know it sounds like something stupid, but those were moments of sincere ENJOYMENT for many of us 80's kids. This movie takes place in the 80's, calls to mind (very deliberately and straight to your face many times) that era... and still manages to keep a modern audience entertained. Now, I don't call for total originality in a story line. I am perfectly fine with the very familiar and been-done concepts that are common horror/fantasy/sci-fi tropes nowadays. As long as it isn't boringly so, I am able to be entertained by something I've seen before in one way or another.This is not quite that movie. It is filled with all those very familiar things ... but it manages to mix them up just right, and lacks many (if not all) of the cringe worthy dialogue and tropes that we know so well from overuse. And... it left it with plenty of closure that could mean trauma from the events in the series will always haunt the characters just as they hopefully will the audience - or that there will be more to come.Dear God... I know a season 2 will probably blow it... but let there be more to come!!!!!!",9
"When a young boy, Will, disappears things start to go wrong. A girl with superpowers appears and a whole crew of bad guys are trying to hunt her down. Who is she? Why are they hunting for her? But that's not all. A monster is there too. It is hunting... That's a bit of a synopsis of the story told in a very vague and short way, but I want to keep it interesting, so hey?The directing of ""Stranger Things"" was mostly done by the Duffer Brothers, as they are credited, AKA Matt Duffer and Ross Duffer. These two directed six episodes. They were really great. At first I didn't think that they could pull it of, directing with the two of them, but after seeing the pilot, I knew that they could. They made every shot look like a piece of art. But of course, this isn't only thanks to them, also thanks to the brilliant cinematographers. They were great at their job. There was only one shot that I think could've looked better and that was the one in the last episode where Hopper looks up with a bit of teary eyes. This shot just looked a bit of to me. I've praisen the Duffer Brothers, but they weren't my favorite directors of the show. This was Shawn Levy. He only directed two episodes, but he did them well. It was barely noticeable that there was a different director, but some of Levys camera movements were just fantastic. With this I don't mean that the Duffer Brothers didn't have some good camera movements. In the last three episodes they were also fantastic. The editing was handled masterfully, but with some flaws. Sometimes I could see a split-second of another shot, where-after the shot really changed. This I could see around two times in total. This doesn't take away the fact that the editing was great. There were some clever cuts in the second last and the last episode, switching between the perspective of Hopper and Wills mom and the kids. This was also very good, this kept you on the edge of your seat and both sides had different pacings which was very interesting. They were both tense full, but on another way. With the kids it was faster paced than with Hopper and Joyce.In contrast to the cgi. This was fine, but noticeable. Well, it was way better than some of the cgi I see in movies nowadays. I think that they could've made it more scary if they used props instead. I can understand why they didn't do that, though. For practical reasons. But let's not forget that this is still a TV-show - even though it looks like a movie most of the time and that's a compliment - and that it's common that TV-shows don't have great cgi. They did also use some great sets, the sets of the Upside Down world were good looking and had a 'scary' feel to them. The soundtrack was superb. I very much liked the songs, as you can see in the title of my review. I used a part that is song a lot in the movie. The songs fitted the theme quiet well.After this I usually discuss the actors, so let's stay in the trend, shall we? The series has a big cast, so I will select some people out of it. First of we have Winowa Ryder as Joyce or Wills mom. She was very good. She had some bad moments, but these flew away quickly. She showed of her emotional side throughout most of the show and at the end a more relaxed side. It was very cool to watch her switch between both. Mike was the leader of the group if I had to pick one. He was played by Finn Wolfhard. As a kid actor he was fantastic, so were the other kid actors (Millie Bobby Brown, Gaten Matarazzo, Caleb McLaughlin) I want to mention Millie in particular because she was the stand-out to me. She was really good. She played the character of Eleven. I also find it impressive that she shaved of her hair, that's very brave for such a young girl. Natalia Dyer played Nancy. She too was great. Charlie Heaton wasn't as good as everyone else, but was still good.The script is also very good. Not just the dialogue but the story and characters as well. Each character has depth or makes an arc, and you care about each single one of them, which makes the series only more tense. Weird hu, Hollywood, that when you care about characters the action scenes are more tense and better? Maybe you should try that for once. The character of Steve surprised me the most. He seemed like a douche, but thanks to fantastic writing I started to like him more and he also changed and became nicer. But the thing that I really want to mention is how quickly the show makes you care about someone. Only in the second episode (the second!) I already was near to crying when Jonathan hung up posters of his brother that he had made. His acting was fantastic at that moment and you could see the grief in his eyes, which is also something good. The ways they show how the people handle the loss of Will. How his mother becomes near insane and Jonathan suppresses. But all characters were great, I just named a few. They were interesting and fun to watch and evolve. The story was also interesting and kept you on the edge of your seat. It was complicated but that was its charm.In the end ""Stranger Things"" was fantastic. I am looking forward to next season. There was superb directing, acting and writing, with some of the best developed characters I've seen in a while.10/10",10
"SPOILERS BRUH -------------When this movie isn't beating it's story line over your head with a bat (4 of the 8 episodes are carbon copies of the kids riding bikes, the girl mashing things with her brain, and the kid communicating with his shrieking mother via electricity), it engages in a mountain of Fan Service, usurped only by this years Star Wars (worst of the 7 made so far, not even close).Much like other Netflix series Orange is the New Black and Love, you either have no care about the characters (the kid is kidnapped in the first scene. there's no connection), or you straight up dislike them.Garbage Level: Dumpster Fire",2
"I haven't seen it all yet, in fact I'm only up to S1 E4. But I can say this- One of the greatest horror stories that I ever read was Dean Koontz's The Door to December. This series so far is following a very similar story line, if not THE story line. Change a few characters around and a few scenes, it is almost the same. I always loved that book, and always wanted to see a movie made of it, and now there is one!Similarities: Weird young girl who was raised in a medical research facility and had no outside contact with the rest of the world. She has supernatural powers. She escaped and is on the run.She is befriended by other kids her age- in the book, she is being helped by her mother and a private investigator.There is an evil creature of some sort- in the book it is a dark shadow- in the movie it is some kind of humanoid figure with no face.The evil creature is killing people.I don't want to say any more just in case it is in fact following the book, because the ending was brilliant!I cant wait to see the end!",10
"I did enjoy this show, but as I'm watching it I noticed quite a few similarities to other movies/books/stories.The first and most obvious is to Poltergeist. Alternate dimension, oowey goowey portal to another dimension, monster in the dimension, kid locked in the house, you get the picture.Next, Steven King's Firestarter. Mother had government experiments done on her with drugs, child born with abilities, big bad government now after the child.Steven King's The Body. Four young friends.Even ET, a little bit.I think that's why they set it in 1983, because that was the height of all these classic tales.",8
"Stranger things was stranger than most of the shows I have watched, and I have watched quite a few of them. The show starts off as a tale of an abduction and melds the paranormal or supernatural to the mix elegantly. It slowly increases the dose of the mystic in time making it part of the show in a flawless manner. The best part of the show me were the kids, brave yet foolish and the laws of friendship they faithfully abide. Winona Ryder as Joyce was a master-stroke, she portrays the vulnerable and living mother with perfection. Each of the characters including the ever-encouraging biology teacher was crafted beautifully. One of my favorite moments if the show was where Joyce talks to El before trying to track will, it is undeniably exquisite. One can notice her love for Will and also the care she takes for a strange child who is trying to help her. One cannot deny the chemistry of the three little machos.All in all it was an awesome show , good script, good dialogues, epic acting and novelty. Hats-off to Duffer Brothers and waiting for season 2.",10
"Stranger Things is really very good, captures all the magic of the 80s and all the nostalgy, but missing something crucial, the music. The music of the 80s, A-ha, Mr. Mister, Cindy Looper, White Snake or something like that, at a certain time only is heard ""Africa"" and the series really came alive in the 80s. The series needs more music known of the 80s, just for this is not excellent.Stranger Things is really very good, captures all the magic of the 80s and all the nostalgy, but missing something crucial, the music.

"OF Watchers;ET ,Goonies,and a bunch of others. I liked the 80s nostalgia they did a good job there..It's refreshing to see a series/movie without everyone hammering away on their apple computer,or talking on their cell phones. A lot of people complain that they getting beaten over the head with the 80s nostalgia.Either they aren't from the 80s,or they missed the part, about it all taking place in the 80s.It's very E.T if E.T was written by Stephen King.Think The watchers, combined with E.T,in human form.The younger kids does and excellent job of portraying 80s kids behavior. Now they might not have it completely nailed,but close enough.Considering it decades before they were ever born. The older kids thought, they fall into the stereotype you often see in every teen movie.Either by bad directing,bad script,or a combination. So nothing really new or impressive there.Winona ryder was good as hysterical mom.She really looked like a mental patientWhat annoyed me the most with the series,was all the stuff that takes place in pitch black darkness, so you don't see a thing.And just have to guess what's going on, based on screams and grunting and shuffling. And don't get me started on all the flashbacks. Telling story in flashbacks,have become so popular these days. It's just a really lazy way of trying to progress the story, most of the times it doesn't work. They could have saved the flashback until the end,when they wrap it all up.All in all I give this 4 for the nostalgia",4
"I gave this a 10 because it really was scary. I do not recommend it for kids because of the content it portrays, behavioral wise, demon-wise and child abuse and animal abuse-wise. I am NOT a fan of Winona Ryder. As a matter of fact, I never watch anything she is in, but when I saw the trailer I decided to watch it anyway. I was very taken aback at how good she was in this. She is obviously more mature and not the dweeb she used to be. As far as kids watching this - it obviously seems to be directed towards the age group the kids are in the movie, but this will give them nightmares. It is a collage of many horror movies put together, including a rip off from my favorite SciFi of all time, Aliens, but still maintains some uniqueness. My favorite character in the movie was the cop, who actually followed up on leads instead of being the lazy, paycheck sucking up bum that he appeared to be in the beginning. OMG, that little girl, ""EL"" has a blood-curdling scream. They can do a lot more with this so I guess there will be a Season 2?",9
"""Stranger Things"" perfectly encapsulates everything I loved about my childhood cinema experiences. There have been plenty of contemporary films that have tried to capture the feel of the 80s and for a long time I didn't know if it was personal bias, lack of fresh ideas, or just a jadedness that comes with adulthood, but none of them ever managed to hit their mark with me. That is until now. I loved stranger things and am not embarrassed to say that I consumed the entire series in less than two days. Think of it as a healthy combination of the Goonies, Explorers, Fire Starter, and E.T. in all their adventurous wonder and you have a nostalgic concoction that works.",10
"There is no reason, in terms of story, for Stranger Things to take place in the '80s. But the '80s atmosphere - the dial phones, the chain smoking, Winona Ryder - are there to clue you in on the inspiration for this movie, which is pretty much every supernatural movie from the 80s with a focus on kids. E.T., Poltergeist, that sort of thing.The wondrous thing is how dead-on this tribute. It's not just the clothes and hair, but the style of acting, the scripting approach, the structure, all hold true to their inspiration. You've got the young nerdy kids, the horny, unsure teenagers, the monster, the mysterious one with the power, the bad science/government people, the conflicted investigator, the tearful mom.You could argue that this entire season is simply a pastiche made up of recycled elements, and I wouldn't disagree, but it really feels less like a copy and more like something of that era, as though the writers had fallen into a coma in 1985, woke up and got to working.While it doesn't have the high style of the Spielberg films that are a primary influence, it does have the likability. The story is consistently engaging and fun, the acting is excellent, and the movie has sufficient laughs and tears to satisfy.",9
"I was a skeptical about another attempt to revive the 80s but ""Stranger Things"" really succeeded in many ways. It has served as a very smart pastiche of many of the films I have watched and loved as a kid in the 80s and - the list is so huge to mention here - as well as homage to Stephen King's works, the most obvious one being It .It is very amusing to see that the authors got to recreate the atmosphere of the 80s and tell a great story that it is still is entertaining and smart and gets you hoping for the next episode.In a way, this is another wonderful work that pertains to the same niche of art of Guardians Of The Galaxy, when the walls disappear and you are completely immersed.",10
"I've now watched the first 4 or 5 eps of this new Netflix orig. mini- series (I think?), and, like the 2011 film ""Super 8"", this really put me in the mind of a lot of things that came out in the late '70s/early '80s, including some of Spielberg's concoctions. At it's heart, it's a missing child case (like ""E.T."" was about a boy dealing with divorce), but the bigger picture seems to involve a whole slew of things- secret government operatives, experimentation, monsters, possibly aliens-??- not sure about that so far, but wow this show keeps you on the edge of your seat!",8
"This is my first review here, if I remember correctly. I wanted to review this series because, well, I haven't watched anything I felt this way about in a long time, and positive reviews call the attention of other people that may watch it, making it be more popular and getting for sure a second season! I watched the full season, 2 episodes per day, and in my opinion the pace of the series was great. I didn't feel bored in any moment, what usually happens to me in most movies and series ( 2 hours can feel like such a long time!). As everyone mentions, if you've enjoyed the goonies, monster squad, ET and in general 80s movies with a little horror in them, you're gonna love this one. Don't expect any pretentious, artsy stuff; it's just fun, like old Spielberg movies, and it's great at being that. BTW, I've been a fan of tales from the crypt, masters of horror, the twilight zone, are you afraid of the dark, etc., what can also give you an idea of why I loved this series so much.",10
"This could have been amazing, could have been really memorable, but it just isn't. These TV series have done so many things right - good cast, good acting, great cinematography, great music, great storytelling, decent dialogues.The plot ruins everything. It's just so incredibly simple and straightforward, it pains me. There's no mystery, no plot twist, it's like riding on a train through a desert. You can predict how all of it is going to end from like episode 2 or 3.I expected so much more, considering how high rated these series are. They could have gone in so many different and interesting ways, but for some reason they chose the story that has been told a billion times. Experiments in a lab open a portal through which monsters come out is so 1980. Oh wait, was that your grand plan? Booooring.",5
"It's okay. We've seen similar premises with Firestarter, Scanners, Minority Report, etc. I binged watched and enjoyed..... however.....every time the three boys came on screen I cringed. Every single scene was them arguing, yelling at each other, shoving each other, insulting each other, over and over and over. No development beyond that. Like whoever wrote those scenes only knew about preteens from watching Goonies. Loved Wynona Ryder and the Police Chief guy. I did enjoy the retro 80s feel of the show. It actually seems like it was made in 1983 at times, and in a good way. Quite honestly if it hadn't been for the bickering kids and teen angst I would have give it 8 stars, but they bothered me that much. Hasn't matched the hype for me but obviously, I'm in the minority with that opinion.",6
"Only two episodes in and it's very apparent that a lot of love went into this show. The casting is blowing me away. The sets are incredible. Just awesomesauce everywhere.They have teens doing at least half of the acting and they come across as so authentic.Winona Ryder is the most recognizable face in Stranger and she is completely immersed in her role. Zero ego, she shines as a single 80s mom in an impossible situation. He emotional performance makes the story come alive.There is a nearly perfect blend of drama, horror, sci-fi, and all balanced by a fun sense of humor. The 80's nostalgia is strong. I hope they borrow a page from American Horror Story and come with different themes for many seasons to come.",10
"Without saying anything about the actual storyline, I can definitely say: WOW, a refreshing new series with an elegant retro feel! It takes you back to the 80's, totally believable. All the equipment, clothes and fashion, cars, music, buildings, etc. are so well chosen and gives the story such an authentic feel. The synthesizer theme song is awesome - it enhances the whole experience, killer! The acting is superb, this includes all ages - even the kids did an amazing job, their work didn't seem forced or faked, and they have amazing chemistry on screen! Great camera angles too.If you like mystery/sci-fi/thriller stories like the X-Files, American Horror story, Super 8, or ET, than this show (which has elements of all these) will surly not disappoint. In fact, I really had no expectations and was totally hooked by the end of the first episode! Looking very forward to the next season and am curious to see how they will develop the plot. I can only hope it doesn't become too predictable - that it still keeps me at the edge of my seat!",10
"Another drawn out never ending series...Everything about it is predictable.Where have the single episode jolting series gone?Having to invest hours upon hours to find out how a show ends(if ever) is getting very old.I've decided to pull the plug after the 2nd episode instead of losing interest halfway through the season like so many others of the same format.The word ""bindge"" in front of any word usually implies a negative thing and its no different with ""bindge watching""",3
"The series is perfect, holds the attention from start to finish. Each episode is well designed, intrigue and surprises the viewer, causing the desire to immediately begin the next stay latent. The script is something to admire, as it is not seen in most current series. Who watches sit within the story, and you can understand perfectly the lashings of the whole plot, despite the suspense is maintained with full logic to the facts presented. The actors give a show and perfectly fulfill the role of convincing the audience. Especially Winona Ryder (Joyce), wronged in the film industry, and dressed the mother of the character of the missing boy, is convincing in every scene, there is no way to excite and cheer for her. Also noteworthy young Millie Brown (Eleven), which surprises the best suspense scenes with his mysterious character. The soundtrack helps take us to the show room and was delicately chosen according to the time when the story takes place. The house opening track perfectly with the art and serves as an appetizer for what lie ahead.In general, the series surprised by the quality, because it is produced by a streaming service company, to escape the current tiresome theme of making remakes or show zombies, superheroes, vampires or police investigation, to bring a sense nostalgic big productions the years 80/90 for children's characters are so prominent in an adult series, and for various other reasons I could spend all day listing here, but invite those who did not attend have this experience, it is very pity brought me back to have interest in series again.",10
"This series is the power of Netflix at its finest! No need for 24 episodes, monster-of-the-week episodes, etc. Just 8 episodes of great storytelling, of a self-contained story, pretty much what anyone wants! Everything is great here, the pacing, the actors are FANTASTIC! the kids are darn impressive especially Eleven! Plus, the way it is filmed is beautiful, giving unusual shots you wouldn't usually see in a TV series. Great music! Yes it's an homage to the 80's cinematography (and music and games), but it's an original story in this world of remakes, sequels, etc. I hope this series is a great commercial success and will convince Netflix to keep going that way and giving unusual projects a shot. If you're a fan of sci-fi, fantasy, horror or the 80's or none of the above watch this! My brother is not in the least interested by any of that stuff, can't fathom what Dungeons & Dragons is about and was hooked on this series. Way to go Netflix",10
"Watching this TV series was like eating a beautiful looking plate of food and then puking your guts out.It started out great. Excellent retro feel and cinematography, promising premise and story line, and a wonderful cast. And then it all went to hell.Things moved along nicely out of the gate and then all of a sudden scenes became contrived and unbelievable. It then hit the wall and was just plain stupid in every way. I was actually screaming at the TV and also very upset for wasting my time in the first place.More specifically, the rapid-fire switching from scene to scene to I guess create more action was amateur hour. The insertion of slow and meaningless scenes to offer contrast to faster moving scenes was obvious, in a very bad way. They then throw in the constant flashbacks interrupting the flow in a most annoying manner. The only way I could get through it was by fast-forwarding through most of the scenes.In the end, the only audience that could possible appreciate this garbage would be kids under the age of 10. Such a waste too given the premise, cinematography and cast. The directors and producers should be ashamed because if this was done by competent people it could have been brilliant.",3
"Absolutely fantastic! Brilliant cast. The young child actors all deserve huge praise. One maybe a little more in Millie Brown. This is a talent you don't see often. Flawless would be an understatement. Winona Ryder shows her acting chops have only gotten better with age. Amen to the Duffer Brothers. The directing , writing, music and cinematography are all on the money. This show relates to all ages which is pretty rare to find these days. Stranger Things provides you with just enough laughter yet pulses on the horror/drama aspect to perfection. Now this is a way to bring back the 80s. Anybody who likes good television don't hesitate to order Netflix immediately. Besides you're already missing out on House of Cards & Bloodline.Z",9
"Stranger Things is a story about these kids/people who experience the great unknown. Except they seem to know awfully lot about it because convenience. In fact, the writing is so convenient that it often becomes annoying and destroys the immersion. People said Lucy was a bad movie because pseudo-science. Time to put some salt in my bathtub and enter the shadow world to make sure! After all, that's what the science teacher said and omg it twerks!! This is called asspullery.Originality wise this is nothing original. Execution nor the character are nothing special either. Stranger Things is a very typical title from the mystery genre, but it came out in a good time, especially for those who see their series on Netflix. Every series is now about politics, lawyers, superheroes or superhero lawyers who fight against politicians. Stranger Things is not fresh, but it is good change and might even seem original when comparing to our other titles. Some call it the nostalgia train, but I guess some people are getting those vibes from the new Ghostbusters too, so yeah.The characters can basically be put into two groups: ""kids who are too smart"" and ""adults who didn't listen."" We also have under-casted cop who acts too well, save- the-day Mary Sue alien and bad Fonzie who can't keep himself out from the screen. You can basically forget every one of them in a month and few years later wonder ""hmm where have I see this fella before?"" when they randomly get casted on a movie/series you end up watching. The baddies were also really shallow in this. One-dimensional to the max. I wonder if they could have covered it better in a movie.I am still not sure why exactly I liked the series despite all the mediocrity. I guess you could say it did good job capturing the atmosphere. But still it often end up ruining it with character flaws. The mystery seemed quite interesting after the start, so it did manage to take me with it. First 2 episodes were bad and the conclusion was meh. In fact, the conclusion was so unoriginal that it alone made me drop the score from 6/10 to 5/10.There is some nice songs in the OST. I end up listening them afterwards too. Well, the series is over now. Time to move on and leave it among the hundreds of other titles that were as entertaining.edit: update 11/11/17 - I have now finished S02 and it was a solid 8/10. My opinion on S01 hasn't changed.",5
"More than Spielberg, this show is closer to earlier Stephen King (""the Body"" and ""It"", to name but a few), in style and in spirit.Strange things are happening in the small town of Hawkins, Indiana. When a young boy disappears, a group of misfits, of young kids and teenagers, together with a paranoid mother and a Sheriff with a traumatic past, stumbled upon a government conspiracy involving psychic manipulation and experimental parallel worlds. And in the process of rescuing the vanished kid, sanity will be questioned, friendship tested, teenage angst overcame. In other words, all the elements of a 80s genre masterpiece were safely in place. Simple but likable.The sets and production design very accurately recreate the air of the 80s classics which the series clearly draw its inspiration from. Special mention must be made to the acting. Nostalgic without overly clichéd, the characters were all very well-written and portrayed, true to their 80s inspirations in an innocently unpretentious manner. Unlike other genre efforts to ride the nostalgia bandwagon which most often ending up parodying their sources, this series treats its inspirations as genuine and organic, rather than just a phony commemorative exercise.After a promising start, the story came to a satisfying conclusion after a 8-episodes season. As a standalone season with just a few loose ends to be tied up, this is an overall quality, sometimes amazing show which deserves to be seen and appreciated by the general audience.",10
"I really enjoyed this Netflix series. It did take watching thru the 4th episode to finally stop finding all the comparisons to previous movies and start telling an original story.Examples: Opening episode music/The Knick - Location/Twin Pines - Kids on Bikes/E.T. - Nerdy kids in club/Goonies - Backlight/every Spielberg movie - Main kid's little sister with blonde pigtails (even though the rest of the family has dark hair/E.T. - Finding strange thing that can elevate things/E.T - Strange things haircut/Minority Report - Strange thing put in water to get information/Minority report - Communicating thru lights/Close Encounters - mom who talks to the lights - log lady in Twin Peaks - kid's walking on railroad tracks/Stand By Me - missing kid communicating thru walkie talkie/Dark Skies.I know you can find comparisons in every movie, but this series had so many in the first few episode that turned into a game. That said, once it became an original story I really enjoyed it. The actors are all great. Usually not a Winona Ryder fan, but she really won me over in this role.",7
"I watched it all last weekend, yawning, strangely enough, or often waiting to hurry up and finish the damn thing. Stephen King highly recommended it, but it rips him and others off so thoroughly, that although it usually isn't downright boring, it certainly never thrills or sends a tingle down your spine with anything approaching cinematic ingenuity. Even the cinematography is dull. King also praised Wynona Ryder. What?? She spends the entire series squealing unsympathetically like a twiggy near-hag twit. The black kid, whose last name is McLaughlin (please give it back, kid), should never act again, and I found Matthew Modine's hair more disturbing than anything else in this silliness. Fun? If you don't like thrills, laughs, scares or surprises from your sci-fi horror, I guess. C-",5
". . .and not just because I miss the 80s. Here's a little town with a big secret - and potentially a big problem. And, of course, the government is involved. A cult is developing for the show at my workplace, and everyone has his/her own descriptors for what it reminds them of. It's like a mashup of Stephen King, John Carpenter,James Patterson, David Lynch, X-Files, and more than a soupcon of Twilight Zone. The acting is amazing, especially the children's, but Winona Ryder and David Harbour are fabulous as the adult leads. The 80s vibe is authentic. I only wish Roddy McDowell was still here and able to be in it. I have my fingers crossed all the way up to the elbows that AMC renews it for another season. If you like sci-fi or paranormal, you have to see this show. You will believe.Wow, IMDb, do you know how hard it is to write 10 lines that contain no spoilers? If I didn't reallllllly want to promote the show, I'd have just eased on down the line.",10
"Yet another good Netflix production. This is a 10 stars out of 10. After watching the first 30 minutes I was hooked. I ended up watching the first season in one stretch. This series is a mix of Dean Koontz and Stephen King set in the late 70s. If you like to be scared, do like I did and watch it at night in the dark. I jumped out of bed and turned on the lights a few times. Not really suitable for kids unless they are accustomed to watch scary movies. No profanity that I can remember and no nudity. One short love scene that shows less than some TV commercials. The story line and suspense will keep you on the edge of your seat. Looking forward to next season. Perhaps eleven will be back... It is certainly set-up that way. Good job Netflix!",10
"this is the best TV Series I ever watched. It gives you many feelings and I can't really explain in letters what feelings I got with the character eleven and the other 3 boys, my favorite is the toothless kid he's pretty smart and he's swearing really gives a funny yet perfect character to him and yes in the story it's in the 90's which my favorite part because everyone likes old school right? and how they used the 90's songs in the story really matches and gives a perfectness and much more I can't explain it in letters so you better just watch this :) and best part about movies and these kind of TV series is that it's fun because you can get feelings that you can't actually get usually. and it's like FightClub LetMeIn those kind of old movies gave me emotion and feelings and made me think and gave me many feelings. sorry for the many ""feeling"" sentence but you might understand me once you watch this TV series.-should I stay or should I go~ :)",9
"if there aren't so many holes.I enjoy this series, but not sure if I like it. So far I don't really want to re-watch any episode.The good side of this series is the acting and casting. Teenagers look like teenagers, not 20-ish supper models like in other series (""scream"" for example). And acting is simply great, not the ""reading from a book"" type.But there is not one single likable character, at least not in my opinions, which make it hard to follow the story.El is great, both character and actress. Only one thing that I didn't know she was a girl when she first showed up. She has an almost shaved head, her chest is flat and she's wearing hospital outfit. Her face doesn't look very feminine, it's kind of ""neutral""but in combination of hair style and clothing, people would have thought she was a boy. Yet everybody meets her instantly knows she's a girl.The boys acting is, again, great. But their dialogues are a bit too mature for their age. Sure kids can be serious, but not adult- serious. The writer needs to go to a school and watch how children play and communicate.The crazy mother is, well, a crazy mother who believes a flashing lamp is her son's signal, and yet doesn't believe he's dead. Normally in this case people will think of spirit, ghost...not another dimension, especially when they're living in the 80s. Why doesn't she believe her son is dead? Why does she believe he's trying to communicate with her in the first place, right the first time seeing the light flash? There should be more, like the silhouette of her son or something.The supposed to be lovely innocent good girl, like in all other horror series, is OK at first. Then turns to be just like the other hotties in other series: a walking flower with no brain so that the boys in the series have a reason to follow her and kneel at her feet. Everything she does is wrong, from forcing her friend to a party and then ignore her, to going to the wood alone with another guy when she already has a boyfriend...At least the hotties in other series are actually hotties. The fact that she isn't up to Hollywood beauty is what attracted me at first, I actually thought she and her boyfriend were a cute couple, but then they ruin her character.And yes the creepy boyfriend. He in fact is one of the more believable characters. But yet, he's creepy and is made to be hated. I couldn't like him.The weirdo she follows into the wood with also falls in this category. His character's behaviors make sense, but he's not a character to like, at least not now.Anyway, the first season of this series worth a shot, just don't expect too much.",5
"So much potential at the start. Romantic 80's well replicated with moody synth reminiscent of b-grade horror sci-fi. A well picked cast downtrodden heartfelt nerdy kids + others. Thing is, the dialogue, story telling and production quality began a rapid downward spiral. The end result was little more than color by numbers entertainment which I began to skip through to find the paranormal bits. Afterwards the series as a whole this left me an absent feeling wondering ""why?"" Did something happened which sap the passion out of the production. Some kind of derivative art vampire? The cause of the decline in production quality for me holds much more intrigue than the forced mystery this series suggests it is attempting to convey.",3
"I've finally decided to write my first review, because I think the reviews of Stranger Things need to be balanced a bit from someone who doesn't think it's way up there with all the 8, 9, 10 star reviews.Stranger Things opens just great. During the first half of the first episode I was really impressed by the look and feel of the show, and the story just brought me in. They nailed the 80'ies feeling quite well. The intro and music feels very authentic (although in shining HD). One of my favorite things was that they've toned the actors down to look less like movie stars, and more like ""regular"" people like you or I. The look of most 80'ies homages feel a lot less authentic than Stranger Things, where you feel that they've only just added enough of an 80'ies style to get away with it, but it still feels like everything's been modified enough to feel modern. Stranger Things avoids this and that's a very good thing.Now, for the story, I don't think it quite held up all the way through. I found myself losing interest after a few episodes. In my opinion, they gave away too much, too soon. The mystery disappears after a while, and over time the show started feeling more like a low-budget show. The direction of the show also felt somewhat all over the place. The story is told mostly through the eyes of kids, but there's enough violence and scary parts that I don't think kids are the target audience. Like, for example, The Walking Dead, it's violent and horror-y in a way that's toned down just enough to feel safe and PG and I found that quite distracting. I get a strong Super 8 vibe from this show, but it feels less consistent in what audience it's really trying to appeal to. Obviously, this show has turned out to appeal to most of you, so my opinion is probably not all that common, which is one of the reasons I felt I should write this review.The acting is decent most of the time. I don't think it'll win any awards or anything, but it doesn't distract, with a couple of exceptions. Winona Ryder feels surprisingly misplaced and I had expected a lot more from her. I didn't really like the acting of Charlie Heaton either, but I suppose it could have been a matter of directing as well. All of the characters are somewhat cliché, which I don't think is a problem. Actually, I think that's what they have been aiming for. This is a homage to 80'ies horror and I think it's a good choice that the characters are the typical characters you find in those old films.Got to mention again: the intro, wow! I love it. It's incredibly good looking and it sets a great mood immediately.I gave this a pretty average score, on the low side, because of two things. One: The script. It lost my interest over time. In the long run, it didn't keep the mystery that the opening episode promised going. Two: it was very unclear to me who this was aimed to appeal to. It feels very matinée in quite a few sequences, but I think the target audience is supposed to be adults.Anyway, I didn't hate it, and as I'm not one of those guys that raves about it or totally hates it, I tried to be a bit more nuanced in my review. But I'm very certain that I won't be seeing this again, and I think that in a year or so, this will be a show that I have pretty much forgotten about.",5
"Wow this brings me back. The Duffer Bro really nailed it with these series. Everything is extremely well thought out to make it a perfect 80's, Steven King experience. from the clothing to to the camera work, the build up of suspense and the music...aaahh the music. Loved it. Only minor downsides are the use of CG instead of maybe Stan Winstond's puppets and the fact it's in HD and not VHS quality ;) I'm definitely going to watch this again on a old tube if I can find one by the trash some where! Really looking forward to season 2! Oh and don't change anything for the next season please. Keep the style and everything intact.",10
"SpoilerI thought this was going to be an original Netflix series, however I watched the first three episodes and they are just stealing ideas from E.T., Starman, Poltergeist, and Carrie.Surely, there can be some more creative ideas out there, can't there?I was waiting for the Titanic II to sail and sink in Lake Michigan, ha ha. Maybe that happens later in the series.On the other hand, my wife loves it and continues to watch it.I also noticed that the writer changed in Episode 3, but it didn't change the stealing of ideas.",1
"Stranger Things are what television and movies used to be about. Imagination, fun, mystery, suspense, a dash of comedy. Before youth was force fed Marvel Comic adaptation after adaptation after reboot after remake after sequel, there was seriously good, quality material to sink your chops into.Thank goodness for Netflix because without them, ""Stranger Things"" would never have gotten made. I'm so glad it did. This was a tour de Force of filmmaking, with stellar performances by Winona Ryder, Millie Bobby Brown and a wonderfully eccentric cast of beloved misfits you embrace from the first episode. You will hear a lot of people compare it to classic 80's films The Goonies, but it's less like those films and more like what would have been created by the Masterful 80's filmmakers that created the flicks that became iconic.This series demonstrates with unapologetic glory what entertainment could be if we allowed more original content into our sphere, rather than the regurgitations and comic saturation that obliterated the blockbuster and dumbed it down to the IQ of a gnat. This is why we remember the 80's films so fondly. They were better.Star Wars was a film that changed the industry, much thanks to the young pioneer George Lucas. Following him through that gate of genius was Steven Spielberg, Robert Zemekis, Ron Howard and so many artists with stories to tell. The Duffer Brothers are a hugely welcome, long overdue addition to that club, and so is their series, ""Stranger things.""Packed with nods to yesteryear cinema, it never has to rely on sex, drugs and exploding cars to pull you in, but instead grips you with a brilliant storyline and powerful performances. It lets you have fun again, without beating you over the head with the common ""Look how much money we spent"" plague.I hope for a second series. There is no question, this is full of tomorrows biggest stars, especially Millie Bobby Brown whose turn here is mind blowing. Emmy should hand them their awards now.",10
"Stranger things starts off strong with its moody cinematography and nostalgic references to 1980 pop culture. After about the 5'th episode the story, acting, visuals kind of get bland. I also noticed an increasing amount of plot holes as if the writers were running out of ideas on how to tie it all together into 8 episodes, it just felt rushed near the end and really cheesy. I literally had to skip past several scenes because they were like nails on a chalk board (Spoiler Start *** where Mike was talking to El about how he wants her to live with him and his mom will be like her mom and they will be happy and yada yada, ignoring the fact that a disgusting demon monster with a venus flytrap for a head is in the room right next to them, then a few minutes later they continue on talking about ""after this is all over"", like umm hello? you are being stalked by a demon monster straight out of silent hill and you wanna talk about how she can eat ego waffles and other good food and sleep in her own bed. Way to sabotage your own scene by eliminating any remaining sense of suspense and horror. Spoiler End ***) I did enjoy the series for the most part and was mostly entertained so It deserves at least a 6/10, probably even 6.5. If season 2 carries on in the direction the first season was going then the the next thing heading into the upside down will be the positive ratings.",6
"""Stranger Things"" is quite an anomaly in today's overly saturated market of media crap and thin drama - and a good one. The 80s are for children what the early 60s were for young men, the ""decade du jour"" of all things good and valuable: friendship, character building, fantasy, adventure, learning the facts and pains of life without overprotective parents and eyes constantly gazing at iPhones. It was also the high point of the second golden age of cinema, when George Lucas and Spielberg were kings and the highly emotional rollercoasters fun films were the norm - and special effects were meant to dazzle and tell a fantastic story, and not distract us.It's a particular sentiment of comprehensible nostalgia that has been attempted to be ""captured"" and ""reproduced"" before by J.J. Abrahams: ""Super 8"" comes to mind again and again when seeing ""Stranger Things"". It's like watching a craftsman building a vintage car from scratch: it's the same thing, and at the same time, it is most certainly not. All of the elements are there, complete with slowly fading credits with film scratch marks, but it's impossible to avoid seeing the modern touches of editing, lightning, CGI, and the eventual winks to the audience that this is a period piece (which is particularly painful for those, including myself, who have lived in that era).""Stranger Things"" borrows from it all: apart from the obvious ""Super 8"", there's bits and pieces of ""ET"", ""The Thing"", ""The Goonies"", ""Fire Starter"", ""Akira"", and even some nuances of ""Neon Genesis Evangelion's"" Rei Ayanami on Eleven's speech and behavior. Sometimes it fails, being a ""paint by the numbers"" replication of those formulas, leaving plot holes and thin characterizations behind like a trail of bread crumbs leading you to what media produces today for the millennial audience unaccustomed with plot and emotion. On some times, it succeeds going beyond that level and portraying an engaging story that invites you to look beyond the clichés and enjoy this series for what it is.All in all, ""Stranger Things"" can be truly recommended, is a guilt pleasure of the most extraordinary kind, and rarely you will find a moment where, albeit flaws, you are not enjoying it.",6
"The constant presence of Carpenter's bloodthirsty monster, the Spielberg-esque children-vs-monsters-while-the-government-is-chasing- them story, and the 1980s vibe synth-pop are the base ingredients for this fun, gripping TV show. Nicely done characters in set of the 80s with synth-pop is already a good sign for a great show, top it with brilliant atmosphere, fantastic special effects and David Harbour (who does a really good job as the local chief officer) and you get the best show of the summer! I recommend it to everyone who loved 'The Goonies', 'The Thing', 'E.T.', and loved to play 'Half-Life'. You all going to enjoy this fantastic piece of web series!",10

"Stranger Things has got to be one of the most majestic and intriguing shows I have ever watched. After the first episode you'll be sucked into the small town of Hawkins in 1980s Indiana, where the atmosphere and overall scenery is impeccable.What blew me away the most was the acting, usually when I see child actors in a show I immediately think the quality of acting will be less than great but I was so wrong in this case. From the get go it is very obvious that these kids are insanely talented. Dustin is one of the most likable characters I've come across in a T.V. show or movie and Eleven is just....unbelievable.The plot is so rich and full of secrets, but it is not one of those shows that just continually leaves its viewers in the dark - you get flashbacks and all sorts of good stuff that bring the unknowns of the plot to life.This show is so good that it caused me to write this review and create an IMDb account AND I have a midterm in 4 hours!Do yourself a massive favour and watch Stranger Things ASAP.Patrick",10
"After two people from two different circles with vastly different viewing preferences recommended this show to me, I bumped it up a few slots on my To Watch List.... ... and promptly binge-watched the entire first season.What makes it so addictive:1. Great characters you can empathise with I have stopped watching many TV shows for lack of likable protagonists, but the ensemble in Stranger Things is interesting and well-rounded, yet the information on each character isn't divulged immediately. I felt like I was getting to know the characters better from episode to episode, and each minute sucked me deeper into this world. I couldn't stop because I wanted to know first and foremost how the characters' journeys would go on.2. Great child actors Because seriously, where did they find these kids?3. Slow-build mystery The show takes its time to unveil the mystery - and it manages to maintain a sense of suspense while doing so! At least for me :)4. The cinematography I was born in the 90s, so I can't judge how 'true' the 80s feel of this show was, but the visual of it was amazing. If you value cinematography porn, you'll definitely enjoy Stranger Things!Why I don't want to re-watch it immediately:The great thing about mysteries is not knowing what's going on or how it will end. While I was unable to stop watching the first time around, now that I've lived through it I don't feel the need to re-watch it. That's the only reason it didn't get ten stars (okay, that and the heteronormativity).",8
"It is one of those series, which starts with ""just enough"" steam to pique viewers' curiosity, slowly unfolding with details that fit in to explain the bits of the fast beginning.It is a great sci-fi watch for kids, adults alike; with good acting from lead roles (Hopper and Joyce), and a bunch of kids who happen to have a way of their own for solving problems in the adults' world.there's enough sci-fi, teenage crush, kids' silly lingo, monsters that we don't understand, telekinetic booyah moments in this show to keep you hooked through the series.I hope the next season develops more interesting facets to the seemingly already told story.",7
"I wholeheartedly believe this is one of the best TV shows in recent years - maybe even of the decade. Season 1 felt more like a long, drawn out, excellent movie than an ordinary series, and this can be attributed to many reasons.Visually, ""Stranger Things"" is stunning. The production value and cinematography are the best, unlike any other I'd ever seen in a TV show. Normally the contrast of visuals between a show and a movie is clearly apparent - usually because of budget and staff - but such is not the case here; one could play an episode marked as part of a movie and no one would be the wiser. There's also of course, the 80s homage feel that is conspicuously displayed in most of the scenes. To many, it serves as an item of nostalgia or a reminiscence of similar classic 80s movies.But even though 'the 80s feeling' seems to be the focus of many people when watching the show, I sense that they forget to look at the other aspects that makes ""Stranger Things"" great. One of those aspects is the characters. All of them play some part or role in the movie, and they all have profound personalities. As the story progresses each of the sets of characters make their own developments to solving the conflict, and the way they were able to eventually intertwine their efforts was a satisfying inclusion. Even the child actors were able to pull off very convincing and pretty strong characters.This is a show that can easily have you finding yourself suspend disbelief and feel the story come to life, despite the very otherworldly premise. It's funny how greatly it makes you long for a misadventure with your friends as kids. Overall, the way the sequence of events build up, the way the plot unravels to the impending climax, the way the mysteries keep you glued to the screen, the way the magical soundtrack takes you back in time and the way the experience finally comes to a powerful conclusion and wraps up in a fashion that very few TV shows can imitate, makes ""Stranger Things"" an evoking installment that perhaps only good movies are.",10
"I don't want to ruin the party but i guess people are not picky anymore. Not just movies, life in general. They just eat what is given to them. And they don't complain, they ask for more. I guess quality doesn't mean much anymore... ""Stranger Things"" is not the worst TV show. The general atmosphere and the cast are pretty good but it's one of those shows with the obvious and now tiring, Hollywood recipe ! Poor screenplay (story already seen a million times), good actors but poor dialogues (not well written at all), and Winona Ryder... Oh my god, she is just moaning and crying the entire show. I guess Stranger Things hits nostalgic people in the heart but come on, be honest, we are far from Spielberg, Zemeckis, Lucas... the worst is yet to come, as we're gonna get Season two ! Oh my God, you can sense they don't even know where they're going.",5
"Stranger Things is a mash up of Sci-Fi horror that feels fresh in the resulting tale. If you're wondering what it's like, very topically, it's like The X-Files without any UFOs told, largely, from a kid's point of view. The child actors in the story are all excellent and the adult interaction is there too. You'll be attached to the cast and there's even the requisite bad folks too, all in addition to a nasty monster. It's an out-there story much like Steven King meets John Carpenter so, in spite of it's crazy nature it has a good quality which propels it nicely.The kids here just nail it. That wide-eyed ""anything's possible"" ethos is front and center. They make it fun to watch this story because they're so natural and lovable. They meet an exceptional girl simply called ""11"" due to her nature of being a product of some strange government experimentation resulting in, for lack of any other term, superpowers. She's certainly been damaged in the process and after just one episode you won't be able to imagine this crucial role being better portrayed than by the young actress Millie Bobby Brown. She's incredible in her fragility and broken youth. The other youngsters are just as good and all deserve high accolades. Then there's the adults of whom David Harbour, the town police chief, builds an important bond with the viewer. In his own loss he's become a bit of a loose cannon mess. He's about to go too far in his life and job when the small Hawkins community suddenly goes him a few better. He's the first one to sense a sinister government is behind the high-strangeness making his character one the viewer will latch on to and fully get behind.I'd say a wild story like this could have easily gone off the rails, but it never does. The Duffer Brothers who wrote and guided it deserve much credit as I'm sure it wasn't easy finding the mix of young actors/actresses to properly pull it off. They nailed it all around. It feels like a quality big-budget movie instead of just another Sci-Fi mini-series. If you like both Steven King and The X-Files I would practically guarantee you'll find Stranger Things right to your liking. Even fleshed out at eight episodes it's definitely good enough to go another season if the writing and acting levels are sustained.",8
"When Netflix showed me the trailer for this series, I immediately knew I was going to like it. I absolutely adored the movie Super 8, and this felt like a nod to that with a few variations.Stranger Things did not disappoint. From the very beginning, we were sucked into it with a tense opening scene that set the stage for what sort of series this was going to be. We're introduced to the characters one by one, in a way that makes us understand that each of them is going to eventually play a role in the outworking of the plot. I initially thought that Hopper was going to be a character that I disliked, but that wasn't the case. He was human and flawed, and I loved how his backstory was revealed little by little, up until the last episode, when we saw the culmination of what made him into the man that he was. I thought Winona Ryder did brilliantly as a strained, anxious, just-a-little-shy-of-emotionally-unstable mother of a lost child. And all of the kids were phenomenal in their roles, but I especially appreciated Millie Bobby Brown's performance as El/Eleven. She didn't have much dialogue, and most of her acting was done with her body language, her eyes, and her facial expressions, and it was absolutely brilliant.There were jump scares, which are to be expected in any movie of the thriller/horror genre, but I felt like they were tastefully done. The series wasn't saturated with them, and there was always a nice, tense buildup to them. The scenes with the monster in them were always delightfully terrifying, even the ones where you couldn't quite see yet what it looked like. I also loved the idea of an ""Upside Down"", and I thought it was neatly executed.I'm really hoping we get a second season of this, because there are so many questions I have that I'm hoping are answered. In the last scene of the last episode, we see quite a few of these unsolved mysteries: Will still being infected with whatever held him hostage in the Upside Down, the truth of Eleven's whereabouts after she kills the monster (also where that monster came from and whether or not there are other monsters out there), what happens to the Hawkins Laboratory and how will they deal with the open doors to the Upside Down, whether or not Terry will ever find out about her daughter, and most importantly, will Nancy stay with Steve or will she go with Jonathan? :) The one thing I felt could have been done differently was Barbara. I felt she got a raw deal, and I wish they had made her survive her time in the Upside Down, too. Other than that, I thought it was a great series, and I will definitely be watching it again in the near future.",10
"The Goonies meets the X-Files with an 80s soundtrack. Love it! When I first saw the ratings for this movie, I didn't know what to expect. I can't remember the last time I saw a 9.2 for anything on IMDb. It's fair to say that I was slightly sceptical.I thought, anything with a 9.2 has to at least be worth a watch. I was not disappointed. Not only was it worth watching, but I now realise why it has a 9.2.My rating is 10 out of 10, simply because I have not seen a series in this genre that has been it's equal in the past 10 years. It really was that good. They knocked this one out of the park.Would I like to see a second series? Not really, I think it finished really well. I will however be waiting with great anticipation for the next project the Duffer Brothers take on.I also have to mention the actors and actresses involved in this project, especially the child actors, really terrific job. They really brought this to life and sucked you into the whole story.Extremely impressed and to anyone who is thinking of watching it, I would definitely suggest giving it a try.",10
"Alright Netflix, you really have to cool it with these original series. I mean, for the most part they've been exceptional…I've enjoyed most of Orange is the New Black, laughed out loud at Lady Dynamite and had my love of super hero fiction rejuvenated thanks to Daredevil and Jessica Jones, but I haven't fallen so heavily in love with a show like I have with Stranger Things in a really long time. This brief, eight episode sci-fi series had me glued to my television, begging for more at the end of each hour, and I am absolutely devastated that it's over. This series - seemingly out of nowhere - managed to do so many things so incredibly well that it was, quite honestly, staggering, and my only complaint is that it felt like it was over too soon. From the terrific acting to the truly engaging plot, Stranger Things not only stands out as maybe the best original content out of Netflix to date, but one of the best new series in quite some time.The crux of Stranger Things' narrative is the young Will Byres (Noah Schnapp) going missing in the small town of Hawkins. After his disappearance, locals in the town - namely the boy's mother, Joyce (Winona Ryder) and his three friends - begin to notice strange goings on. Electrical interferences, paranormal activity and shadowy government cover ups…that sort of thing. Over the course of the first few episodes, Will's friends meet a young government lab escapee who has been dubbed 'Eleven' (Millie Bobby Brown), El for short, who demonstrates some curious abilities. She can manipulate things with her mind, and is able to communicate with people between different dimensions. Being that she escaped from a government facility though, she is being hunted by a team of g-men and comes to rely on the group of boys, specifically Mike (Finn Wolfhard) for her safety.Of course this is just a broad overview of what is one of the most well thought out plots in a sci-fi series to date. Stranger Things goes places, and is paced incredibly well. There is exactly the right level of push and pull. Just as a question is answered, two more take its place. While this might sound tedious, it's all handled impeccably, and you never feel cheapened by the string of mystery leading you through the different characters' lives and interactions. Which is another area that Stranger Things excels.I never once stopped being impressed by the acting in Stranger Things. Winona Ryder is great as the frazzled mom going out of her mind with concern for her missing son, and David Harbour is outstanding as the towns police chief who sticks his nose where it doesn't belong, but the real stand out performances come from the four kids. Wolfhard, Brown, Matarazzo and Mclaughlin are talented beyond their years, and they positively steal the show. Wolfhard and Brown in particular work off each other undeniably well, and show more on-screen chemistry than actors ten years their senior. I could go on about the relationship between Mike and Eleven, but in the interest of remaining mostly spoiler-free, take my word for it, it's powerful, emotional, adorable and up there with some of the most stellar acting I've seen from anyone, regardless of age.From the get go, Stranger Things wears its influences on its sleeve. It's a love letter to shows like Twin Peaks and horror fiction like the writings of Steven King. The score is dripping with a synthesized sound reminiscent of the music of John Carpenter. There's even some nods to the audience in the form of posters for movies like Evil Dead adorning walls, or characters watching Carpenter's The Thing. It does so much to let the viewer know that it's aware of where it comes from, and that it's okay with that. It rather masterfully uses tropes that we're familiar with from these other series and films as jumping off points to create its own story and universe. Stranger Things is pieces of so many things without ever becoming too much of something else. It's so much of Steven Spielberg, Steven King, David Lynch, Freaks and Geeks, but it's more than the sum of its parts. It's a wonderfully acted trip descent into the world of government cover-ups. It's a truly believable and heartwarming friendship between kids that come from completely different worlds. It's an inter-dimensional horror series complete with terrifying creature design. More than that, it's a brilliant combination of the three, and one of the most thoroughly enjoyable experiences I've ever had watching a season of television start to finish. The second season has a lot to live up to, and the cynic in me has a hard time believing that lightning has a chance of striking twice, but hey, stranger things have happened.",10
"First problem i had with this show was why make it a period piece? I felt like it was trying to say to me THIS was how E.T. should have been done. Later i realized that it wasn't (necessarily) meant to compete with E.T., they just wanted to make a script that didn't have to allow for cell phones, car computers, etc. They should have been more careful with the script, tho'...too much modern-day slang kinda grated on me.Next problem i had was with the teenage sex scene. It just didn't really seem appropriate In a show where prepubescents were the stars, and presumably the audience.Next, the pacing felt odd to me, as did the character development, and the plot revelations.On the other hand, this show does have all the necessary elements for both fantasy and horror, and if nothing about it happens to bug you, you should enjoy it greatly.For me, however, Netflix original productions still need very good sci-fi and fantasy epics to complete their collection.Please don't think of this as a bad review; I'm spoiled, this is the golden age of shows...and a series i would have been wild over 10 years ago, is only slightly better than mediocre with the current levels of competition.",6
"Stranger Things is cool, but ultimately disappointing. Though I love 80's horror and sci-fi as much as the next weirdo, I feel like if you're going to invoke such a loud stylistic lexicon you need to bring something new to the table, something of your own to balance the appropriation and allusion.The first episode is intense, dense with promises of captivating plots to be revealed. All the 80's elements are there, and handled so well, I am giddy with anticipation—where will this show take me? The 80's horror vibe is so well captured I feel it can't be all there is; a show so fluent in this language must surely do something interesting with it. The rules and conventions of the genre are established in such a way as to convince me they will be played with or broken.Alas. This show is as by the book as they come. As the narrative unfolds, the horror I feel most is, first, a suspicion, which slowly blooms into realization—the 80's mashup pastiche angle is sort of all there is. Some of the characters are engaging, and there is some fine acting, sure, particularly from the young Millie Bobbie Brown, as well as David Harbour, and, at times, Winona Ryder, but it is not enough to save the greater whole; this show does not transcend the shadow cast by its titanic genealogy.In addition to heavy Stephen King, Steven Spielberg, and John Carpenter influences, other appropriated/allusive elements which deserve mention include: some watered-down Akira as the basis for Eleven's character/premise/backstory; an errant MK ULTRA namedrop; a sensory deprivation tank a la Altered States; shots (of Eleven in the ""upside down"") which look remarkably similar to some of those found in 2013's Under the Skin; a figure coming out of a wall as in the Frighteners... the list could probably go on.Some of these ideas and elements might have worked if they weren't so flagrantly underdeveloped.I was ready to like this show. I wanted to like it. I even tried to convince myself I liked it. People seem to enjoy it for the 80's throwbacks; I feel there is nothing else to it. Stranger Things invokes the style of the classics as if to count itself among them, but it plainly is not. I find it utterly forgettable.If you are interested in contemporary work made using this vocabulary, and want something which does more than rearrange existing pieces, I would recommend It Follows, a movie every bit as good as the classics of the genre it draws from.",6
"Netflix really bought an excellent product, it took me directly thirty years ago. Good soundtrack, nice photography. Dungeons and dragons was the first nostalgic memory. The show is full of good 80's references.I never heard the Duffer Brothers name, but this time they really did it. I liked your work pretty much. Winona Ryder and David Harbour were good... but the kids were awesome, Finn, Millie, Gaten and Caleb... Kudos!Goonies, Super 8, ET, all together. An nice adventure, with mystery, love and friendship that you must watch.I enjoyed it a lot. Can't wait for season 2.",9
"This show was the highest caliber production I've ever seen, the only show that could possibly come close in quality is Game of Thrones. Netfix have played an absolute blinder. It feels like a long Spielberg movie.Stranger things has a phenomenal cast, especially the child actors. Its the best Netflix original by a long way. Eleven and Hopper are the stand out characters for me, both of them are going to go very very far in their careers. Winona Ryder was as always top notch. The bond between the child actors was visible and reading up on it, the Duffer Brothers worked hard on them becoming friends before-hand, which adds to the over all effect. I thoroughly enjoyed every bit of this, its mind-blowingly good and the sound track is 10/10. WELL DONE NETFLIX. LOVE/LOVE/LOVE.",10
My first review you all. I promise I will get better. Stranger Things first season 8 episodes of pure dream like bliss. A series that deserves its high ratings. It brings back so many memories of similar contented movies from the past but still has you guessing. Netflix is producing some talented shows. The duffer brothers have some serious skills. The setting is perfect and all the cast play out well. I could only fault the series once as like all shows its not perfect but I do believe that's how movie and TV shows of the Eighties rolled. I could give you a list of movies that this show reminds me of. I think in all honesty if you have read a Steven King Novel or especially a Dean Koontz novel you will drift of in a dream like state and be hooked from the first episode. The only time you will be disappointed is when the end credits role at Episode 8 because you will be wanting more. The sights and sounds of a time past come back to life. Enjoy.,10
"This show is not horrible, but I feel it is an insult to every writer of every 80's hit movie or show of which this current series rips off and they are not being credited and paid for whatever success 'Stranger Things' might achieve.It's almost like the writers were smart enough to pick up on all the winning plot lines of 30 years ago, throw them in a bag and then stitch this story together and because it is playing to the nostalgia of every 80's kid, they are getting unwarranted standing ovations for their barely not plagiarized storytelling. Throw in some 80's stars a la Wynona Rider ( I keep waiting for Wynona *Poltergeist Diane* to tell her son *poltergiest Carolanne* to run to the light)and Matthew Modine to make the potion complete and everyone is under some strange love spell. It's the worst kind of Hollywood emotional blackmail.I was even looking forward to seeing Wynona in this but she's just OTT with the acting and now I wish she would join Drew Barrymore, Tom Cruise and Kevin Costner for some acting classes that would not only benefit them but possibly make our having to watch them bearable.It's goonies meets x-files meets poltergeist meets e.t. meets alien meets stand by me etc etc etcIt's unfortunate the writers could not have been more original with 'their' ideas.",5
"I can't thank a friend of mine enough for recommending ""Stranger Things"" on Netflix!! My life is richer for having seeing this gem of a series. It is perfection -- a real labor of love that pays homage to the Sci-fi, suspense, and horror genres that we all enjoyed from the '80s. The story line, writing, acting, characterizations, and score are brilliant beyond belief. And David Harbour (who played the minor, but memorable role of Randall Malone for Ang Lee in ""Brokeback Mountain"") is a revelation. I see him as the next Harrison Ford -- he certainly could play Ford's son (kind of sounds like him, too). Watch this if you haven't!!!",10
"One of the best series I've seen this year. Full of good adventures, the best of some 80 films. The series makes you remember why live one of your best moments with your group of friends. It makes part of experiences, danger and mystery that slowly resolved. Undoubtedly a series full of magic, which is here to stay and that many already expect its second season.Netflix series tells the story of four children immersed in a web of suspense and terror, complemented by monsters, parallel dimensions and many analog devices. The popularity of the series has grown exponentially since it was launched in mid-July, delighting audiences around the world. In Latin America it became an instant success and the young cast was immediately elevated to the rank of major Hollywood stars.",10
"This series ticked all the boxes for me, and I can't praise it (or creative geniuses that are the Duffer brothers) highly enough. It's like they took everything you love about movies, TV shows, and books from the 1980's, mashed them all together, added their own origin spin on things, and came up with perfection. The setting is late 1983, and everything from the clothing right down to the toys, feels as if you are really watching something filmed back then – well except the picture and sound are 2016 quality thank god! Genre wise, it's pretty much a mix of everything – sci-fi, horror, supernatural, mystery, fantasy, romance, drama, coming-of-age, and comedy, meaning there's something in there for everyone to enjoy. I wouldn't class it as a family series, but I think that if your kids can make it through the Harry Potter movies without being terrified, then this show would be about the same level of scariness.The acting is flawless, particularly from the young cast. Because of this you instantly grow to love (and care about what happens to) all the characters, from the moment they appear on screen. As a long term fan of Winona Ryder, I had no doubt that she'd be fantastic, and she didn't disappoint. Both the soundtrack (Peter Gabriel, Toto, Foreigner, New Order, and The Clash to name a few), as well as the original musical score (think John Carpenter's Halloween) composed by Kyle Dixon and Michael Stein are superb.Think I'll go and watch it again. 10/10.",10
"I had heard good things about it and decided to watch a few minutes of the first episode earlier this week. After 4 full episodes I decided to call it a night, yes it's that good.If I had to find negatives about it I'd have to say that there are a few minor science mistakes like when one of the kids is following his compass that he's mounted right on a walkie-talkie near the speaker that has a magnet on it. Other than that the acting was magnificent, specially by Millie Bobby Brown that deserves an Emmy for her role as Eleven. Seriously she is a prodigal child actor that I'm already looking forwards to seeing in other productions much like I'm looking forwards to seeing more of Jacob Tremblay.And then there's the soundtrack. Candy for the ears, not quite as good as the soundtrack from Turbo Kid (incredible) but not far off.",10
"Oh boy!!! What can I possibly say about this fantastic show that no one else already has. Murder, mystery, suspense, thriller, horror, comedy, action, drama, sci-fi etc all beautifully wrapped up in a perfect 80's theme. It is Christmas come early on Netflix with this show. Every character in this show is spot on, and the kids especially are fabulous. They are the real stars in the show, and the way they are portrayed epitomises everything that was brilliant about the 80's.You will want to root for them till the very end as they bring out the kid in you as well. The dialogues are really good and the suspense keeps you at the edge of your seats. I absolutely adore the theme music and the musical score throughout the show is spot on as well. This show is a must watch for absolutely everyone of all tastes, and it really deserves all the praise. Spread the word that stranger things are definitely happening.",10
"I loved Stranger Things to the core ! For a series with just 8 episodes and 1 season under the belt, this turned out to be a creepy, spine chilling yet compelling original series. The Duffer brothers who took the helm for Stranger things absolutely nailed it with their creative and self assured way of story telling. Every episode kept me on the edge and i simply could not muster myself to wait for the another day to finish it off.Winona Ryder, David Harbour and the five kids around whom the story revolved were all perfect for the role and the acting from their side was top notch! The casting team, the background score team and the special effects team, all did an amazing job. I chipped off 1 vote out of 10 for the slowness introduced into the story with the side story covering Natalia Dyer's character.I hope that whoever signs off these originals for Netflix gets a pay-raise soon. You simply cannot stumble upon Sense 8, Gotham, Daredevil, Master of None et all without having the sort of talent that he/she has.",9
"From the show's opening sequence, Stranger Things already showed promise. The chase in the Hawkins National Laboratory, the game of Dungeons & Dragons, and the disappearance of Will, showed to me that the show will have it's fun moments, but it can also turn dark and ominous & that's what it turned out to be throughout the series.The story revolves around a group of young friends, an unnerved mother, a fellow policeman and a mysterious young girl who are on a journey to find Will, who at first was presumed to be dead. However, when they realize his death was fake, they 'venture together through an alternate universe, fight an alien-like monster, and unravel the secrets of the government.The show does a great job with keeping a constant and smooth plot. After you finish an episode, it leaves you wanting more.Overall, I think this series is one of Netflix's greatest original shows. It's almost difficult to find any flaws. (9/10)(P.S, the intro theme is fantastic! it had an amazing 80's vibe.)",9
"Stranger Things follows a group of people within a small town who go looking for a young boy who has gone missing and ultimately realize that there's more to the mystery then they initially thought.Some of the mystery elements were pretty good, and I watched the first season because I was curious and mostly interested. It had it's moments of cool stuff, but that was maybe once every second episode.The show advertises itself as a horror, yet it fails to be scary. There was not a single moment at any point during season one did I feel even slightly unsettled or scared. It's more of a sci-mystery, but even then it's not that good. It lacks a substantial amount of originality, from the design of the monster to the presentation of the plot. Nothing about this show is special.Another thing is just the amount of flaws in the show. There were multiple points where I had several questions about how certain things happened. For example, at one point two characters are in the forest together. Let's call them 1 and 2 to avoid confusion. 1 finds something almost as soon as they get into the forest and calls out to 2, but he's nowhere in sight. So what, did 2 just sprint off in one direction? Did he put in earbuds and start listening to some heavy metal or something? Did he leave the forest? Then, 1 goes off somewhere on her own, 2 magically returns, not out of breath or anything (so he clearly didn't sprint off somewhere) and not wearing earbuds either, and he can suddenly hear 1 from a place totally opposite the forest. Again, no spoilers, but somehow 2 hears 1 from that place. And even if you try to argue that 2 has bad hearing, in an earlier episode he hears a scream loud and clear from the other side of that very same forest. It just doesn't make sense. Some of you will call this a nitpick, but it stood out so blatantly to me that I couldn't help but address it. And besides, I can only ignore so many nitpicks before it becomes a problem and I have to start docking points.The acting, please kill me, is awful. The children are horrendous. They're expressionless, character-less actors who have no talent. At one point two characters are arguing and one kid looks like he's about to fall asleep as he yells at the other character. That, or he's stoned out of his mind. Sure, he's underage, but that doesn't seem to stop kids. On top of that, Winona Ryder attempts to pull off the insane mother role, and it's clear that she's trying to be great, but she's not. I don't think Winona Ryder isn't talented, but she didn't pull off the performance she seemed to be trying to. Everyone else was pretty flat too, at least if they were important they were.The characters these actors portray are even worse. They're unbelievably flat and boring. Each one can easily be described in a single sentence.The show tries to make it look like it came out in the 80s, but its gets to be annoying with how hard it tries. It shoves all this 80s crap into every scene, and it feels like the Duffer Brothers are ramming all their 80s computers down our throats and movie posters up our butts. I think the conversation the Duffers had before the show was in their attic, surrounded by the stuff of their youth, and started like this: ""Hey bro, what should we do with all this stuff from the 80s?"" ""Let's make a TV show"" ""Oh yeah, that's a great idea. But how will we get someone to produce it?"" ""Oh, we can just get Netflix to do it. They'll eat up anything, so long as they can make a couple bucks. Quantity over quality, like they always say"" Furthermore, the 80s thing sacrifices a level of quality even. The first thing was a personal issue, not an actual flaw really. This is though. The CGI is awful. Painful even. Now I know, ""It's trying to look like it was made in the 80s"" but I don't care. The show proves that it knows what practical effects are, and whenever it decides to use those it looks great. But I can think of only a handful of times where it actually did that. So why didn't it use practical effects all the time? I don't know. It's stupid, though, that's for sure.And the writing, oh boy. It ranged from okay to awful to flat out not making sense. And what's funny is that I think some of the actors knew that, specifically the main child actor. His delivery was so bad sometimes I wondered if it was on purpose. Like he knew that the writing was awful and was pushing the limits as much as he could to see how poorly he could act without the director noticing. Just for fun, I guess.One more big flaw: the soundtrack. It switches between this repetitive, boring, and frankly annoying sound/noise and ill-suited songs. Seriously, none of the songs have any place in the show. At least not at the points they were used.Overall Stranger Things sucks. Yet like I said, it was, for the most part, good enough to keep me watching it until the end. Will I watch the other seasons if there are more? Not a chance. At gun point, maybe. But not of my own free will. I don't get why people love this show so much, but if you do then go right ahead. Obviously I'm either missing something or I'm just not as easily impressed as most people or something. I don't know, but I don't really care. In the end I would not recommend this show.",7
"Had a hard time sitting through the first episode and skipped through scenes in order to not bore myself to death and still see what the story is about.*next paragraphs contains mild spoilers*As a sci-fi adventure lover I gave this series a chance even though I loathe horror type stories. I do not enjoy it when they try to scare me with monsters which is probably the biggest reason why this show did not perk my interest. But it was not the only reason.The first scene I had to skip through was the two teenagers bickering about nonsense. The guy pushing the girl to spend time with him while she wanted to do schoolwork. How could such vain dialogue interest anyone? The second scene I had to skip through was the mother yelling hysterically at the cop while he was trying to type up the report. I don't enjoy looking at women yelling while waiting on the plot to progress but having to listen to it is just unbearable. How do people enjoy sitting through a scene like that for entertainment purposes?*end of spoiler part*I noticed many dialogues did not add any real value to the story line and were just inserted as scene fillers or standard, unoriginal character building.All in all most scenes were pretty standard story line protocol, not very creative and therefore just too predictable.",7
"SPOILERS GALOREI was predisposed to like this show. I wish Hollywood produced genre movies as good as the 80s classics, such as Aliens, The Terminator, The Lost Boys, you name it. I played D&D when I was younger. Midway through the first episode, I had high hopes.But the cracks started to form fairly quickly. I kept watching, hoping that it might get better. Eventually, I got to the point where I knew that it wouldn't, but I wanted to see how bad the ending was.Now come the spoilers. I can't really tell you how flawed this series is without getting to the final episode.There was not a single surprise. To say that this show was predictable was an understatement.The acting ranged from OK to awful. Winona Ryder's googly-eyed mania was painful to watch. The best actor in the show was the young girl who played Eleven. Her quiet expressions made some scenes more interesting to watch than they would have been otherwise.Some of the mysteries of the series never see resolution. For example, how did Will communicate through the lights? Especially if, when you're in the Upside Down, you can't perceive the world on the other side?The series was too long. At least a couple of episodes consisted mostly of people walking around, driving around, going here to there without the story advancing anywhere. A two-hour movie could have told this story.The monster wasn't that interesting. Better that we never saw it fully. Also, how does an apex predator survive in a lifeless world? Just wondering. Of course, when the series runs for several hours, you have time to ponder these questions.Here's another one: How did the bad guys' MAJESTIC 12 base operate in a completely undetected fashion? Did dozens of people live on the base, with no contact with the outside world, for years? Be that as it may, they were stunningly inept, to the point of hilarity.And the end really wasn't the end. The chief bad guy might not be dead. The monster might not be dead. Eleven isn't dead. The young boy who goes missing in the beginning is coughing up alien slugs, but doesn't tell his parents. No resolution of any plot point, in a cheap bid for another season. (Note to the writers: Why not just start another plot, as other series have done?)A big disappointment, from someone who was ready for something good.",2
"I immensely enjoyed some aspects of this show but other aspects really drug it down. For one, the sound quality is horrible. Some scenes I have to have the TV turned up all the way to even half understand what is being said but then suddenly and without warning everything gets much much louder. It was not a minor annoyance and gets this at least a full star lower rating. I suspect that they do this in an attempt to startle viewers, which is not acceptable considering I had to strain to hear some dialog. Another thing I did not like is the original music scoring, which came off like an '80s B movie soundtrack (think- the Halloween 3). I also found the fact that they could not get away from '90s through present scare tactics (scenes where they try to startle the viewer instead of doing something more subtle that might instill real fear in the viewers- this actually seems to be a lost art). I also feel that certain characters did things that were extremely unproductive in regards to successfully accomplishing anything. Over all I enjoyed this but am only giving it 5 stars because of how badly they messed up aspects that could have easily been fixed.",5
"I've been struggling to find a decent TV show that would hopefully keep my attention during the entire episode since The Walking Dead is on a lengthy hiatus(kaslfj!!!jdsak!!!). Anyway, I saw the trailer and thought it seemed promising. Turns out, I wasn't mistaken. The acting is excellent and more than believable. The child actors should be applauded and praised heavily. They are just amazing. It has a bit of everything: horror, suspense, thriller, supernatural and the things invaluable, such as: friendship, society, family. I haven't seen the whole season yet but I'm on it as I write. I just needed people to know that YES, it is worth it. Just try it. You've got nothing to lose, just gain.",10
"Glacially-paced show plays like 30-year-old Spielberg outtakes – without the fun and charm. Cliché characters and scenes right from Close Encounters, E.T., and Goonies. And Poltergeist too. A Jaws poster hanging in a kid's bedroom is a nod to the show's vintage roots – and a scene that follows soon after. (Come on down here and chum some of this sh**!) The premise has got more than a little of Stephen King's It.Every cliché in the book is here: the d**chebag boyfriend and idiot friends, the cute virginal girl who is coming of age and her geeky big-boned friend, the Goonies-like tweens and the bullies that persecute them, the creepy introvert, the slow sheriff who grew up in town, and the a**hole G-Men. It's deja vu all over again – in not a good way.Winona Ryder's shrill, hysterical, nicotine-addicted mom grates on my nerves like nails on a chalkboard.Millie Bobby Brown, who was so cute in Intruders, is going to be a huge star very soon.It's great to see Matthew Modine. When did he turn 90?Add a star if you like 80s hair styles and pop culture.",3
"This series was a great mixture of several genres done in a style similar to horror and sci-fi movies from the eighties. It didn't quite hook me right away, but because it was so talked about, I kept on going. I'm glad I finished it, because the payoff was worth it. I think every episode had at least one moment that made me think of E.T. I also thought it had a similar feel to an old show called Tales From The Darkside--strange things were going on, but it didn't quite cross completely into horror territory. My favorite characters were Eleven-- of course--and Dustin. The whole thing just made me want to ride my bike around my old neighborhood and play Dungeons and Dragons all night long. It was pretty special, and I didn't just enjoy it--I'm thankful for it.",7
"Never saw it coming.The first time I read the synopsis I was like ""who wants to watch some 80's style show with some kids and cheesy sci-fi nonsense""How wrong I was!I'm hooked.It's beautifully shot and paced, the kids are great, and story telling is compelling.Another winner from Netflix.I heard there will be Season 2, looking forward to it.The score is nice too - brings back some memories.Watch it!",10
"I've seen all the episodes of Daredevil, House of Cards, Master of None, Narcos, and several other of Netflix's brilliant shows. This is definitely the best one to date. It's scary from time to time, but it's still scarier than 99% of horror movies that come out in theaters these days. All of the actors--including the young kid actors and the adult actors--are brilliant and give outstanding performances. Literally each one of them could be nominated for an Emmy. The fact that they're all unknown actors (save for Winona Ryder) adds to the mysteriousness of the show, and their chemistry and dialogue is spot-on. There's nothing predictable about Stranger Things--each episode had something happen that I never would've predicted. Most shows have moments where you can pretty much guess what's going to happen at certain parts, but NEVER in this show. Once I started the first episode, I ended up binge- watching the rest of the season in one weekend, which is the shortest period of time it ever took me to watch a single show. Really looking forward to season 2!",10
"OK, so I never understood why people on IMDb or wherever else would need any detailed description of a movie before watching it. For me it was always - worthy or not worthy trying. So all I'm gonna say is: it's worthy. Worthy as hell. Just do yourself a favor and watch it. You won't regret it.But, as IMDb requires 10 lines of text for a review, I'll add it has unique value for people born before the era of smartphones and goddamned Pokemons. It's very nice to watch people living in a still analog world, in a moment when computers are just going to enter our lives. Not that I have anything against computers, I was born in 1979 and enjoyed Atari, Amiga and PC very much, but this show just takes you to your very childhood if you were born somewhere between 1970 and 1980.Once again - watch it.",10
"The cast? Amazing! Every single actor seem to be perfect in his/her role...you start wondering, are they acting or they really live it? The kids are all great in their acting with the leading girl being breathtaking. She expresses all kind of emotions without to even talk.The director did excellent job, everything is balanced, nothing is out of proportion, every scene is giving you all range of feelings and makes you attached to the characters.The story is simple and yet complicated, sci-fi and yet is touching every day human problems and behaviors....I just love it...I wish there is a second season!",10
"Love that show. Love the intro music. Very 1980's. It has suspense, a good story line, and a great cast. All the actors are credible and look like everyday people, which makes the show more real.I am not a big fan of shows when kids are the main characters, but "" stranger things "" really took me by surprise.The only flaw would be Mrs Wynona Ryder. A very mediocre actress, if you ask me, with a lot of dry cries for a mother who just lost her favorite son.Anyway, I am looking forward season 2. Thank you Netflix for those great shows.",8
"Location, Location, Location. Well if you are going to create a replica of an 80's movie going experience why not shoot in the exact same location as Spielberg shot E.T.? Does any one notice David's House? The Shed? The Search? It's not an homage it's a dead shot location of E.T. and I was wondering why it was so familiar? Perhaps because I've seen it before? Check out shots in David's bedroom, the closet, the bunk beds, the search with the flashlight, it is the same location and lighting for E.T. It's a replica, and the clothes have the same effort. The kids vest and bikes and other details if you know ET. Well done. No harm no foul, just wondering why it was familiar beyond the 80's?",9
"It inevitably seems a little silly to pile on the accolades for ""Stranger Things,"" Netflix's well-crafted long-form horror/mystery/adventure TV show, but I can't really help myself.It didn't take long after getting into the first episode to sense what seemed like ""Stranger Things"" main set of cues: JJ Abrams' well done homage to '70s-'80s era Steven Spielberg sci-fi/alien movies, ""Super 8.""There are a number of similarities between ""Stranger Things"" and ""Super 8"": A cluster of really tight male best friends; a central activity that they focus on (D&D vs. Movie-making), a small Midwestern town, a sheriff, a girl, and a vast government conspiracy that involves a supernatural monster.Stylistically they're also not that different, but where ""Super 8"" wasn't really allowed because of time constraints to expound as deeply on its thematic elements, ""Stranger Themes"" as kind of a long-form TV novel, has room to range on its big themes: the '80s, the supernatural, horror elements (though not overdone), and crazy government experiments and conspiracies gone awry. ""Stranger Things"" also focuses more tightly on the darker supernatural ""horror"" elements, but in a manner that is much softer than the ""torture porn""-type intensity of today's horror films (though intense horror films have been around since at least the '70s of course). If anything it seems comparatively tame.The first season story arc without giving too much away is about peeling away the onion, so to speak, of the real goings on of a secret government lab - yep - just outside of town. Matthew Modine plays a charismatic, shadowy central role as the lab's head. As the series moves along we learn more and more about the lab and what's really going on there. The disappearance of Will Byers - one of the members of this cluster of friends - in the first episode opens a series of questions that have to be answered throughout the story to find what - or who - happened to young Will.All the actors are quite good - young and old, but David Harbour as the small-town sheriff with a past Jim Hopper is certainly the best in terms of total characterization. Winona Ryder as the somewhat crazed and manic mother of Will and older brother Jonathan who loses her son to - no one really knows yet - is a good fit. Her voice and mannerisms work well for a mother that is on the frayed edges of sanity after losing her son to forces that seem too bizarre to reconcile with anything remotely resembling normal circumstances.The cast of young boys are all great, with the lispy friend Dustin played by Gaten Mattazaro as the most stand-out and lovable loyal live-and-die friend of the group. Millie Brown as the escaped lab patient ""Eleven"" is also fantastic in her own way and has very pure acting instincts. If she stays with it as a career, it should be a long one for such a young and precociously gifted actor.It's hard to talk about the strength of the story and general plot without giving too much away. Suffice it to say ""Stranger Things"" follows a fairly predictable plot, mixing together ample government conspiracies with darkly supernatural elements and, perhaps best of all, a monster from a creepy parallel universe temporarily attached to our present reality.The '80s synth intro and even neon-like lettering of the series title was a seductive draw for children of the '80s like me (well I was born in 1970 but obviously grew up in the '80s too). It seems clear the creators played on this bit of nostalgia without getting too heavy-handed about it - there's ample pop culture references throughout. Ultimately the story, direction, and characters shine and their ability to maintain a strong story line and focus that sucks you in from one episode to the next (yes, we binge-watched it in 2 sittings over 2 days) is typical of modern streaming TV series that I enjoy like ""Stranger Things,"" ""Longmire,"" and ""Bosch."" (among others).Like a good book, ""Stranger Things"" is hard to put down. If for some crazy reason you haven't seen it, you will certainly enjoy it.",10
"There are homages, and there are homages so committed that they become practically indistinguishable from the original works.""Stranger Things"" definitely belongs in the second category. The Netflix drama, which debuted last month, has won many praise for its success on a creepy throwback tale. Set in 1983, about missing children and extraordinary goings-on in an outwardly average small town. The setting and themes will be immediately familiar to anyone once besotted with that decade's master pop storytellers, Steven Spielberg and Stephen King — a cohort that clearly includes the series creators, the twin brothers Matt and Ross Duffer.Filled with a sense of wonder and awe from the cinematic era of the 1980s, Stranger Things delivers a surprisingly refreshing simple plot and storytelling, enriched by it's keen performances - mainly its child stars - and pacing, which contributes on the delivery of what will feel like an amazingly entertaining 8-hour movie.""Stranger Things"" reminds us of a time marked by a kind of no- strings escapism. And as it does so, we find ourselves yearning for it because the Duffers have made it so irresistibly appealing. There may be other equally great shows to watch this summer, but I guarantee you won't have more fun watching any of them than you will watching ""Stranger Things.""",10
"THIS SHOW IS AMAZING. There are so many amazing actors and actresses which all deliver Oscar worthy performances, combining that with the mind-blowing plot the writers have given us this is a must see. The characters are believable, and grounded in reality and yet when something Supernatural happens, they try to solve the mystery but the actors do it in such a way that you BELIEVE that this could be really happening. I really liked how they just tease you with the small bits and then at the end they just go and give you everything they have, which was just amazing.They made some very good casting choices and the kid actors were surprisingly possibly the best part of this.",10
"Netflixes original content of late I've personally found a little disappointing so was a little dubious about this series and wasn't really planning on watching it anytime soon, but yesterday couldn't find anything to watch so decided to give it a try with my expectations a little low,. After the first 20 minutes I was hooked and done something I rarely do and binged my way through the whole series.It's not without its flaws, the characters from the government provably the biggest as they all seem very flat and under developed, CGI is a little ropey at times and a few actors on occasion go a little soapy with their acting. But all of this can be forgiven for how genuinely brilliant the show is. It's taken everything what was wonderful about 80's family adventure flicks and rolled it into one.Winona Ryder, Natalia Dyer and all the child actors for me steal the whole show, the soundtrack and score were top notch, but what really impressed me was through all 8 episodes there was no filler scenes every single minute of the show added to the story or character development.Truly top notch and if it doesn't go on to win awards it would be a travesty.",9
"It is set in 1983 Indiana, where a young boy vanishes into thin air. As friends, family and local police search for answers, they are drawn into an extraordinary mystery involving top-secret government experiments, terrifying supernatural forces and one very strange little girl.The Duffer Brothers have done an amazing job of combining the differing tones of Mystery,sci-fi , super natural elements,friendship,family,comedy,horror.It keeps you on the edge of the seat throughout the show.It creates an environment from the first scene which helps viewer to involve in the narration. There may be other equally great shows to watch , but I guarantee you won't have more fun watching any of them than you will watching Stranger Things.",9
"Let's get it out of the way: yes, it's not perfect. There are some special effects that don't look so special. Few details here and there, for sure. Original? Not quite. But this is a 10. It cannot be less than a 10.First of all, it's pure nostalgia. The bikes, the clothes, the music, the board games; the vibe of that era is all there. Make no mistake, the main character of this series is not 011 – it's the 80's.The casting is stellar – everyone, but specially 011, shine on screen. The direction, the photography, the pace – everything just works. And nothing feels like filler.It takes something special to have Stephen King and Guillermo del Toro praise it. Believe us; it is.By the time of this writing, Netflix is yet to confirm S2. Even if it doesn't come, this was a breath of fresh air to television (it's not really television, but you know what I mean.)",7
"Stranger Things Episode 1No spoilers, since the title is The Vanishing of Will Byers. So a kid goes missing, and this whole town is searching for him. Stranger things are happening all around and no one is mentioning it.To best describe this show is to mash up The Goonies meets Akira. At least that's the vibe I'm getting so far, one episode in. The writing and direction in this Netflix show is so much better than the Duffer brother's other work: namely Wayward Pines. Though now, I have Hidden on my queue so that I can see a better example of their work.Joyce, Byers, played by Winona Ryder is the first listed on the cast, but from the first episode she was over-acting. I know a mom is suppose to be hysterical when a child goes missing, but her performance wasn't believable. Hopefully in the later episodes she does better. Maybe my expectations out of Ryder are too high.David Horbour plays Jim Hopper, you might remember him from Black Mass, but really he plays minor roles. He's a bit hit or miss when it comes to his performance in the first episode. He has some great strides but acting is a marathon.The kids in this show are perfect. There isn't anything wrong with their acting or delivery. They feel real even if it's set over 40 years ago. Their child performance is on par with The Goonies, Harry Potter, Stand by Me, or ET. The teenagers on the other hand are worse. I mean annoyingly worse. You're gonna be bored or exhausted watching their subplot.Verdit: Worth watching more episodes. Between the story and acting I will be finishing the first season.",8
"If you're like me, who doesn't enjoy watching horror movies or series and doesn't want to have sleepless nights, this might be the perfect mix for you!""Stranger Things"" really does something special: Yes it scares you and sometimes even shocks you, but it doesn't try to lure you into a trap and then bite your head off.I'm on IMDb since 15 years and this is my first review, because I really had some kind unique experience. I actually feel like somebody cared for me while watching. Why? Because when I got scared, there were some nice or funny scenes afterwards to cheer me up again. It's like a roller-coaster: You can relax on the easy parts and you will get thrilled on the way down. There might be parts that you would have liked a bit different. But in the end you'll get out with a smile and want to ride again.What really made the difference for me: I could fully engage with what was happening and that's what I'm normally not doing when things get scary. ""Stranger Things"" delivered the perfect amount of thrill to keep me on my toes, but it also gave me enough room to relax and think. It is trustworthy and honest.Why 9 out of 10? Some things around the main plot were a bit illogical for me. And some cuts were odd. Normally, I don't pay attention to things like that. But there were some scenes, where the cuts were obviously off (different facial expression in camera scenes, different postures in different scenes).But both points didn't spoil the great experience. If you think that you might be a bit like me, go for it! You won't regret it.",9
"Stranger Things is Netflix's latest original series to hit the network. From everything I've seen that has the Netflix stamp on it, I'm yet to be disappointed. With that and great reviews of this series, I was really excited to finally get into Stranger Things and check it out for myself.Like most Netflix series, they are designed to be binged, and Stranger Things is no different. This 8 episode series plays like a movie. While it has no reflection of the quality of the show itself, I think it's a massive credit to the writers and directors to make this seamless series feel like an 8 hour movie. Unfortunately I was unable to watch it all back to back, with the longest session being the final 4 episodes. However with it only being 8 episodes, this is a series you can easily re-watch in the space of a day. And for me, this is one I'm going to watch this one a few times over.Stranger Things is at the heart a mystery/thriller/horror series. Plot wise, when I was watching it I thought it had an Insidious feel. Without going deep into plot points, if your a fan of the Insidious franchise than you will be completely onboard with the plot line in this series. The whole time you are watching it you are trying to work out what is actually going on. I went into this series completely blind from trailers and synopsis so everything to me was a big mystery. I know at this point it may have been hard to skip all this stuff but I you can, I heavily suggest you go in as blind as you possible can.Again without giving too much away, I thought the main cast were fantastic. I thought everyone nailed their role that all played into the final bigger picture. Everyone from Winona Ryder as the mother, David Harbour as the chef and Matthew Modine as a mystery scientist. For me though, a big credit to the child actors throughout this series, especially Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven. I thought she played the mysterious role better than anyone else in the series. What made her performance so great was that for the most part, she didn't say much, but when she did, she spoke it with a sense of naivety and unawareness that her character is portrayed as. On a side note Dustin was by far my favourite character. For the most part he was the comedic relief of all the tense sense and I thought Gaten Matarazzo handled the role perfectly.For many people, the biggest appeal of this series is the 80s feel. Even though I was born in the 90s, watching this series heavily reminded me of the feel I got as a kid when I watched those 80s movies such as ET. From what I've heard from people who had their childhood based in the 80s, the way the child cast is portrayed as they typical 80s kids is spot on. For me personally I saw the connection between the kids in Stranger Things and those in ET. On a side note, my favourite thing they did to set the tone of the 80s was the opening credits. Everything from the font to the music felt completely 80s. I'm not sure if the opening credits was filmed on film but the way the text never say flush and the white flickers that is typical in film really set the tone of what the series would be.Stranger Things is one of those rare series that once you sink you teeth into it, your hooked. I thought it was a great all round story that had a big sense of start, middle, end that we typically find in movies. It's really hard to pin point anything specifically that I didn't like about this series apart from not being able to watch it all in one day and not growing up in the 80s to allow me to completely relate to the nostalgia and characters of the series. I think if I grew up in the 80s this would of been a home run but because I at times struggled with that connection, it feel a bit short.9/10",9
"I do not understand the hype with this show. Perfect material for a teenage night get-together to watch some cheap horror. The acting is terrible - especially that Nancy girl - every time she comes up I just cringe. The story-line is ridiculously slow and juvenile themed. If you are a high school-er or younger this might be acceptable entertainment, as I see the target viewing market for this a crowd between 12 and 18 years of age maximum. There is not much depth on the adult characters and their interaction - even Winona is only seen screaming and not much else is explored about her persona. It would have been nice to have seen more scenes with the kids parents, or more filming inside the police station...adult interaction in general. Stay away from this, do not believe the hype. I just wasted a few hours I will never get back.",4
"My wife and I watched this on Netflix streaming over 4 different viewing sessions, one or two episodes each time. Overall it is very entertaining although I don't share the lofty (9.2) IMDb rating.Set in the 1980s it appears to be inspired by ""The Montauk Project: Experiments in Time"" by Preston B. Nichols and Peter Moon, regarding supposed time travel experiments at the Montauk Air Force Base at the eastern tip of Long Island as part of the Montauk Project. A ""time tunnel"" was created and alien monsters traveled through it to menace the locals.Here Winona Ryder is Joyce Byers, single mother of two sons, one about 17 and the other about 11. A strange girl (Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven) shows up and the 4 young boys who are close friends take her in and hide her. It is clear that she is different and we find she has escaped from the top-secret experimental lab. She also has extra-normal powers.David Harbour is good as the local police chief Jim Hopper. He is instrumental in helping uncover all the secret activity and find Joyce's missing son.The movie contains lots of paranormal activity. When her son goes missing, we find into what they referred to as the ""upside down world"", Joyce is able to communicate with him through light flickers, even though she doesn't know where he is. he is actually very close to her but they can't see or hear each other directly.The ending sets it up for a continuation.Update September 2019: We dropped our Netflix subscription, I object to the heavy emphasis they put on what I consider ""trashy"" programming. So I was able to get season #2 on BluRay from my local library. My wife and I watched the first 3 episode and just weren't motivated to keep watching more. Not that it isn't good, for the right audience, we just no longer felt it was worth our attention and time, compared to all the other things we might want to watch. To us there was neither an interesting storyline or interesting characters to draw us in.",7
"When it comes down to 'Stranger Things' I'm in a bit of a conundrum. Never before has a show managed to hit all elements of what people value as entertainment. This TV Show has humor, it has horror, it has mystery, it has one hell of a soundtrack, it has many moments of nostalgia, it has amazing acting (especially from the younger cast which is a nice change), it has amazing visuals, it has sad moments as well as shocking ones -but most of all it has heart. There is a theme of love that's evident across the shows run, whether it's the persistent love Joyce Byers has for her son that allows her to keep on searching for him against all odds or the love of friendship that causes our three protagonists to put themselves in danger in order to be reunited with their friend. The last scene says it all but also the connection and the undefinable love between Mike and Eleven.Also, credit to the writers for creating such interesting characters. Each one felt they had deserved their screen time. Hopper again is brilliant as we never really know his motives but we again root for his happiness. Nancy's story-line felt too separate at the start but it really blended in well with the story and gave the viewers a taste of adolescent life during the 80s. It was nice to see such empowering female leads – each one felt strong and determined but no more than the real highlight of the show, Eleven. The character of Eleven is probably one of the smartest moves Netflix has ever done. They have managed to make one of the most complex characters on television with barely any dialogue. There is constant empathy felt for Eleven. You can tell from her expression that her childhood had been stripped from her life. She is separate from the world but we still manage to connect with her in an emotional way. Like ET, there innocence and circumstance leads us to worry and care about them as time goes on. The last part of the show is one of the most heart-breaking moments of television I've seen – but it all highlights one of the shows prominent themes – love. Also if Millie Brown isn't nominated for an Emmy alongside Winona, I'll lose my faith in the awards system. Age shouldn't be a hinder and if anything she has shown it shouldn't be correlated with skill – putting to shame many of Hollywood's actors.This show is weird, but in a unique way. It would be hard to compare a show like this to that of 'Game of Thrones' or 'Breaking Bad'. It is very much its own thing, taken the styles of some of the best 80s movies to create one golden piece of entertainment. Get ready to experience many different types of emotions within 6 hours.I do hope there is another season however, even if there isn't – this show is worthy to stand on just this one for repeated viewings. I hope this will be a classic for newer generations so they can experience the emotions and feelings found uniquely within the 80s. But I've taken up too much of your time already – just go and watch it.",9
"...And now it happened.(I need 10 lines of text to be able to post this review but I have nothing to add.)It's magical, adventurous, never boring. The kids' acting (all of them) is out of this world. Just like the story, the atmosphere, everything.Stranger Things feels like one movie, and still it's too short. An endless story would be exactly right. Every episode my man and I were glued to the screen, almost sucked in.I love how nothing they came up with is too much. Could have been the case, like with so many fantasy/ sci-fi movies (if you ask me). It has just the right vibe.More of this please. Thank you.",10
"What seemed like a mere 80s throwback from the looks of it, Stranger Things is much more like a homage to that period.Drilled down to its bare, this is a story about a mother's search for her lost child and the finesse with which its crafted among elements of mystery and sci-fi makes it highly intriguing. The cast does justice to their roles especially the protagonists who have given a truly believable performance. The background score is chosen to perfection and amplifies the retro feel of the show. Stranger things wont be breaking your scare meter but it will take control over you and keep you engaged till the very end.",10
"The Duffer Brothers have nailed everything from the location and soundtrack to the cast with David Harbour fronting the way.Together combined to make a excellent 80s nostalgia experience without ever trying to force it. My best way to describe it would be you could throw it in the mix of some of the best back then and you wouldn't even noticed it was produced nearly 40 years later.The story has you hooked straight away and hits all the right buttons to create just a right amount of suspense, joy and maybe a few tears.I for one have been crying out for a series like this to come about so I am really looking forward to see where it goes next.",10
"Season 1 of Stranger Things is about a boy that went missing, a secret government agency, and a monster. It is obvious the writers of the show are fans of 80s era horror. There were enough allusions and homages that even the densest person would pick up on one. That it felt like a Stephen King story, adapted by Dean Koontz, and directed by Steven Spielberg is hardly a bad thing.At only eight episodes, this does not seem like a show that is padded. Unfortunately, that is not the case. The story with Joyce (Winona Ryder) became redundant once she and Hopper (David Harbour) joined forces. The only consistency this series has is with the children. Their story is the driving force behind the series, and anything else just felt off.All in all, this is a decent show, and well worth wasting an afternoon or two watching.",7
"For someone who doesn't love the 80s nostalgia (probably as I was not alive for them!) I was pleasantly surprised to find myself quickly immersed by the set dress and of course the amazing soundtrack. The casting and acting is fantastic especially eleven and the kids (I was even able to overcome my Winona Ryder aversion). However, I wasn't hooked until the 3-4th episode and that was short lived. I soon became bored of the cheesy cliché storyline, especially anything involving the teenagers, and the nods toward classic scifi and horror took over; leaving the plot unoriginal. Though in all I enjoyed the classic story, I feel it was tired and nothing special or worth the hype surrounding it. There was no major character arcs and the audience was too many steps ahead of the cast...leaving me frustrated. In my opinion the best thing about the show is the opening credits.",6
"Wow.I wasn't convinced when I started this series - it seemed good, but I typically abandon TV shows half-watched, and my hopes were low. This one, though, I finished in a day.The characters are always a selling point for me, and these guys stole my heart. Couple that with the bust of nostalgia (from the 80s tunes right down to Winona Ryder), a solid plot and plenty of action... well, you've got yourself a winner. I've heard it compared to movies like The Goonies or Stand By Me - which definitely works.I was hooked after the first two episodes - I'd recommend giving this one a watch.",10
"I watched this after a few recommendations, and I can tell you I won't be passing on the recommendation.The characters lack depth, but I guess its hard to show that over a short series.The story line draws inspiration from many old movies, nothing fresh and exciting.The music is good, but a lot of times it felt like the wrong choice of tone, I often wondered why some scenes had music at all.I feel like giving this a 1, to try and off set the 9.3 rating a bit.. I've rarely ever left a review before, in fact this could be my first one, but after seeing the rating I felt compelled to. This is definitely not the best show of all time.",3
"Our collective/condensed memories of the 80's. The Goonies, ET, Stand By me, and The Thing ""COULD"" have been ""Stranger Things""......IF Doc Brown had swapped a VHS copy of JJ Abraham's SUPER 8 into Marty's coat pocket instead of that Almanac!! ..and, as a result? ALL of our cherished 80's movies memories actually WERE like Stranger Things!Never - in the history of cinema/TV/subscription-bit-rate-bandwidth - have I seen ""child actors"" so perfectly found, rounded-up together, cast, and directed so fluidly, with that ""innocent essence"" we all still love and remember about the films of the 1980's!..Bravo!",10
"(Non spoilers) So I haven't really had much experience with the horror & sci-fi genre mix but this season was absolutely stunning. The flashbacks were smooth and perfectly timed packing even more feels to each scene. The quirky geek squad were sometimes predictable with their actions but they brought comedy and a separate theme of friendship to this TV series that made it just that more amazing. When I saw the 9.2 rating on IMDb (I think its going down slowly though) I was skeptical about a horror & sci-fi combo TV series getting this high of a score but after watching the entire season I happily will give this TV series a 9/10.(Spoilers) The only reason why it doesn't get a 10/10 is because although it starts with a violent shocking moment early on (where the shopkeeper gets shot), I never had that true feeling of unpredictability where you don't know who is going to die and at what moment. Another thing that they could of done is build up a back story more for Barbra and maybe used the other rude jocks (not Steve) a bit more.However all in all this an AMAZING T-V series and I strongly hope that they make a second season and that if they do that it will be as incredibly structured and just... ...damn good as this one was.",9
"Its becoming a habit of the Netflix machine to churn out outstanding viewing! seemingly like all new shows the 1st series episode count is low only 8 episodes and leaves you wanting more, I hope more is what we get in the form of series 2! brilliant cast/acting/story line completely out of the norm! love the 80's settings and nostalgia!The Cast a mixture of unknown/faces you recognise but have no idea of their name and Winona Ryder (the only cast member I can genuinely remember the name of when I started watching)Ryders performance in this is outstanding worthy of awards same to be said of the Millie Bobby Brown the young girl who plays Ele(Eleven)",10
"There are few movies or television series that I would call flawless. Even vaunted shows like Breaking Bad have their dud episodes, casting misfires, or occasional plot holes.I'm not going to rewrite the other reviews, talking about the great story, the fun (but not in your face) homages to classic horror and suspense movies, or how it gets the 80's just right.What I want to talk about is the AMAZING performances turned in by every single actor and actress. Obviously well-written, and well-directed, but absolutely well-performed as well. Any one of the performances by the 4 middle-school-aged kids that lead the action would be among the best child performances I have ever seen. All 4 together, in the same series, is mind-blowing. The adult leads are all Emmy caliber. Winona Ryder is unbelievable. David Harbour gives such a subdued performance as a broken Police Chief, without descending into the melodramatic and clichéd. I know Modine's been working right along, but this is the first thing I've seen him in in years.. and I think it's his best work. Even the minor roles.. the teacher, the police officers, the parents, are right on point, creating a television universe where complete suspension of disbelief is nearly automatic.I watched this show thinking that the hidden hand of Stephen King must somehow be involved.. more than just an inspiration. Writing from a kid's perspective (and getting it right), a la ""The Body"", or ""It"", is a rare skill indeed.Don't miss ""Stranger Things"".",10
"For several years I've researched various TV shows and movies to see if they're worth watching and for the most part I agree with the IMDb rating. Anything over a 9 is usually binge-worthy. Shows like The Sopranos, Breaking Bad, Dexter, Six Feet Under, etc live up to their ratings here but Stranger Things in the same category? I found it entertaining but the production, cinematography and sound track are just okay.I agree with those who have pointed out the similarities with ET, Poltergeist, Carrie. I watched the whole first season of Stranger Things and while it's better than most everything regular TV networks release these days I gotta say the rating is ""just a bit outside.""",5
"I expected more from this show. Stranger Things didn't surprised me. The first 4 episodes are slow and boring and the final episode is not epic.The best was the ambiance, a very good art direction (even 3D is designedly badly done).This TV series have a good sci-fi and adventure history but a bad horror and mystery. Acting is good, but writing is not. Good and bad points.It's not horrible but it's not a big show, it's just a 80's blockbuster so I think the nostalgia feeling is sedating people.6/10",6
"Netflix has done again after shows like Daredevil and House of Cards. Its almost like one new great show every year. First episode would grasp your interest to watch more. Acting by Eleven, Hopper and Joyce is really good. I don't hear about Duffer Brothers before, I guess this is their first big project and they nailed it. This show has been much better but I feel something not plausible. Like research done by 3 friends in search of Will. They are searching whole city, risking their lives and more. If the monster took Will, why wouldn't he will take you? In my opinion, someone adult or police should have done that kind of research in finding Will. Police Chief Hopper had done so much already but giving that role to children is over hypothetical. In real life that will never happen. Secondly, why the monster will keep Will alive. He captured Will in first 8 minutes, why didn't he just eat him? Why would he kill Barbara and other? And Finally, their science teacher he has answer to everything. Shoot any question and he has the answer ready. He didn't need to look into any book or anything. Except these 3 things, I really enjoyed the show. I guess Eleven and Monster are still alive and we'll see in Season 2. Its best Netflix show, certainly better than House of Cards or Daredevil. I don't say whether this is best new show of 2016 or not, because I hope HBO's 'Westworld' will be better. Hopefully they will maintain this kind of quality in Season 2.",8
"This mini-series has a lot of buzz before it's release. While I was seeing Marco Polo (pretty good series) saw the trailer and remember saying ""Looks like a good suspense-science-fiction mini series, I need to see this one"".Then I started. I fell into the trap.The issue here is that this is made for 10-15 years boys. It's a more than amazing show for that range. But there is no a direct message in the trailer implying this.In one of the first episodes, there is a scene of a dead person in the cafeteria with a bullet in his head, lying there, really explicit...if you know what I mean. This is really misleading. For a moment, I thought I was seeing a serious show with ""magic"" touches thanks to the kids and their story. How wrong I was.The number of scenes when any character made a stupid decision or movement, is countless. For example, the van flying in the air, falling in front of the 3 other government's vans in the pursuit: in serious story, they would have just passed through the vehicle's side and continue pursuing the kids that were ON BICYCLES!But not in this show. 10-15 years boys won't question that logic. So they don't have to take care of those details. All of those grownup who made it trhough the 7° episode, will anyhow finish the series anyway, so screw them.This is seriously, a trap for people over 18 years old.Be aware.",6
"Throughout the years I found it difficult to get rid of so many images in my head that came directly from some of Stephen King's novels. When I sat to watch the whole eight hours of Stranger Things I was in one of those trips of my life of which I didn't want out.This is a film, much more than a series. You could skip the intro titles and have a seamless story told with depth, comedy, heart and wit.From what I said above, you can tell I regard Stephen King pretty high on my list of American writers. He teamed once with the other Steve to make a series that promised something new (because the book was good) and utterly failed. So, I'd rather take King's writings than adaptations. But Spielberg's films are films, not books, and lots of them are absolutely fantastic. Borrowing from two great story-tellers and making something worth has never been easy. I'd say impossible. Because I haven't found anything even close to E.T. or ""The Body"" (which became Stand by Me), ever.And what makes this new Netflix venture worth a ton of gold is that it actually gets to places you and I want to go. The characters are beautifully drawn, and then layered and painted in a way they'll stick with you for a long time.This film, even with the slight criticism of not being perfect in some regards (like some of the songs), is a masterpiece of storytelling for kids, teens and adults. It is as enjoyable as E.T. was. So much that I want to see it on the big screen. It's not a trivial series. It's as serious as it gets.The kids in the film are memorable, really creating a brotherhood that I wanted to be a part of. All of them have their own problems, their very clearly defined personalities and roles, their charming funny sides... they're lovable and you can relate to any of them.Winona Rider's character is full of passion and realism in this otherwise completely fictitious tale. But, wasn't that what ""It"" gave us? Even with the terrible ending of the book and the miniseries, who in the world wouldn't remember Bev shooting her silver bullets in the sewer against ""It""? Or the conversation between Gordie and Chris under the tree when camping by the Royal River? Lines from the heart of gold of Stephen King. Action and adventure from the mind of Steven Spielberg. But this is different. Matt and Ross Duffer created something that may have all the elements of those 80's films and novels, but with freshness and depth.You can relate to the characters because they ARE human, they are well developed, you KNOW about them. That's King's turf. And the emotions, the adventures, the way they're captured are Spielberg's signature. But, alas! here we have both worlds in one film that will be as timeless as It was or E.T. Characters like Eleven may be part of future conversations of younger generations, as are Gordie and Chris, who will never stop moving young and adult audiences even 40 years later.The whole success of this series is that, at last, the Duffers brought to the screen something with real soul. And that's pretty uncommon nowadays.",10
"I only manage to finish this series by ""purge watching."" It's my own term. It's the opposite of ""binge watching"" where you're apparently so enraptured by a show you can't stop watching. ""Purge watching"" is when you can't wait for a series to be over, so you use the fast forward button during the throw-away, series-padding scenes. And there's a lot of padding in the show. Like a cheap Stephen King Santa. Honestly, are we supposed to really accept this asa ""homage"" or is it just the ultimate recycling job? A number of critics thought 8 hours devoted to the somewhat thin story of ""Stranger Things"" was excessive. I was thinking about the story in my head, and if it hadn't been given the soap opera drag out treatment, condensed down to a 2-hour movie it would have been even worse -- exposing more clearly the basic silliness and retread plot. The watered-down tempo helped what otherwise would have been Cream of Condensed Tripe. You could claim running the same old numbers is in the name of ""homage"" or you could argue there's really not a lot of new ideas in the show. From the first scene where the scientists get pulled upward into the elevator, dangled by an unseen beast, I went ""ho hum."" Like I haven't see that visual in a million monster films. An old clever show like the X-Files would have had a pair of eyes creepily material in the wall of an elevator and then maybe the doors close and a scream. That show as extremely creative at coming up with original ideas and images -- which is why it was a great show. But immediately I wasn't that impressed with the ""Duffer Brothers"" mise en scene. I need more ""things I've never seen before"" from Sci-fi. And little touches like the elevator scene are where true originals and moderate talents separate themselves. I nearly bailed completely on the series. Episode 3&4 were sluggishly directed by Shawn Levy, who is pretty much an incompetent as a stylist. By episode 4, it has completely lost the ""vintage feel"" and leaning on the influences of contemporary cable: Let's play a moving piece of rock music over amontage of the different actors staring thoughtfully into space. The music swells... It's the HBO Method of audience intercourse. A directorial cliché. Sorry, but this doesn't have the ""feel"" of a 70s or 80s production at all, maybe a bit in the opening episode or two, but it pretty much is quickly replaced by a run-of-the-mill cable show feel. Vintage Spielberg always had a very kinetic feel. 70s and early 80s films were riffing off the vibe of Altman, Pennebaker, Penn, but sanitizing them a bit and joking them up. The vibe of this series is probably closest in spirit to the lousy cheapie Steven King films, and not in a good way. It's a leaden feel. I'm still skeptical of the ""tribue"" aspect of this show The Winonna""Poltergiest"" ripoff/tribute is the worst bit so far. Where's the dwarf psychic? As I also noted they managed to pay ""homage"" to ""Under the Skin"" and ""Pan's Labyrinth"" Were those nostalgic ""homages?"" If your pose a show as a tribute (and make sure to let people know up front to cover your tracks) does that eradication the icky ""borrowing."" I think a couple of producers (the Duffers you would assume) sat down and said: ""Yeah, I like the kid with powers from FireStarter, let's use that. And the kids from ""It"". The whole kid thing from King. ""Alien"" was a great movie. How about goo? And we'll stay away from the afterlife and just make it a portal to another dimension...."" Add Shaw Levy's teleplay staging (someone should let him know the camera moves) and it's all a bit snoozy. By the way, I also notice that the Duffer Brothers didn't write the series. They farmed out the episodes to a bunch of writer. Right there, their auteur status goes down the drain, IMO. Interestingly, I noticed that the Duffer Brothers wrote the teleplay for Episode 8, but another writer suddenly turns up with a ""story by"" credit (for the first time in the series) for that episode. That tell's me the Duffers' couldn't even figure out how to put a cap on their own series and brought in someone else to make sense of it. And the ending is all pretty perfunctory and predictable. They even managed to reproduce Steven King's most reliable device ... not being able to produce a really satisfying ending. So anyway, that's that. I'd give it a""C."" And warn Steven King to keep his paper covered during the next test.",4
"I'm mad I waited so long to watch this. It was sitting in my queue for the longest and I had no idea what I was denying myself. What a great cast, such a compelling and intriguingly woven tale. The music was so invoking yet non-invasive. That title graphic alone is brilliant. As an 80s baby the sounds and the visuals brought on some serious nostalgia. Goodness, I'm sure there's something wrong with this show, but there's so much good about it, I either didn't notice or it doesn't matter.Well, I guess the negative could be that it's ONLY 8 episodes long! Oy! Now I have to figure out what to do with myself. Here comes the binge crash.Good stuff! Good good stuff!",9
"Netflix did it again with Stranger Things. It's a very pleasant and easy to follow series to watch. It's like a time warp back to the eighties. A mixture of The Goonies meets The X-Files meets Close Encounters Of A Third Kind. I watched the whole first season in just a couple days. You immediately get hooked on this show. I don't know if the makers will add another season to it and if they do I'm already very curious what it will be about. Will it be a complete other story or will it just continue where the first season ended? It doesn't matter to me, I just want more seasons like this one. The cast is very good. All the actors fit perfectly well in the story. There is enough suspense to keep you interesting all the time. Watch this one, you won't regret it.",9
"It's time for #realtalk. STRANGER THINGS is OVERRATED. Apparently everyone looking down the barrel of turning 40 years old decided they needed nostalgic rejuvenation and rode this TV-PG ""boner for the 80's"" all week.Even at 8 eps it runs too long. The story could have easily been told as a movie. And it's so intentionally filled with cliché -- if I have to see a black hole explained with a folded piece of paper & a pencil thru it ONE MORE TIME! -- that it tastes stale and feels exaggeratedly sentimental.That said, there is some fun in watching the show, just know it's family friendly TV and not a dark or dramatic story aimed at adults. But the fun isn't enough to carry it for 8 hours.",6
"I went in to watch this series without any understanding of what it's about, and the style of it. Even though I had heard a lot of boasting about this, I figured I'd just try it. When it first started I got chills. It felt kind of nostalgic but new. The style reminds me of Twin Peaks.I was hooked before episode 1 was done, and I ended up binge-watching the whole season. The characters are fantastic, and the acting is really impressive. The story was perfect and left me in a state in which I can't wait until the next season.The Duffer brothers have made this my all time favorite series.",10
"Netflix has commissioned some great shows of late, Making a Murderer, Better Call Saul, Narcos, Bloodline and now Stranger Things.When you see the trailer you think, OK a homage to the 80's but so what... Well I've not seen a series of it's genre that not only shocks, scares and thrills but actually builds likable yet flawed characters through great writing, directing and acting (and very well edited of course).The main stars of the show are the children who are natural, funny and utterly believable. Think Pans Labyrinth meets a Spielberg film but darker and better! Give it a go.",9
"This is a decent show that in my opinion unfortunately doesn't come nowhere near a 9 or a 10 that most people have given it .I'll try to keep it as short as possible and go with the pros first:1)The acting is very good and the kids did a nice job especially the girl playing Eleven and the boy playing Dustin.2)The general idea of the show is interesting (but ruined by some very stupid stuff,more on that in the cons)3)I liked the cinematography and the overall tone/atmosphere of the show4)The music/soundtrack is coolNow to the cons:1)The monster in the show is basically a walking rotting flower with teeth that comes from an evil dimension and it seems to be the sole inhabitant of that place.I could somehow get past the fact that it's alone but the way it looks really ruined the show for me.I can't believe that anybody in their right mind can give a green light for that look.2)The pace of the show is extremely slow and I feel like it could have easily been 4 episodes instead of 8.3)The stupidity of most of the characters is at an insane level:a)Jonathan and Nancy.This is basically their thinking: 'You know that creature that comes through walls and that took away 2 kids already? How about we take a gun and a baseball bat and go alone into the woods at night and kill it.' They basically attempted this 2 times(the 2nd time they even kind of know what they're dealing with which makes that attempt even more ridiculous).I'm sorry but I just couldn't believe that somebody would be that dumb and that also ruined the show for me.b)The sheriff broke into that facility once and got caught(and they just let him go but they immediately kill the burger dude in the diner for no reason whatsoever??),so he figured why not give it a second shot,f**k the cameras and the probably increased security,this time it's gotta work right? Stupid ,lazy screen writing that doesn't make any sense.c)Hey teacher excuse me for calling so late but how exactly do you make a sensory deprivation chamber?Say what?Why do I ask?It's just for an experiment .Oh it's for an experiment you say? Well if that's the case let me just explain this real quick to a 10 year old.You boys be safe,good night ;)I could go on and on but I'll just wrap it up by saying that this show was a bit of a disappointment for me.It had great potential and an interesting premise that was ruined by lazy writing and the worst looking monster I have ever laid eyes on.I'd compare this to Wayward Pines,a couple of interesting mysterious episodes but then it just went downhill.I'm giving it a 6.5-7 /10.",7
"I read an interview with the kids in this show in which they called it a period piece. Calling Stranger Things a period piece is an oversimplification. No, this show is an honest to goodness time machine. It may as well have been made in the 80's. Sure, there are some modern special effects, but they are modest, and not really distracting from the feeling that you really are back in the 80's while watching this show.The music. OH the music. That deep synthesizer reminiscent of so many classic Sci-Fi and Horror movies of the time. From the PERFECTLY done opening titles, to the sparse but immensely timed score, it sets the tone, and prepares you for something great.That said, the acting is what makes this show something truly special. It took me at least 10 minutes of screen time to realize I was watching Wynona Ryder. To a one, the cast is phenomenal. Finn Wolfhard (the most awesome name ever) as Michael is the second coming of Henry Thomas' Elliot in E.T. The kid is awesome, but there's no way, at that age, that he could be such a perfect analogue for Elliot. That's great casting, an adult who saw a you be actor who was just like Henry Thomas at that age. Toothless is SO the ""Wolfman gots nards"" kid from Monster Squad, and he kills it. El...Millie Brown Bobby is the next great thing. She communicates so much with just her facial expressions, you just want to love her before she even says a word.Stranger Things is also mature, thoughtful, and sometimes terrifying. It spends ample time on its characters, and it makes their lives relate-able in that way we never want to relate.Kudos to Netflix, once again, for taking a shot at an underdog and coming out a Champ.",10
"Just finished this. This has been one of the most amazing things I have ever had the pleasure of watching. The cast,the score,the direction....everything is literally perfect! I found myself creeped out/intrigued/heartfelt/amused.....just absolutely absorbed and invested in every single word spoken and scene shot. Aside all of this,its set authentically in the 80s where kids on bikes are the heroes (Think E.T/Goonies etc). The character dynamics across the board were faultless and having Mobys 'When its cold Id like to die' in the final moments (A hugely sentimental piece of music to me anyway) was just genius and don't think any other moment of anything else could warrant using it. Bravo to the Duffer brothers for an absolute masterpiece from start to finish. I don't impress easy but this is a straight up 10/10 without hesitation",10
"Story >> The story is good but not unique, you can pretty much see it in some of the horror films. That's right, the show didn't appear as a series to me but as a good horror/mystery movie rather. There's no twists and turns. It didn't give quite the scare or mysterious vibe.Characters >> The characters are generic. The actors/actresses' portrayal is fine but sometimes, becomes annoying. There's nothing depth about the characters, even the supposed to be mysterious ones aren't intriguing but perhaps, they'll grow in season 2. Usually, there are characters that you'll like the moment you see them, but that isn't the case in here. I can't root for them, I just see them as plain characters of a show. I don't feel any connection towards any of them that I won't really care if someone dies.Graphics >> It's pretty good. I do appreciate most of the movie/show graphics, actually. Since I'm always left in wonder of how they can pull it off.Sound >> It's lacking in this point. This is one of the reasons why it didn't give quite a scare or mysterious vibe. The choice of music isn't impressive either.Overall >> It's good and worth a watch, but I don't think it deserved a 9+ rating. In the end, it isn't bad, but it isn't that good either.",7
"Honestly, I've never been a fan of science fiction, so I didn't think I was going to like it as much as everyone else does. But I'm pleasantly surprised. I mean, it's not the greatest show I've ever seen, but I watched the first season over two days and I can't wait for more. One of the best things about Stranger Things is the acting. I'm always impressed when kids can act because I know when I was a kid I would've been so over the top and dramatic, but for the most part these kids are total naturals, specifically Millie Brown and Gaten Matarazzo. They were better than some of the adults. The kids reminded me of a blend of The Goonies, Stand By Me, and Freaks & Geeks, which I really loved because it was great to see characters like that again and it just felt right for the story. My one complaint however was the swearing, especially in front of parents. I'm not sure why the media always has young kids swearing but that is so unrealistic to me. I never knew any kids that swore when I was that age. I'm not offended by swearing, it's just that it was a bit distracting because it felt like they were trying too hard. The relationship between the actors felt so real; you really believed they had grown up together and were the best of friends. There were only a couple actors that I felt shouldn't have been cast, but for the most part the cast was perfect. I couldn't believe how few roles so many of them have had, and yet they were so believable. From the very first episode you are completely hooked. The intro is so short and simple yet it's perfect. The music and graphics go so well together. It's not an opening credits that you feel like skipping. There was one scene when my jaw dropped and I knew instantly there was going to be so much to uncover. I loved the story lines and the nostalgic feeling I had when watching Stranger Things. A time before Internet and cell phones, when kids used their imagination and went on adventures. I grew up in the nineties and it's rare to find a show these days that doesn't rely heavily on being current. I was glad that there was hardly any sex in this show (I'm sounding like a complete prude, I know) because I think that will give it a chance for teens to watch it with their parents without it being awkward or too mature for younger viewers. This is the type of show we need right now. Just a good, suspenseful, mysterious drama to indulge in. It's the perfect blend of scifi and drama and I can't wait to find out what happens next season.",8
"I want to write a review on how amazingly this show is executed. It felt like I am watching a classic 80's film. Every single detail was hit to perfection. There are some flaws with the show and there aren't but a couple of characters of which you'd care. It's cliché and predictable but none of that matters. The opening credits are so pulled from the influences that I actually felt like I was back 30 years ago watching something fresh. It's boring and you really don't give a crud about any of the characters, but you still watch it. To me, that's an amazing accomplishment. David Hauser and Winona Ryder KILL IT!! The other characters you either hate or just tolerate. Regardless, for something I actually disliked watching, for the sheer genius of execution, I give a solid 10!!",10
"It reminded me of my childhood!I was excepting it for a long time since i heard of it!! It was more than I expected! All my best movies in one, combining mystery, fantasy ,weird humour and great music!!! Perfect scenery, great cast, i am so happy to see Winona Ryder!! The atmosphere gets you so much in the eighties mood that we love so much!! I hope more series like that will come!!I already put it first on my list with my favorites !! I definitely would suggested to everyone seeing it! It leaves you with some questions that makes you wonder.. May be a season two will come..",10
"I have watched hundreds and thousands of movies and TV series and rated them all but its my second review for anything on IMDb. I had feeling that i have to write about it. After Mr. Robot, this TV show ""Stranger Things"" just passed out all the standards of being perfect. Its so addicted that you cant leave without watching whole show in one sit. While watching I was remembering the old classics ""Stand by Me"" & ""The Breakfast Club"" and enjoying the better added fantasy and perfection to it. Seriously i don't know who are the creators of Netflix but those people are really great and should make some historical hits like this. I will save this in my archive of best shows ever.",10
"Contains spoilers...I'll get straight to the point, I will not watch season 2. I really really wanted to like this show but NOTHING happens in it. Seems like the writers are building the story up to for what may (or may not) be more interesting in the future but I will not waste any more time on it. Here is a quick review of what happened on season 1: - Kid gets kidnapped by scary creature - Sheriff looks for the kid and believe at some point that a secret organization is hiding him - Some girl has super powers and can contact the creature world (which is a parallel dimension), locate people there, etc'... - Secret organization chasing after girl with super powers, girl smack their asses every time. - Sheriff and missing kid's mom going to other dimension to rescue kid (they succeed) - girl kills creature and disappears with itThis main story could have been made to a lousy one and half/two hour film, instead it stretches on almost eight hours with in-between cliché teenager stories and uninteresting sub plots. 80's ambiance is great with sound track, acting and overall feeling. Plot-wise, The other dimension had no story depth which makes the main story feel shallow, just some brainless killer creature/s from a parallel dimension, a kid getting kidnapped (and get saved eventually) and a girl with telekinetic powers which we learn almost nothing about and why she has those powers.",6
"Everything about this series is excellent.Cast, screen writing, the period piece, soundtrack, acting; its all amazing.David Harbour is beyond amazing. He should get nominated for a Golden Globe for his role as the Chief.Winona Ryder is excellent. Loved they are acting again together. Previous was in The Iceman (2012) which if you haven't seen is excellent.This series by the Duffer Brothers developed the characters beyond anything I can recall seeing recently. Every character is likable or not and its because you know something about them. Right down to the boys science teacher.Matthew Modine is extremely good as the federal agent. I can't recall a role he's done that I didn't like.Please have an open mind with this series and watch it. Rewatch any unfinished episodes. Netflix Original nailed it yet again.Excellent.",5
"Sure, the 80s look and feel is great, including the title sequence and the music, but that's not all.Every main character evolves and becomes better versions of themselves. The use of Dungeons & Dragons as a metaphor to help us and the main characters to understand what is happening.This show was very well thought out and executed.I don't like giving 10/10 because (usually) nothing is perfect, there's always things that could have been done better, but the creators of Stranger Things nailed everything. Well done!Let's hope season 2 is just as good! :)",10
"This has been described as a ""love letter to '80's cinema"", with its cheesy gooey monsters and boundary-crossing research on humans that drive the plot. I don't watch this genre, but fell in love with Stranger Things. There's the main plot of trying to find a lost boy, and then the plots and relationships that develop around it - a group of kids that form their own search party to look for their friend, and their relationship with another kid who is running from mysterious bad guys and whom they enlist to help them. I love this show for the epic monster-battles and the loyalty that the kids have for each other. It's one of those things where they have their own little world, separate from the adults, and is the cutest thing to watch.*Possible spoiler* The solitary reason I gave it 9 stars instead of 10 is that the friendships take a predictable turn in one way. Nevertheless, I give it major points for not being afraid to make their bond more complicated than being perfect all the time, which makes it realistic and all the sweeter for it. Absolutely fantastic.",9
"This show is really addictive. Once I started watching, I just couldn't stop! The cast is just amazing. The way the kids bond, their crazy comments (especially Dustin's) are so hilarious! Everything lovable in good movies seem to be in the show. It makes you feel like you're part of the story, like you're pulled in to that small strange town, observing from its other dimension.If you're a big fan of Spielberg's and King's stories and their wonderful way of telling stories, you're in for a treat. There are only eight episodes. So, it's easy to just gulp down the entire season one in one night -- which I did. I can't wait for season two to see how the unresolved problem will develop and how the characters will cope with it this time.",9
"I don't usually get too excited about new T.V. shows I've recently discovered, apart from maybe 'Vikings,' but on this occasion it must be mentioned.If you haven't already I implore you to watch this show.The Acting is superb, the casting spot on, the soundtrack inspired, the pacing and mood totally mesmerizing. I have tried very hard to find faults or weak links in each episode and I honestly can't.It's all those great movies and T.V. shows we grew up watching as kids all rolled in to one, and yet in so many ways better than any of them. They all played a part in our childhood, they still give us that wonderful feeling of nostalgia and that is exactly what 'Stranger Things' does. It reminds us of how film used to make us feel when we where kids, and how could that possibly be a bad thing?Millie Bobby Brown deserves an Oscar, she has more talent in her little finger than half the cast of 'Game of Thrones.' Every one word / line delivery leaves you entirely invested in her performance, every emotion is displayed so intensely and openly in her eyes that she puts most adult actors to shame.This show deserves your attention, it may have taken a lot from the old 80's classics but isn't that what great art is? Paying homage to what came before but also respectfully making it better?",7
"This is a show, where I can't really understand negative reviews. - Some write the acting was terrible/awful.. -> What? As an actor I can almost certainly guarantee you, that the acting was solid, if not outstanding (eleven) and if you didn't like it, it is probably because the person or their character is not appealing for you to watch. Also keep in mind, there were many takes and the ones that made it into the final product, are the ones the directors wanted, so blame them and not the actors. - Some write the plot was boring/simple/predictable and the story didn't really come to an end and didn't answer all questions. -> What? This is a Mystery show, if you answer all questions, whats mysterious about it? o0 Most of you don't seem to understand this business at all. You have to kind of bring the show to an end and leave some backdoors for possible more seasons if the show is a success. How do you think this is possible if not by how the creators of this show did it? Oh an the plot was boring/predictable, etc.? Well congratulations you probably have watched and/or read lots of scifi/mystery/thriller movies and books, because for me it was really entertaining and not predictable at all. And even if you figured what could happen next, it was still interesting to watch how the characters would react etc.To anyone giving this less than 6/10 this is just unfair. The acting is solid if not very good, the soundtrack is amazing, cinematography is outstanding, coloring is great, effects are very decent, how can you give this profession no credit? If you would give 1 point for every job that has been done well in this show, you cannot get less than 6/10 unless you rate only by your personal taste and that is a highly subjective rating and thus not really helpful/significant to other people.",10
"Noir 80's feel for the whole series combined with some amazing storytelling and script. Great acting, directing and some pretty cool set pieces.The atmosphere was there, and it seems that all the actors actually enjoyed taking part which made the whole series flow much better.The best way to describe it without ruining anything for those that haven't seen it is.. Well, throw in a bit of old school 80's horror, add a dash of Alien with a sprinkling of Nightmare on Elm Street. Stir in bit of poltergeist and lightly finish off with a touch of The Goonies.It's one of those gems of a series that you will enjoy.. Heck, even my mother who's in her late 60s loved it.My only complaint? It could have easily been fleshed out to more episodes and more time spent on the missing boy (those who have seen it will know what I mean) and for that reason only, it loses a point. Otherwise a sure fire 10/10.Even so, Everyone who took part should be proud and take a deserved bow.Here's hoping for season 2...",9
"This movie has something for anyone who grew up loving 80's Sci-Fi only with better production values. Everything is vintage and authentic: the setting, the villains, the protagonists, the atmosphere, the stereotypes, the bullies...even the credits reminded me of my youth. As you would imagine with so many 10 star ratings, the story is compelling and the acting is brilliant. I started watching this based on a recommendation from my daughter and before I knew it, it was 2:30 in the morning. I haven't immersed myself in a show like this in a very long time and I loved every minute of it. Bravo to Netflix for another wonderful, if not their best, original series.",10
"Stranger Things a most enjoyable 80s throw back. This series comprises a lot of elements that I personally love in movie making. The story was amazingly written and the cast was terrific. The two things that most count in making a hit.The story gels together nicely from episode to episode. The hook is well done at the end of every episode bringing you back for the next episode. The cast was awesome with every actor portrayal be great even the bit actors.I love the way elements from Steven Spielberg movies and elements form Stephen King books were brought together with the makers paying homage to both. The 1980s setting is so good and well done. I personally love 80s movies and having that feeling was fantastic, pure nostalgia.I miss movie making like this where storytelling and talented actor drive the film. Now it's rehash, reboot and special effects galore with no substance at all. Originality is out the window with just poor and lazy movie making.It feels like one long movie with a running time of just over 7 hrs with episodes being roughly 52 minutes long with others a little shorter. My only problem would be the slow pace in some episodes, the ones which are over 52 minutes. It could have been edited a little better by shortening the episodes to about 48 minutes.With every actor's performance being good from child actors to adult actors, good story telling and a 80s styling, Stranger Things is a great example of how movie making should be done. A strong nine out of ten, near flawless and I highly recommend it. I'm sure you won't be disappointed.",9
"I can't believe what garbage this show was. Watching nothing but screaming and panic for hours upon end, no character background to be found, horrible humming noises, and every cliché ever made dumped into a sloppy mess. The monster, the government, and the kid 11 have almost no meaning, no explanation, and no relationship to each other. The only reason this gets anything over a rating of 1 is because the costumes and background really reminded me of the old days (haha). I don't know why they left the ending open like they did. If they're planning on a second season they should consider starting over and using a different cast.",4
"Stranger things is best watched at once, binge watching all 8 episodes, as this really makes you appreciate how intricate and detailed the storytelling is, being presented as a long movie more than a series. The characters are extremely releateable, and diverse, with multiple characters and subplots which all connect back to each other in brilliant ways, leaving enough mystery for the inevitable season 2.The 80s nostalgia is hugely present, the series being clearly influenced by the likes of Spielberg, Stephen King among others, and the series is all the better for it.The soundtrack is also great, creating an eerie presence, whilst also featuring classic tracks from the period.Overall, I highly recommend checking it out.",10
"The story takes place in 1983 Hawkins, Indiana. When a middle school boy named Will mysteriously vanishes his three best friends, mother, brother and a local police chief become engrossed in supernatural events in an attempt to find him. The plot for this movie feels like something out of a Stephen King novel. It seems like the show is self-aware its own influences too. There are references made to eighties sci-fi horror films all throughout the series (Evil Dead, The Thing). So this isn't the most original show ever made, and I admit if I was just going off of the plot description, I probably wouldn't have invested my time in it. But this series offers something pretty interesting. It isn't something completely new, but it takes previous works and blends them together to create a story and style of its own. Imagine the Goonies and Twin Peaks colliding with a John Hughes film and a Stephen King novel and getting dropped in the middle of The Twilight Zone's universe. That best describes Stranger Things. Its creativity comes from its ability to mix influences and that's why it clings on to you with in the first episode. It provides something that is familiar but ultimately gives us something new.Eighties nostalgia is alive and well and you can clearly see its influences in the today's art-work, whether it be music, film or fashion. The only problem I've ever had with eighties-influenced art is when the artist makes something that is outdated and clearly would only work if been made in the eighties. However, Stranger Things is different. It wouldn't work as well if it was made in the eighties. The modern visual effects, directing, and cinematography compliment the series beautifully and make it easier to immerse yourself in this type of art. The modernization of this story gives it a component of clarity. While if this was made in the eighties, it would have gotten buried because it would just be stamped as another clichéd sci-fi thriller. But today, it stands out as a uniquely stylized and beautifully composed masterpiece. But it isn't just the style and visuals that keep you engaged. The story line twists enough to always keeps you guessing, but never enough to alienate or confuse you (like an M. Night Shyamalan film). The acting is phenomenal. Wynona Rider showcases her incredible acting chops to their full extent. She gives an absolutely heartbreaking performance. While the young actors in this film show us that their inexperience never gets the better of them. They never get overshadowed by their seasoned co-stars.One of the most admirable things about this series is that is stays well-grounded even with all the ridiculously abnormal activity. The charters never seem over-the-top or clichéd. Everyone in the series stays relatable. The story never gets confusing or incoherent. The blend of CGI with the natural backgrounds never gets sloppy or excessive. The score compliments the style beautifully. It never exaggerates a scene but keeps us submerged in the story by providing a signature eeriness to each scene.Stranger Things is truly another one of Netflix's crowning achievements. I look forward to the seasons to come.",9
"This film is a love letter to fans of the genre. Absolutely a gem for all time. Once you start you cant STOP!!! Top Notch execution!I haven't seen a film that has kept my attention like this one has in a very long time. The story is so bold but yet flourishes with tenderness, it will literally make you feel every emotion imaginable like a harp being strummed from one end to the other. Don't miss out on a well executed film. It has surpassed so many of my expectations and has put many blockbuster films of the genre to shame. Take it from me it has made me and instant fanboy.Till Next Time!!",9
"I have never seen a professional actor overact the way that Ryder does in this series. Beside the other actors, she looks like the amateur who does 'crazy' so badly that one thinks she has Parkinson's. The other actors reaction to her is of simple amazement that she has chosen the same trembling, entire body movement to express a simple sentence. No wonder she hasn't been in anything for years. People have finally had enough of her. Why they decided to drag her out of hiding to do this series is anyone's guess. The rest of the cast was OK. Some of the dialogue was pretty forced, but even the kids do a better job than Winona Ryder. She ruins the series.",7
"Honestly, although this show definitely has a homage to old movies and books, it's more original than most shows you will see today. I love the feel of the show, it definitely has that vintage ""80's-90s"" feel to it. And i love that the only ""big"" star is Winona Ryder (sorry if spelt wrong) it makes it seem and feel real, despite the whole, evil monster, upside down world. The kids dress like kids and act like real kids which makes it all the more relatable and draws you in. It's so intense and thrilling. I'm not one to yell at the TV during a scary movie but this show had my attention. It reminds me of good old movies like ""stand by me"" or ""sandlot"" because its authentic to how kids act unlike shows hot in the media like ""fuller house"" where kids where bow ties and say ""holy chalupa"" instead they use actual language a kid of their age would or have actions that they would really make. It's not sugar coded and sex, drugs, alcohol, bullying and much much more are real. No one is perfect and that's what really hits home, that's what makes it original. And even when you see the monster it's not completely fake looking like in most horror films now. Most shows now are the same thing over and over again; perfect family, perfect house, drama drama drama, perfect hair, ugly mixed matched clothes that are supposed to be cool, perfect kids who do no wrong. It's annoying. Everyone is also, honestly, a pretty good actor/ actress. The acting isn't so robotic. And the mystery keeps you so invested. They give you enough in each episode to really keep you interested and intrigued. Very much hope there is more to come in another season.",10
"If your not a Netflix subscriber you've probably never heard of this show, but from what I can see it's getting advertised quite well, so I could be wrong.""Stranger Things"" is an 80's style sci-fi/horror type of drama, as of today there are eight episodes so far. Winona Ryder is an excellent choice for a pivotal role in this saga. She is a tour de force, watching her on screen brings smiles to my face because she really hasn't been in anything remotely good for a really long time.The series really has a mixture of everything that was cool back in the early 80's it was like I was watching this through the eyes of a 10 year old boy with wonder and amazement. We are introduced to many characters, with roles similar to either ""The Goonies"" or ""Stand By Me"" There are also hints of the film ""Firestarter"" as well. I really don't want to give too much away. So I won't make this a spoiler review. Just a generalization.Every episode seems to have a theme, but sticks to the basic underlying plot and some great tunes from the 80's to go along with it. With the likes of the late David Bowie and so forth. There is also some elements of the X-Files from time to time, but it's not very pronounced and in your face, just a very subtle feeling from that show, even though it was based in the 90's, it still has that feel.It was nice seeing Matthew Modine in this show as well, I haven't seen him in so long I could hardly recognize him. Unknown to me Charlie Heaton plays a really strong role as well, he has a lot of talent. The three main child actors Finn Wolfhard, Caleb McLaughlin, Gaten Matarazzo bring to their roles such passion they make you feel like a kid again.""Stranger Things"" is a well rounded show, that has allowed forgotten actors from the past to breath new life into television again, with so many shows based on Zombies and Reality, it's nice to sink your teeth into something fun and mysterious such as this show. ""Stranger Things"" could go anywhere, and do anything the gates are wide open, and it's just amazing the talented writers in this world can still master the marvel of cinematography. I recommend this show to anyone above the age of ten. Some kids might find some scenes frightening, but all in all a definite winner.",9
"This show is one of the best shows of 2016. The 1980s time period was captured quite well. The town, the clothes, the hair styles stayed very true to the period. At first I didn't know if Wynona Ryder was going to be good in this kind of role, she did fantastic. It's in the vein of movies like The Goonies or Monster Squad or Lean on me were the children play an important part of driving the story. By the end of the season as you finish the last episode you will be sad that you will have to wait to see the next chapter in the series. The Netflix all episodes available at once model makes this a buffet your upset when it closes.",9
"There is a reason this is unoriginal and its because the Duffer brothers are paying homage to Stephen Kings IT since they were not allowed be a part of the big screen remake for next year. IT was one of my favourite childhood horror mini series although seems more like a long movie in reality. I knew it seemed so familiar before reading an article about the remake of the Stephen King Classic. From the outset the geeky kids who are best friends, the school bullies, the bicycles; I was almost thinking one of them would should out "" Hi ho silver away!"" when riding at speed. Of course this is a line from The Lone Ranger but its not what I associate the expression with. The lair where Winona Ryders son is discovered and how he is disconnected is almost exactly the same as the lair in IT. The alien or creature is very similar to the creatures in Stephen Kings Dreamcatcher especially when the mouth or head is open. The idea of the worm and how it gets into the water supply at the very end is identical to the goal of the creatures in Dreamcatcher. The special powers of Eleven are pretty much the same as the special powers of Duddits in Dreamcatcher who also gets weaker and is dying slowly during the movie. I was anticipating Eleven would transform into another creature to tackle and defeat the creature here that didn't quite happen but she was able to destroy it and herself together again the same result as what happens in the end of Dreamcatcher. Also in the first half of this scene when the kids are using the slingshot to fire stones at the creature this is exactly what the kids do in IT instead they are firing pieces of silver at Pennywise. I had to laugh at the morgue scene with the fake body again an exact copy of the idea from a classic Horror movie of the late 80's called Society. I think the mini series is very well done but clearly has no original ideas and just shows how underestimated and under appreciated Stephens Kings IT & Dreamcatcher are. You could say there are elements of The Goonies & ET in here too as well as The Species series of movies but mainly its IT & Dreamcatcher combined. The only new element in the series is ""The Upside Down"" which seems very like what happens in Insidious. I'm not complaining that its crap because its not original and its impossible nowadays to be original anyway but it seems most people I've talked to about this series either have never heard of IT or have forgotten most of that series and certainly never watched Dreamcatcher so they think this is original and think it deserves more credit than it actually does. Having said that the fact that the directors would try to emulate Stephen King and are excited about the big screen remake of IT tell us that they wanted to recreate what was done before and try to capture the atmosphere of a Stephen King mini series and I respect that being a big fan myself of his work. A lot of people say his books do not translate well into TV or movies which may explain why the rating for IT/Dreamcatcher are so much lower than Stranger Things however for me this show only makes me want to re-watch the classics and reminds how much better the older movies with original ideas were. Most of the acting is good and characters are likable. There are some very predictable scenes for example the fight over the girl near the cinema complex and how you know straight away what the Christmas present is before the box is opened. Also you knew Barbs was going to cut herself somehow at the pool party. Its very nostalgic and worth a look and I'm glad I watched it as its looks sharp and authentic.",7
"Even though I often find movies on IMDb overrated, I was expecting something good from this because of the 9.3. I am convinced that this is a case of the people rating something highly be cause it seems like it should be good. yes, its got lots of references from the 80s, but that does not mean its any good. We'll start with the worst dialogue ever. there were several places where the writings was so bad and you could actually see it straining to be funny. Worst in this department were the three screechy kids. One of them was a kind of hybrid character of GOONIES' Chunk, and Stand by Me's Vern. The chemistry between him and the black kid just missed the mark, the dead pan was never deadpan enough and the ""clever dialogue"" bits fell flat. although I' admit the other kid actually seemed to fit in the time and place being represented. Winona Ryder. She is so hit and miss. There are moments when she seems quite believable as the character but at other times ....just not. Worst though, might be the lack of originality, with ideas being stolen from all sorts of 80s titles. The 80s atmosphere felt less like the 80s and more like some a version of what a current have imagined it would be like from their distorted 2016 perception.",2
"For three episodes I tried and tried to like this ... But to keep a mystery like this going you have to have interesting characters ... And NONE of these were ... And they ain't pretty either ... Poor old Winona Ryder looks rough as hell in a cast that either looks inbred or suffering from an eating disorder !!! ... So along with a bad cast, well, nothing of interest happens In fact nothing much of anything happens ... A series of cliche's ( rather than the reworking of 80s tropes as the makers would try to have you believe ) plod out on the screen in an increasingly less interesting manner ... Visually it is tired and uninventive ... I gave it 2 and a half hours of my life and all this mediocre fluff has proved to me is that I have a lot better things to do with it than bother wasting another 5 finding out where this clunker is going",2
"I really don't get what the excitement is about this series. For me, the plot stumbles from one cliché to the other (people may call it ""references to the 80's"" but forget that the 80's were the most boring period in the past 50 years). Acting is quite awful - Winona Ryder horrid. David Harbour is probably the best from the bunch. All the high school backdrop is awfully tedious and cliché-ridden. The merits of this series are only the cinematography (even though we've seen all those tricks before as well) and the way in which a certain level of suspense is effectively created. No need for a second season here. Please just cancel the show.",6
"If you enjoy horror and thriller staff, this one is what you are looking for. Despite the fact that I didn't fall in love with the story, I liked the atmosphere a lot and it simply drags us back to the old times- you know, no smartphones, no internet etc. Everything you focus is the people themselves and how they act.*** SPOILER ALERT *** I mean you can create a story that is related to the parallel universes and physics, yet this sort of faceless monsters simply ruin the shows. Even if that is for the 'horror' and the 'mystery' part, something more humanoid would make the series more realistic, therefore scarier.",8
"I just saw Stranger Things and I liked it. Stranger Things is a new Netflix mini-series set in the early 1980s. The first season deals with the mysterious disappearance of a little boy named Will, a sinister government organization and a little girl with psychic powers.It's good to see Winona Ryder in something big again. I know she has been in other things but I haven't paid much attention since Girl Interrupted. That was the last Winona Ryder movie I can recall watching.It truly felt like something from the 1980s, from the music to the sets. It also had the right ambiance- that particular style of Gothic atmosphere that recent horror has lost. It felt like a 1980s science fiction / horror / fantasy with a bit of mystery. Unlike American Horror Story it did not rely heavily on gore or sex. You could have convinced me it was made in the 1980s.Since Stranger Things was so successful I hope other horror and scifi projects imitate it. I often hate when something popular is leeched but this is a style of film making I had missed.Noticeable Homages and references: Stand by Me / The Body, Firestarter, Carrie, The Shining, Stephen King's It, Sometimes They Come back, Poltergeist, The Thing, H. P. Lovecraft, Star Wars, E.T: the Extraterrestrial, Dungeons and Dragons, The Hobbit, Lord of the Rings, Evil Dead, The Twilight Zone (two episodes: The Monsters are due on Maple Street and Little Girl Lost), Nightmare on Elm Street, Watcher in the Woods, and even Let the Right One In (The girl going by the name El (short for Eleven) and how The Bullies were handled).The one thing that I felt made Stranger Things shine above American Horror Story is that Stranger Things is not excessively sexual or gory. It has just enough gore where the gruesome scenes do horrify you and stick with you but there is also a subtlety so that your imagination can take over and you do not become desensitized to things. You actually form an emotional connection to the characters and care what will happen to them. There's also enough mystery left to make you hungry for more and for your imagination to run wild about certain details.I liked it a lot. My one complaint has to do with the flicker light effect in the very first scene and later in high abundance in the final episode. I do NOT recommend anyone with Epilepsy watching Stranger Things, at least not the first scene of the first episode or large parts of the season finale. I'm somewhat photosensitive myself (though I don't have seizures from it) and I was bothered by the constant flashing in the final episode, I say this as someone who does NOT have epilepsy, I know it would be far worse for those of you that do have the condition. The first scene was bearable though it was a relief when it was over with but the final episode's flickering lights was dragged on and on and on. They also had unnecessary jump scares and some wall ghost CGI that unfortunately reminded me that yes, this was recently made (and would have looked better entirely done with practical effects). But otherwise I loved it.I recommend Stranger Things to anyone who likes 1980s horror, scifi or fantasy. If you miss traditional horror in a semi-modern setting this is the show for you. I personally would have preferred more supernatural / fantasy elements as opposed to the X-Files-esque pure Science fiction but I found it likable. There are lot of classic tropes and clichés that some of us adore. And some of the tropes are turned on their head- like expecting the one character to end up with the girlfriend of the bully, or that bully showing he actually has depth and can grow as a person. That one, in particular, was a wonderful and welcome twist on the 1980s film stereotype. I liked Stranger Things and I hope it's second season is equally enjoyable.",8
"First off, I'm going to say that I did enjoy the show. The acting was good, the music was top notch, and the cinematography was great! So why did I give it a 7/10? Quite simply it's plot is simplistic, it isn't that scary or suspenseful when it claims to be and I found the majority of the characters bland. I only really cared about the cop, Jim Hopper and the kid, Dustin. Everyone else wasn't really given a second thought until they reappeared on screen.At some points I forgot the plot was about the main group of kids trying to find out what happened to their friend as it ping-ponged around between the characters so much, I actually got a headache, and this is coming from someone who understood the ending to BioShock: Infinite.When you break it down, the story is mainly driven by nostalgia, a lot of it will go over people's heads who weren't born in the 70s/early 80s. And when there were subplots, I felt like they were somewhat unnecessary and/or executed poorly. For example, Nancy's motivation. After her friend Barbara disappears, she starts her own investigation along with Jonathan Byers. This (predictably) ends with a form of romantic tension which actually doesn't lead anywhere as Nancy stays with her actual boyfriend Steve (Who's for lack of a better term: A nob) who (Also predictably) does a somewhat lackluster heroic twist during a final confrontation by assisting Nancy and Jonathan against the... monsterThis is another down-point for me, not only do they make the mistake (Mistake in my eyes, it can be done well) of revealing the monster in it's fullest. It's also a generic black Wendigo-ish design with a head that opens like a dog from Resident Evil. Set in a story where they try and make everything suspenseful, they just go ahead and show you the beast. The best form of horror is when the audience fabricates the monster themselves, let us hear it, see a sudden silhouette move in the background, let us see their destruction, but don't let us see THEM.All in all, you should give this a watch, it's a good summer binge. Easily done in one sitting. It's enjoyable, in some instances, fun. But it's simply over-hyped and overrated when it comes to it's praise. Like I said, it's main drive is nostalgia which doesn't sit well with me.This reason this review covered mainly negative aspects of the show is because, as it's a *Spoiler Review* I'm assuming you've already watched it and are therefore in other peoples opinions on the show. You've probably heard all the praise in the world for it, hence my recommendation of the show, but cover the negatives.",8
"Stranger Things is a original Netflix series. Expetations were high and hype was real. Well, Netlfix truly nailed it and this was worth of hype. This series had elements of E.T, X-Files, Twin Peaks, Stand By Me and many 80s high school movies. Great mixture and true nostalgia trip to the 80s. I have always been a very special relationship with sci-fi and horror so I think that's why I liked this so much. This is like a Spielberg style adventure and Stephen King style horror. Yep this show is sometimes very terrifying and not for the little kids.One of the biggest makers of Stranger Thing's awesomeness are truly spectacular acting performanes. This is like Game of Thrones. Everyone do breathtaking work to adults to the kids. I have to mention that I strongly believe that Millie Bobby Brown (who plays Eleven) will be a huge star in the future. Also David Harbour (who plays Hopper) is amazing. And everyone else. Winona Ryder makes a huge comeback to the top and this is her best performance in a long long time.I loved this show and i can't wait to see second season. English is not my mother tongue so sorry for possibly few mistakes.",10
"Only saw the first episode and was floored. Had to review this!Story is awesome and the characters are freaking good. I mean for everyone that has watched anything they know how bad child actors are from the Walking Dead to the strain and basically every other show where there is a child actor... not here, i mean, they were freaking awesome. It is been so long with Carls and Maxes and whatever other **** child actors.Then there are the the props and direction, it is like watching a genuine freaking 80s stuff.so freaking good! max thumbs, tomatoes, freshness, whatever! bye",10
"**** May contain strong spoilers ****Review made most out of episode 1.So. After about 2 years of conveying from a friend of mine (you know who you are) I finally got the interest up for watching a series. I turned it on. If you like me were around 10 years of age you certainly will see and experience things (stranger things? pun? Yeah!) in this one. After just a couple of minutes I recognize so much that I just were astonished. - The opening scene; the font as taken from McGyver or something. Spot on! - A doctor escapes a laboratory... a lethal hunt. - A gang of teenagers (see Goonies, E.T. and Stand By Me) in a role playing game. Dungeons and Dragons... here I come! - On the wall besides the game: a poster of the movie ""The Thing"" with Kurt Russell. (In episode 2; watch the wall as the guys is listening to Clash; there, the poster of Evil Dead!) - They all ride bikes with big light bulbs... hilarious! (Back to Goonies...?) I even got a bike with a long seat like the one in here. And... Ralph Macchio in ""The Karate Kid"" - A boy running away into the woods from some kind of monster. Cut to forest with a lot of...yes, that is correct; fog, fog and fog. Brings back memories from the horror movies in the eighties. - The music as the kids leaves on bikes brings memories back from the music era... and also into the game of ""The Last Ninja"" (first stage ""Into the Wilderness""... just listen on the synthesizers! Marvellous!) - A desperate and ""horrorfying"" situation with a phone... of course occupied on the other line and... yes.... dropping the old phone just hanging by the thread. All above in the first episode before the proper introduction come in play. - The introduction with the red neon lights and the music pushing the cast forward... wow... put me right into the movie of Manhunter and a nod to Michael Mann! - A strong ""filmatic and movie-ish"" strobe effect on the entire production and editing! Oh... give me back my child heroes! The Goonies... Sloth....were are you!? - My first big laugh: about 13 minutes into Stranger Things, episode 1. In the movie ""The Goonies"", there is Chunk. He has to do the dance before being let inside the house. Everybody is laughing. Here, the guy in the hat does the ""arm thing"", as a nod to Chunk! The character of Mike... like ""Hey, Mikey!"" in The Goonies! Excellent! - Oh...28 minutes into episode 1: ""Tickets to Poltergeist!"" Bazinga! Oh...sorry, I meant bullseye! - In The Goonies, when they find One Eyed Willy; the music is played out gently. Listen to that and listen to the keyboard sounds at 40:35 in episode 1. - Being personal here; I am a huge (and 62 exclamation marks) fan of the global phenomenon of the epic rock group TOTO (that also made Michael Jacksons ""Thriller"" around 1983, as for the year of ""Stranger Things""). And... voilá! 42 minutes into episode 1: ""It's gonna take some time to do the things we never had"". Magic... true magic! Like David Copperfield from 1983 touched the production there! Time: 42 minutes and 59 seconds; ""You're beautiful, Nancy Wheeler!"" and right into ""It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you..."" Then ""I bless the rains down in Africa..."", and cut to the rain outside of the house! Goosebumps, clap, clap, clap...goosebumps, clap, clap, clap! Wonderful screenplay, epic screen writing and a really fine moment of movie magic! - Episode 4; bad place... Sweden...sub zero! Laughed so hard!Keep your eyes open for references... Moments of Twin Peaks and Halloween. I am back into the eighties! Thank You, Matt and Ross Duffer!Over to the series as a product: - The production : Let me use an over used word: awesome! The music, the soundtrack, the sound effects, the camera angles, the costumes and clothes, the environment, the surroundings, the bicycles, the language, the phrases and slang... properly in place and genius! Hats off to this one! The title ""Stranger Things""... a better and more suited title would have made the production more rounded up. - The actors : Winona Ryder; question mark? Well... why Winona? I had preferred some other more intense and in depth actress. The rest of the cast is all in place, is delivering and that in a nice and great way. They all got their clear parts, and they sell it to the crowd and viewers. David Harbour is grasping the role perfectly; a tormented father that lost his daughter and now is the head of the town police. Slow and heavy, produced a solid character there, David Harbour! Matthew Modine evolves in the character and creates a both mysterious and dangerous role. - Entertainment : Starts off in a slow pace... mysterious...fiction...horror... nostalgia... and... boom! You are right in the middle of the story. Excellent entertainment. - Age : 11 or 15, depends of the company and the maturity of the individual.8,6 out of 10.",9
"I could probably nitpick, but why bother, this is about as near perfect as film gets.I just call this ""film"", because traditional ""box office"" is dead. Cable (and apparently Netflix) is where motion picture entertainment is at. Box office just serves superhero comics and pseudo-artsy, vapid star appearances. ""Oooh, Leonardo DiCaprio has a beard, that sounds interesting!"". No, thank you, Hollywood.But there was a time when Hollywood was awesome, and Stranger Things extracts all that awesomeness, makes it fresh again, and presents it in a modern, appropriate format. With so many classic influences (I wont try to re-list all of them), it sound like it would be a mess of different genres, but it all really works perfectly together with this story and sci-fi-ish angle. I was expecting something convoluted, but the plot is straightforward and well-explained.The kids were so much better than the usual kid characters. Dustin was funny. 011 was serious (as someone waiting my whole life for a live-action Akira movie, this character gave me goosebumps). Luke reminded me of all my 80's childhood friends who aspired to be action heroes. And, as a side note - most movies today where you have characters of different races, they always have to have some banter acknowledging some racial tension - remember the 80s, when we didn't feel the need for that crap? Winona Ryder is criticized for being too this or too that - but this was a difficult role to play as a character experiencing things nobody can relate to. I thought she did awesome. The Chief of Police perfectly transitions from a typical, believable cop into an action hero you have to root for.It felt like this script was probably intended for a box-office movie, but they decided two hours is just not enough time to tell the story. Im glad it was made in the format it was, it was just perfect. So perfect, in fact, that I'm not looking forward to how they're going to ruin this masterpiece with a season 2. It is a complete story, and I don't feel the need for continuation. But, it looks like they know what they're doing, and I'll end up watching it either way.",10
"Adventurous plot and the acting is done well, however, with the exception of Rider, Barbour, and one of the child actors, very little sympathy can be garnered for the other characters....the over acting and unbelievable over the top behavior breaks the sense of reality the writers hoped to accomplish....problems with the plot development. Secondary plot involving teen love is weak which dilutes the primary premise. The artistic license inventing the risks that the characters is not plausible leaving the viewer with a sense of frustration trying to reconcile the behavior leaving one to loose empathy for all the characters....very unrealistic. It a shame that the actors were saddled with a plot that nearly trumps their attempts to pul it off.Too bad...it could have been a winner.",5
"This show got me hooked right from the get go and after binge watching it and the re watching it again it still is an amazing programme.The story-line this show has is probably one of the best ones at the moment as it makes sense and isn't confusing to watch, I haven't seen a show that has gripped me as much as this one did so quickly and that it didn't take forever to get an answer as well made this show perfect for me to watch.The way this show has been made and the effects and visuals honestly were amazing to watch each and every episode, the art work in this was amazing.I honestly hope they are making another series of this as I love every second of it.",10
"For a few weeks now, Stranger Things, Netflix's newest ""original"" series has received the kind of buzz that only a new Netflix show can seem to manage these days. It's been recommended to me by just about everyone, and when I finally sat down to watch it, I found myself in a really weird mixed head space. Because at the core of it, I love the show. There is so much to praise it for. But after every episode, I found myself wondering, often times aloud and to anyone who would listen, why it works. Because I can't seem to get around the notion that it absolutely should not work.for my full review, visit https://barrysreview.wordpress.com/2016/08/15/stranger-things/",8
"A homage to every 80s movie you could possibly think of, Stranger Things nevertheless stands up as an enjoyable and satisfying piece of work in its own right.Most of the characters in the show are interesting and well-acted. Central to the story is a group of somewhat nerdy young friends, who behave and interact like real kids. It's absolutely delightful watching them navigating their way through the bizarre story.The episodes are shot extremely well, and the directors keep an excellent grip on the tone throughout, which manages to intermingle tension, creepiness and light-heartedness seamlessly.However, this show has received somewhat over-exuberant praise. The show does not simply nod towards previous horror/sci-fi works - it actively recycles elements to such an extent that very little here can be claimed as original. Furthermore (without wishing to spoil the plot), the mystery which is revealed to underpin the plot is somewhat shallow. The 'bad guys', such as they are, are neither nuanced or fleshed-out and the viewers are left with absolutely no interest in them. Although the show successfully reaches a satisfying narrative conclusion within its eight episodes, ultimately there's nothing very complex here.This is well-made sci-fi/horror which is absolutely delightful and charming to watch, whilst also being creepy, tense and gripping. It can be appreciated by people without any interest in the 80s nostalgia indulgence with which the show is associated (most of all, it reminded me of the more recent series Fringe). Lovers of good film and TV will enjoy watching this, but a 'masterpiece' it is not.",8
"That isn't a Stephen King series!!!!I was actually shocked that the great author wasn't involved in this show, everything about it SCREAMS Stephen King!The opening title is font from his paperbacks and there are references to his books through out from fear of clowns to the books actually making cameo! The style will remind you of the mini-series for the book (IT).... A lot!I generally don't like child actors but the Duffer brothers made it work!The series is set in the 80's with all the geeky references from your childhood, the one thing they got ""wrong"" was using modern music sometimes, I think it's a subtle reminder that you are indeed watching something new.Once you start watching you'll get hooked! it's impossible not to! A good thriller with an intense story line, believable dialogue and interesting characters.This is probably more Stephen King then his actual work!",9
"Seriously loved this series.First off let's be honest, I'm an 80's man, so this gelled with me with ease.Even the guys who do the soundtrack are fantastic. The author, the musicians the director, the actors. This combination combines to form something which has been lacking for a long time. Something that get's me and that's appealing to both children and adults.This connected with me in so many ways and is off to an absolutely amazing start. I can't wait to see what happens next.The first season is in the vein of Steven Speilbergs Super 8, which was also one of the best movies he's ever done in my firm opinion.This series is like ET for a new generation with the added bonus it's set in an age that eliminates computers and mobile phones everywhere. An age were people connected and actually made friends, not just associates who keep them from there screens.Seriously fun, amazingly chilling and superbly atmospheric. I can't recommend it enough if you grew up with ET and loved 'Super 8'. If so, then your in for a treat. If not, then perhaps you'll find some new magic in story telling.",10
"It's silent hill, slender man and ET all combined. I love horror flicks and this series is amazing! This is a drama suspense horror series and one of my top favorites. Whoever Rates this below an 8 doesn't know what they're talking about or didn't really watch it and give it the respect it deserves. When I started the series I could not stop, I watched the full series in on day. What can I say the acting and the whole cast was brilliant. I enjoyed it, I hope there's another season. I also hope the second season is good as the first one or even better. I just don't see how anything can be as good as the first one, but it would be awesome if they could keep it up. The casting, director and the producer were amazing.. great job Netflix!",10
"The acting and the settings are awesome, I agree, but let's be honest, if this was not on Netflix, nobody would talk about it. It is not scary and I don't like horrors too much, and the plot with the kids seems very childish. It's not boring, but sometimes trying to be too atmospheric and it gets annoying with the blinking lights etc. I don't know, it was not bad, but I know about tons of better series. I feel like very little thing around the main plot is nailed, the atmosphere is awesome, but the plot itself seems average. I hate some parts with the kids, where it all seems forced, and the ending was very predictable. 7/10 is what I would give it.",7
"The quality of the series is exceptional, everyone agrees on that. Filming, actors, all the things you can see are of the best quality.But today we have access to information, and don't believe in supernatural stories anymore, things we didn't know 20 years ago.So there's no point in cultivating theories long gone, not even for fun. I'm sure there are many good real world stories to be told. Most people live in a world of fantasy and will like the series.The series are cute, but just pure fantasy. If you came here for recommendation, as a rational person, I recommend not to watch, even though it's like The Goonies. Still not good enough.I hope that Netflix and others make more series on this 80's style, but with a proper story. 6 out of 10. Watchable once.",6
"I've read the reviews - not all but enough. I've heard my friends talk about it. I was curious so even though I wasn't even remotely interested I decided to watch an episode. What I got was...""stranger things.""Wow. This show is so lame. I've heard people say it has the same atmosphere and feel from the 80's. It doesn't. They say it's like the new ""stand by me"" it's not. They say the kids are going on an adventure..maybe they are - but the adventure sucks. How do I know? I grew up in the 80's. I'm an 80's baby. This show sucks.The story line doesn't make me want watch another episode..it's like watching the X-Files when Chris Carter just gave up and started making those episodes with HUMOUR.Stranger things isn't scary, it isn't funny, it isn't interesting, it isn't anything new. The most interesting part of the show is the little girl and unfortunately the show is just so lame, I can't spend the time to figure out what happened to her because I just don't care.There are so many good shows and if you want to watch one with paranormal activity then watch Outcast on HBO. Now that's a show for an adult with drama instead of this PG13 trash.I'm not sure why people like this show..but it definitely doesn't get a 10..and Netflix did not ""do it again"" or ""get it right"" or ""bring real TV back"" or ""hit it out of the park""",1
"This show is really great. It got my attention right away and I couldn't stop watching it, I finished the season in one day and cannot wait for the Duffer brothers to come up with season 2.The kids are really good actors and they sure do keep you gripped to the show.It's based in the 80s and was influenced by Steven Spielberg and Stephen King which I realized after watching a few episodes before I read it online. It has great soundtracks and really good cinematography shots.It's really cool how this Netflix series has gotten so much attention and great reviews. If you have not started watching, you definitely should get to it asap.",9
"This is one of the series you have to watch. It feels like an old movie from Spielberg like E.T. or has a touch of Super 8. We we're totally hooked from the first Episode and couldn't stop watching it. Finally something else on the TV.If you love 80's style and mystery you're gonna love this show. The kids are acting superb and the effects are gorgeous. It makes you feel like a kid again, you can feel the tension between friendship and the action you always wanted as a kid. It sucks you right into their lives and stories.Love it!",9
"I found that I didn't really enjoy this series as much as I was hoping to.It was obvious the creators had put a LOT of thought into the entire thing, it really shows, but if their intention was to create a show aside from the whole '80s thing, a lot of the effort was misplaced.While it does do a great job of being an '80s homage, if that's not something you're already excited by, this show may be a little disappointing. While interesting to see an '80s world on TV ~30 years after the '80s, if you don't really care about the '80s that much or have a heap of nostalgia for it, it may feel like the show is dragging on a little.I will say that this eases up after the first 2-3 episodes, and a lot of this could be regarded as ""World building"" or ""Setting up the plot"", but a lot of it DOESN'T contribute to the plot, and as such, it feels like there's someone following you around saying ""... hey.... guess what..... this show's set in the '80s."" in literally every moment of every scene.While I enjoyed the final 2 episodes very much, I feel like the things that occurred in the plot would have had just as much impact with about half of the build up... in about every story line that was followed. I also feel like it would have played into the whole '80s homage a lot more if there was much more ""Spielberg Kiddie Flick"" action outside the final 2 episodes as well.One thing I will commend the writers on is the characters themselves. Unlike the plot, the balance between character and '80s trope has a really good balance, with the joys of modern standards written in really well. No character is overly stupid or overly smart, they're all stereotypes of another era, but they very rarely actually feel cliché or annoying. Props to them for that! Probably one of my favourite viewings in regards to characters.In the end, I did enjoy it, but with much of the plot ignored for nostalgia-tugging, I don't feel this is as much of a watch as others are saying it is.",7
"Well, I don't think I wasted my time when I decided to watch this show. It was interesting, it was good and it brought something new. But to be honest, I saw the other comments about it before watching and now I can say it is not THAT good. Sometimes it is slow, sometimes it is not logical, sometimes it is just another Teen Show and there are many clichés. It was a good entertainment but it was not a surprising show, it didn't make me anxious for the finale and for the result as some other series did. It was possible to predict many things that happened, so I was rarely surprised by the way the plot went. So, you can watch it, but don't expect a 9,1 TV Show (The rate this moment).",7
"Stranger Things is a sci-fi horror series on Netflix created by the Duffer Brothers (Wayward Pines). I had been hearing nothing but praise for this eight part series from friends and family, and now I know why. It is a clever tribute to movies and TV series of the 80s.In the small town of Hawkins, Indiana, in the year 1983, 12-year-old Will Byers (Noah Schnapp) mysteriously disappears one night. Will's mother Joyce (Winona Ryder), police chief Jim Hopper (David Harbour), and his three friends Mike (Finn Wolfhard), Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) and Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin) set out to search for where he could have gone. To make matters more complicated, a strange girl with psychokinetic powers is discovered by Will's friends the following day. Could she hold the key to where Will may have vanished?The series plays out as an affectionate homage to all the stereotypes and tropes of 1980s films such as E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial, Stand By Me and The Lost Boys. The theme song itself sounds like something composed by Director John Carpenter. I really enjoyed the sense of mystery and suspenseful atmosphere that was emanating throughout each episode. I must give credit to the Duffer Brothers for the way they were able to capture the overall feel of an 80s movie. The acting was great as well, especially from all of the child actors and Winona Ryder. I just hope the series will be picked up for a second season.I rate the first season 8.5/10.",9
"In India, Netflix isn't a phenomenon that people would have easy access to and we only hear of good shows either by word of mouth or social media. Thanks to FB for propagating heavily on 'Stranger Things'. Read few lines about the show and browsed through IMDb to know all that could feed my interest. Finally started watching it online couple of days back and already started with the fifth episode. Honestly, I never thought there could be a show to hook me like TWD did. From the performances, to actors and the whole environment of the show is what you need after very decade or two to take you back to the good old days of fantastical childhood. As much as it has been said, the show kept reminding me of Goonies and ET and Super 8 and Stephen King and Steven Spielberg and blah blah. I can only thank Duffer Brothers for not being shortlisted to direct the new 'IT' film or this jewel of a show would have taken more time to come to us. It has a sense of sweetness, calmness and dread and thrill at the same time. There is something about 80s that never gets old and looks even better on screen. After I am finished watching it, I am definitely doing a marathon of it for Halloween with dim lights and my pumpkin pie.For those who are still contemplating about it, just don't wait and try watching the first episode. I promise, you would be glued to it like I am and many others.",10
"Stranger Things an ambitious project by the Duffer Brothers finally brought to life by Netflix after being rejected by every single network approached deserves the feverish viral status it has received. As a 32 year old I avidly watch Game of Thrones, Sherlock and many other shows which many consider to be the best of the decade but none have moved me so far as Stranger things has. In an amazing story line the Duffer brothers make you glue your eyes to the screen and hurriedly click next episode as soon as one finishes. While managing to bring three different stories with 3 unique genre styles the show manages to embrace you for 8 sweet hours before gently laying you back into the real world feeling anguished that you cannot relive it again. Despite loving shows like Band of Brothers, Breaking Bad never before has a show been so gripping that I would watch it 2 in a row in the space of 3 days. Even while writing this I feel the need to go back to Netflix and watch it again. Acting and filmography are top notch with absolute stellar from the main actors who are children which is extremely rare nowadays. It was also an added pleasure to see Winona Ryder return to the screen anchoring this show with top notch acting. If I could rate this show higher than 10/10 I would as I know this will most likely stay in my top ten go to shows for suggestions for a long long time.",10
"Okay, unless you are a millennial or younger, you can't help but notice the aesthetic allusions in Stranger Things to classic 80's works such as Altered States,E.T, Firestarter, Red Dawn, and Aliens. Not to mention borrowing thematic story elements from The X-files (including the theme music), as well as your choice of 80's teen angst drama. But the sum of the parts definitely adds up to a warm and cozy familiar feeling in this series not seen since those heady days when computer technology first impacted the culture en mass.In this review, I was going to warn of spoilers, but I have rescinded that idea because I am only going to talk about one story line that was completely unnecessary, misguided, and ultimately abandoned by the writers. What about Barbara? She is the second victim in this mystery, but she is given short shrift by the whole town, who are focused solely on finding/saving the young boy. By including that story line, and then essentially foregoing it, it really made the rest of the characters (save Nancy) seem morally duplicitous. Why even include it? I suppose there was only so much story to cram into 8 episodes, so something had to give, but it just should have been written out completely from the start.",7
"Stranger Things is a very well-made show. The acting is fantastic (especially from the children), it's cinematography is beautiful and it's great at creating a feeling of dread.By all means, Stranger Things should be phenomenal, but it has one huge flaw, a flaw which I believe derails the show.The Duffer Brothers claim the show is a love-letter to 80s Sci-Fi. After watching this show, I can confirm that The Duffer Brothers have no idea what a homage is.A homage shows respect to a previous decade/genre, but Stranger Things doesn't do that. Stranger Things goes the Scary Movie/Seth MacFarlane route of excessively referencing other works. This wouldn't be such a problem if the references weren't so blatant or frequent.The show loves to name drop (""Maybe she's an escaped loony?"" ""Just like Michael Myers!"", ""I was making out with Chrissy Carpenter.), place movie posters in the background or foreground (The Thing, The Evil Dead) or sometimes even lift scenes directly from other works (The scene where Mike hides Eleven from his mother is almost identical to a scene in E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial).Stranger Things feels like it was created by that one annoying kid everybody knew who thought he was so cool because he had some knowledge of popular culture before his time.A big disappointment for somebody who was hoping for a lot more.",6
"Those who criticize the show stating that it lacks originality are right - it's yet another scary story about a monster hunting residents of a small town. But if you serve this unoriginal plot in a way it has been served by the Duffer brothers, the results is pretty amazing. The soundtrack, which accompanies most of the key moments of each episode, doesn't let you forget that the action takes place in the 1980s, and in my opinion it is one of the most important factors that makes the show great. Another advantage is the way all the key characters are set up. In the very first episode we can get to know their personalities due to an amazing performance of the exceptionally talented actors and the witty dialogues between them. I've never thought I'd be into that type of show but I'm more than happy that gave it a try.",10
I never write reviews here.But this show deserves one!It is great to see something that is being produced today that gives you that real feeling that you had when you watched movies in the 80's or 90's. No filters no extreme computer animation just this raw movie feeling. I always like to compare this to the first Die Hard movies. Because they gave me this feeling to.The show itself is amazing good acting and a truly great story. An absolute must for everyone that likes mystery and Syfy.I hope that more movies and series in the future go back to this old school style / technique.,10
"I'm a sucker for 80s nostalgia, so I was excited when I heard about Stranger Things. The show is a homage to the movies and books of that decade, with references to Stand By Me, The Goonies, E.T., Poltergeist, Nightmare on Elm Street, Alien, Commando, among many others. It's good, thrilling popcorn entertainment that, no, is not the best series ever created, but does the job of keeping you entertained and interested.The one thing I really like about this series is how humanized all the main characters are. You have the four main protagonists, geeky preteen boys who live by the codes of the comic books they read. They communicate on walkie talkies, transport themselves on dirt bikes, snack on pudding, and basically know all the ""secret spots"" of their Anytown USA setting. You have the ""little miss perfect"" older sister who rebels for the first time and dates the popular jock. You have the divorced mother who is barely keeping it together while raising her two sons. You have the older brother who doesn't trust authority. You have the moody cop who hates his current life. Then, of course, you have Eleven (""El""), the superhuman little girl who wants a normal life and some Eggos. The acting is actually very well done and you immediately grow to like all the characters, except maybe the bullies.I do have a few bones to pick. One, some of the writing is weak and not fully flushed out, resulting in stories not going anywhere, some disappearing without notice, and others slightly corny and clichéd, which at times can be charming (this is suppose to be the 80s, after all), and other times eye rolling. Also, some of the action seems anti-climatic, with resolutions seemingly way too easy. The other thing too is the show toes a thin line between homage and plagiarism. I think for the most part it keeps the balance, but some parts it gets dangerously close. I also have some concerns of this going another season. This seems more mini-series than not, but I'm curious as what direction the show will go in the new season. Will it be the same story and characters? Same characters and new story? New stories and new characters? I guess we wait and see.Overall, Netflix put together a great summer series. Heat warming, thrilling, nostalgic, I wish we could find that creativity of Spielberg, King, Craven and Lucas, among others, of the 80s that resulted in some of the most original work out there instead of superhero and remakes over and over.",7
"We are in the 80s, in the small American town of Hawking, when Will Byers (Noah Schnapp) mysteriously disappears. In the meantime a little girl (Millie Bobby Brown) without a name is found by Mike Wheeler (Finn Wolfhard). All of these events seem to be connected and what starts as a simple missing person case slowly evolves into creating a chain of events that will find Hawking's police chief Jim Hopper (David Harbour) joining forces with Will's mother Joyce (Winona Ryder) to uncover what is really going on.Admittedly, that plot synopsis doesn't cover even half of it, but there is no need to know anything going into this, I went in without having literally any idea what this was going to be and, just like the rest of the world, ""Stranger Things"" caught me deeply and by surprise. I was not expecting the best season of television I have seen in the last years.This is incredible storytelling, this is the next big thing, a voice so original and unique you are swept away by the power of the emotional narrative. I will quote a sentence that sums up the show so perfectly it is hard not to bring it up: ""in Stranger Things the kids are in a Spielberg film, the teens in a Carpenter film and the adults are in a Stephen King film"". That basically outlines the brilliance of the show in one sentence. The molding of tones and atmospheres is seamless, at no point I felt like the creators were bluntly copying off of any of their inspirations.Many have talked about how this show is such an homage to the 80s and the storytellers of that time, but I think that that comes into play only as a consequence of the storytelling, which is why it works. The first thing these writers worry about nailing is the characters and what an incredible ensemble we are presented to. There are no stereotypes, no clichés, no archetypal figures, every single on of these people is three dimensional, we get behind every character, we believe in their world and we root for them. The complexity of the dynamics that is brought to life with such clarity is indicative of the evident passion the creators had for this project.The scene weave is just unbelievable, how plot and story manage to forward each other, building a building a narrative that grows and culminates in a beautiful resolution which once again avoids any type of predictions and presents itself as original as the whole series. Anyone accusing the writers of having excessively borrowed from the 80s is only trying to bit*h around. The originality of the series is unbelievable and it is sure to produce a great deal of imitators, just as every time such a new and fresh voice comes to life.The writing merits here are off the charts, definitely something worth studying, and the directors deserve deep recognition for how brilliantly and completely the vision on the page is brought to the screen. The cinematography is so stylish, it molds 80s dynamics with modern technology without ever calling attention to itself. The score and soundtrack could not have been more spot on. The theme of the show encapsulates perfectly what the whole thing is about, it nails it down perfectly and when that theme is heard for the first time you will know you are in for something special.What it also comes down to is how powerful the themes explored are thanks to a story world that lends itself so brilliantly to them. This is one of the best portrayed friendships of recent years, but the themes go well beyond that. The power of love over hate is a theme that is carried over into all of the story lines and has different manifestations in all of them and when they are all brought together the impact on the viewer is truly special. Other than being so smart and affectionate, the series was probably most memorable for me for how moving it was in its small yet powerful moments.And we haven't even started talking about the actors yet. Whilst every single one of them deserves loads of praise on his or her own, for me the scene stealer is hands down David Harbour. I did not know he was this good of an actor, this is world class acting. He brings to life a character, subverting every possible expectation we had about him and ultimately creating a person that feels incredibly real. The only complaint I have is that Winona Ryder struggled through the first half of the show being very one note and giving a flat portrayal of her struggles.""Stranger Things"" was incredible, it was overwhelming in its originality and whilst I am still not sure on whether I want a season two or not, I will forever cherish the experience I had with this treasure of a tale.",5
"You must be out of your mind to miss this.If you grew in the 80's then this brings you back to those cool times playing with your mates, building dens and just being out doors. No phones no internet. Really listening to music.To those of you who missed the 80's this says it all. Obviously our monsters weren't as real.The feel of this series is great, brilliant story lines keeping you hooked at every corner. Perfectly cast.I've just watched episode 7 and not once through the series so far have I reached to check my phone to look at crap I don't really need.Oh how I wish I was back in the 80's. We had style.Love little mum dent",10
"I watched the whole series with great disappointment. The acting was bad, the script very amateur, the sound/noise very irritating, the cinematography horrible, the story weak and confusing, and the whole thing just a mess. I kept watching all eight episodes thinking that based on all the rave reviews surely there was something I was missing here. I think this might be among the worst TV series I have ever watched. I had heard the Duffer brothers interviewed on NPR's ""All Things Considered"" and I was drawn in thinking this was going to be great. I need to exorcise this somehow from my weekend. It was a waste of time and looking back painful to watch. I realize people have different tastes and clearly many people love this series but I honestly have to differ and can not recommend it at all, even on a very boring day with nothing else to do.",1
"Wow... I would like to start this review with a Wow. Why? Because it is a amazing series! Every minute of the series is just perfect!I love the style of the 80's. I did not grew up in the 80's or something but if i see the series, i would like to grew up at that time. The anger the communism gave and things, i like the temper.Also the casting for this series is phenomenal, i mean i never saw a group of young children act like this, it was so good. And to be honest i have a little crush on the older sister Nancy, because holy mama she looks good!This series comes close to my all time favorite Twin Peaks. Twin peaks is still my favorite because of the fact that Twin Peaks did make me lose some sleep at night and Stranger Things doesn't do that with me. But overall i would like to thank Netflix for the amazing series they made.",10
"I wanted to watch this show I had read so much about. I knew that reading the raving positive reviews would probably ruin it for me, I entered the upside-down with an open mind. It started off nice, set the story and characters firmly in place and proceeded on a constant slow pace, developing certain characters and story-lines all along until the end. What got me hooked on though was the mystery of it all and how the show will tie up the individual character stories. It did an okay job in that department and I feel like it could've been so much more. The overall story stood mediocre but gripping, throughout the eight episodes. Some of the characters introduced were unnecessary. Winona Ryder's, and the kids' acting was over the top at some points while David Harbour was a rock, perfect fit for the role. For a story based in the 80's, the slang that the kids use felt out of place, like the show's music. While I enjoyed the show, it left me feeling like I was missing out on something. People I know were going crazy about it and I just thought it was okay. Maybe I shouldn't have read the reviews beforehand, but the show needed a bit more work on the story and dialogue to be termed as ""Masterclass"".My Rating: 7/10 +1 for nostalgia. ""Should I stay or should I go""",7
"Wow, anyone who has seen Winona Ryder act over the years would agree she is a good actor.But in this series she is incredible.I believe this is the best work of her career.She plays the character so convincingly, and so completely that it just draws you into the entire premise of the series.The other actors do a great job too. I'd say 8-9/10.Overall, a fantastic series. Great work funding this Netflix!Every episode gets better and better.The other actors who are outstanding are the boys in the Goonies gang. Equally convincing.A top series.",10
"Stranger Things is a witty, affectionate and nostalgic look back at the 80s horror/brat pack movie. Geeky kids on a mission to rescue their friend, adults who are deliberately colourless or non-existent parents (Winina Ryder excepted) or alternatively evil men in suits. Hazmat or business, suits are not to be trusted. White coats are also to be avoided. And avoid they do - on bikes of course - with a little help from a special power. Sound familiar? The parallels with ET are obvious but references to cult 80s movie abound - the evil force in the parallel universe (Poltergeist), the search that follows the train tracks (Stand by Me), the jock vs geek teen love interest (Heathers, Pretty in Pink) and maybe a nod to the smoky hallway finale in Assault on Precinct 13. Stranger Things is an entertaining ride - just the right amount of shock - and the kids as main protagonists is engaging without being cringe worthy. No doubt some will point out that kids avoiding baddies on bikes is unlikely and unrealistic, that no one can hide a superpower in their basement den for days on end without the parents knowing. Well, they did it in the 80s so it must be possible and frankly who cares if it's not. It was fun. If this was the 80s the soundtrack album would be a killer - The Clash, Echo and the Bunnymen, Joy Division, New Order. A thoroughly enjoyable trip down memory lane and an affectionate punch (look it up).",8
"This show really deserves 12 stars, not 10, for brilliance in every category. Spielberg fans will recognize lots of references to ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" ""E.T.,"" and J.J. Abrams' ""Super 8"" (itself a huge Spielberg reference), but this is a good thing. Humankind's fear of the dark probably dates back to before shadows flickered at the edges of nighttime campfires in the mouths of caves, and ""Stranger Things"" exploits that fear masterfully. The story combines fear, horror, loss, different kinds of love, and the right amount of heart into a perfectly balanced mixture. Then when you are sure you know what will happen in the next shot, a twist surprises you.Television does not get better than this: there is not an ounce of fat anywhere in the storytelling; the editing is superb, especially the scene transitions; and the entire cast are fabulous. Winona Ryder, always a strong actress, does an outstanding job of portraying the emotional journey her character experiences, but everyone else is perfect in their roles as well -- the casting department deserves major kudos here.If you don't have a Netflix subscription, get one now. And settle in for a binge...and don't blink.",10
"This is a very bad show. The only way Im thinking people like this,is only if they are teens or so much younger than even that. Is not a good show for anyone who is over 22. There are some good parts, but the show has bad graphics and stupid children lines and the girl is just awful. Nothing is believable about it and everything is predictable . Don't watch it if u are over 22.U will love it if u are a teen or younger.I will definitely not watch season 2. P.s. don't get yourself fooled by the high IMDb note, i bet only teens voted most of that. The only good actor there is the mother and she is great for sure. Maybe if there were older kids, at least 18 or so, the show would have been great.",1
"The fantastic thing about this series is the children. Terrific, scene-stealing performances from all four of them. Nailed nerdy boys, abused girl, budding romance, and everything in-between.But the story itself -ugh? Derivative drivel. A federal institution with this level of interest is handled poorly by a small cadre of ""scientists."" If this kind of operation were to occur, it would be handled in a much more sophisticated manner, even back in the day. The kids out-running the police story device is not believable. Just too many warmed over tropes.Harbour's hard-bitten, sullen demeanor feels dialed in. Winona plays what seems to me a high-pitched parody of Owen Wilson. Neither of their performances moved me positively. Paired together they are almost believable. Even then, that they succeed where better trained personnel fail miserably is just sophomoric.The kids compel - the story is poor and the adults are merely staging.",3
"This is a mash-up of Goosebumps series, with a dash of cult and a generous flashback to the 80's. Reminds me of The Goonies. Reminds me of E.T. Reminds me of M83.It's confusing at first - I'm 33. So I can relate with everything here.One of the kid looks like Macaulay Culkin. Familiar. The chief is like a lovechild of young Jack Nicholson and Dexter (Michael C. Hall). Winona Ryder looks like Winona Ryder. ""Should I stay or should I go?"" and many other synth M83-like sound. Bald, adorable, bad-ass girl escaping from lab. The monster is ... basic monster you'd imagine whenever you read teen horror novels. Tacky and predictable ending.So I'm confuse whether this is for teenagers or adults like me.On the fair side - it's nice and entertaining. I like how I don't have to think too much and just enjoy those cute kids running around in the forest chasing monsters. Makes me miss my childhood and how I used to enjoy those cheesy Goosebumps serials.",6
"Imagine the nostalgic memories you may rekindle from films like E.T. and The Goonies. Now drop your happy memories into a dark ""Silent Hill"" dimension.Watching this show made we want to go back and rate every other title at 9 out of 10. This series knocked it out of the park.Thank you to The Duffer Brothers and Netflix for working to bring us fun piece of work.I hope if there is a season 2, it will survive expectations. This show really raised the bar IMHO.This series sent me on a 80's binge. Today's pick for viewing was ""flight of the navigator""",10
"I'll start right out with my reason for 8/10 as opposed to 10/10. In my personal opinion one thing all stories should explain especially mysteries is the how and why. The how and why is murky at best which left me feeling a bit confused about a few things.With that in mind, I watched this entire series in one day. For ten or so hours nothing mattered except bathroom breaks and snack refills. I kid you not, the very phrasing of the first chapter's title makes you feel like ""Ok we're going on a ride here"". Then there's the method they used to introduce the series title. Talk about a blast from the past! From then on, just be prepared to be transported to a different time. The set pieces alone are done well enough to give this a gander.One thing this series did well was mixing ""well known"" actors with people you literally never heard of. It has a great pull where the Winona Ryders reel you in and the new comers keep you there, knowing you don't have to see the same old style from the same old people, but also knowing you don't have to invest a lot of trust into a whole cast of newbies. The kids especially do a phenomenal job. While a bit cliché at times, considering their age, they were fantastic. You'll see almost immediately that Millie Bobby Brown is in a class of her own.Another thing I liked about this series considering it's a Netflix Original is that they didn't take advantage of the lack of censorship. There are no unnecessary sex scenes, every other word isn't a swear, and there's not a whole bunch of random drug use or killing. But not to the point where it seems like an after school special. It was simply done right.Now the general vibe of the series is very familiar as it pulls from just about every 80s sci-fi/horror movie you can think of. What they did well with that however is taking that familiarity and molding it into something new. I don't wanna get on a soapbox, but man was it nice to watch a movie about teenagers and not have it be them glued to their phones. I think whether anyone wants to admit it or not we all can use a break from the strangle hold social media has on us right now. Now that I think of it, I think that's why a lot of modern horror films don't work these days. Technology is all around us, so it's hard to suspend belief when you know that theoretically the entire world is one tweet away from witnessing a mystery taking place. In 1983 that was a different story.All in all I give it 8/10. Like I said, it locked me down for an entire day. The story is a good pace that keeps you interested. Some things probably could have been explained better, but who knows; as thorough as they were, some of the missing details was probably intentional. This is a good one for everyone. But if you're 30 and older and love a good nostalgia-esk experience, WATCH THIS SHOW!!",8
"The Stranger Things is now one of the best shows out there, and has some fantastic special FX and story, and if you are from the 80s or earlier you will even like this show more.For me Stranger Things is a mixture between E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982), The Goonies (1985), and Poltergeist (1982), also movies i love.If you want a TV Show that gives you back the 80s feeling when you were young then this TV show is for you, it's funny it's trilling it has action and it's creepy, you will never get bored with this first season, After each episode, you long for more episodes.It's just like seeing E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982), The Goonies (1985), and Poltergeist (1982) for the first time.See it you will love it.",10
"While I think this show is pretty good, it had things going on that left a bad taste in my mouth after the hype and excitement of seeing it had waned.1.- What were those experiments they were trying before 11 was born? What was their purpose? 2.- What were they trying to accomplish with eleven? They clearly stumbled upon the ""upside down world"" and the thing inside it, but what were they hoping to accomplish then? 3.- Why was the thing unaware of how to enter this world until eleven made her presence felt? The monster started opening portals left and right once it knew where the other world was. 4.- Why wasn't there any evidence of the monster opening a hole in the house's wall when it scared the mom?",8
"Hopefully Stranger Things will add a second season, as the first was one of the best series I have ever enjoyed. Throw out any preconceived notions about whether it's ""hokey"" and try watching just two episodes. You have a better than 90% chance of enjoying it. I rolled my eyes at first, thinking: how could an 8-episode series of an '80s throwback be something worth watching? The previews showed influences of Close Encounters, E.T., Goonies and even Silent Hill, and I wasn't interested in embracing the nostalgic aspect. The opening credits really dug right into the 1980's, and even the title slid in as if it suggested that Stephen King's own name would burn into my LCD screen. I'll just get right into the meat and potatoes. All the players work, all the scenery, action, editing, and photography really create a great series. I can't think of any one episode that they could have thrown out, because they all really go well together. As for the kids, the one fear I have is that these child actors are getting older. They can't keep riding their bikes and talking with lisps. So I can't imagine that Stranger Things will have a long run, unless they wind up doing away with them, or changing up the story altogether. And that would be a shame because the talent of all those kids is DEEP. Take for example, Millie Bobby Brown (who plays El). So few words come out of her mouth, yet her expressions and emotions carry so well. The kids are like Our Gang - you just fantasize of becoming a kid again, grabbing your bike with its reflectors and streamers, and hanging out with them after school. One typically might expect that kids running about on their own to make things right in their neighborhood is rather hackneyed, but the writing and execution of the plot for each episode kept driving action, adventure, mystery and drama, without it ever feeling as if it were getting stale or bogged down. Even when the story had to explain things, the characters got right to the point and took action. Only a couple of the adults played central characters and they certainly did well also. Chief Jim Hopper and Joyce Byers are introduced as people with some shredded back stories, and the Duffer Brothers - the writers / directors - slowly peel back the layers of their pasts. I put Stranger Things beyond The Walking Dead and Peaky Blinders, into Breaking Bad territory - not to compare whether it's ""better"" than any of my favorites, because it's so different than any other series.",10
While I realise that different strokes are for different folks for the life of me I am gob smacked how this has such high ratings. One could argue that this is simply a SciFi film but come on dudes this is at best a remake of ET except ET was actually quite a decent film.It is the biggest pile of rubbish I have ever watched. Slow in the beginning - even slower in the end. Acting is terrible and dialogue is pathetic. Seen a review that says only watch if you are U22 years of age. I sayDO NOT BOTHER TRYING TO GET INTO THIS. Utter tripe !! vs Wasting appoximatly 8 hours of your life,1
"Stranger Things is the latest Netflix Original to take the world by storm and from what I heard of the show before I watched it I could guess why. From reviews it sounded like it was damn near perfect, an original concept with great writing, a well known actress leading the helm with some talented new faces thrown into the mix, and overall great direction and visuals. It sounded too good to be true and unfortunately it was, I strapped into the first two episodes ready to have my mind blown and came out the other end with my mind very much intact as I scratched it and wondered where I had saw this show before.To my dismay Stranger Things is not an original concept by any means, in fact it is the exact opposite of an original concept. Every single thing in show has been borrowed from every piece of media based in the 80's or classic sci-fi. At first it would seem as though Stranger Things merely pays homage to these classics and that would all be fine if that was the case but it's made painfully obvious the this show blatantly steals things from other pieces of media. The Twilight Zone, The X-Files, Goonies, E.T, Alien, a literal exact shot from Stand By Me, the list goes on. The reason no one notices this is the show blinds it's viewers with 80'S nostalgia forcing constant references and throwbacks so viewers will be saying ""hey Risky Business! I remember that movie!"" instead of ""Didn't they do something like this in an episode of Outer Limits?""This forcing of 80's pop culture also distracts the watcher from just how bad the writing is. The story holds up simply because it takes the best elements from other stories instead of actually coming up with their own spin on things but the rest of the writing seems sloppy. Dialogue can be hit or miss, sometimes it's perfectly fine, other times it's either really unnatural or just plain boring. Characters are in a similar situation, some are interesting, realistic and a joy to watch, others are bland, or in the case of Mike and Nancy's family, only exist when it's convenient. Not to mention the constant inconsistencies like how Eleven has no idea about the concept of friends or time yet she doesn't question teachers, bullies or anything else that happens in school or even the concept of school itself. She knows not to kill or hurt the school bully yet when she killed or hurt in the facility she was given affection.The direction is OK, it's not exactly bad but nothing really stands out about it either it captures the feel of the 80's well enough and establishes the tone but other than that visually the show is quite boring with a few exceptions. The music fits the tone perfectly and builds tension but just like everything else in the show it's pretty much a rehash of every sci-fi theme ever, like X-files or Twilight Zone.The show does have one stand out though and that's the acting. Every single actor gives it their all and I mean their all. Winona Ryder plays her part of the anxious mother who everyone thinks is crazy but really knows what's actually going on perfectly. David Harbour is so interesting as Police Chief Hopper and is easily my favourite character to watch, he is the character with the most depth and Harbour's acting talent really does show how troubled and determined Hopper is. The child actors also deserve a shout out because not only are they not terrible they're actually some of the best actors in the show. Even the poorly written characters like Nancy are acted well and make the dialogue and writing much more bearable, making it so I could actually get past the first two episodes and continue with the series.In the end, Stranger Things is just OK, it has quite a few redeeming qualities but it also has a lot of flaws. Really the worst thing about it is just how insulting it is to it's audience and how little effort has gone into something that is getting so much praise. Watch it if you like classic sci-fi and want to see an updated take on some of your favourite tropes but make sure to turn off your brain and not take it too seriously, just have fun with it.. But if you really want a homage to classic sci-fi done masterfully then I would suggest you look elsewhere, probably to Super 8.The real strange thing is how what should be just a fun, cheesy cult sci-fi show has somehow tricked everyone into thinking it's the next Breaking Bad.",5
"Please follow in the footsteps of The Wire and keep this series to a few seasons instead of falling in the trap of so many other series. Please wrap this thing up after a few seasons instead of staging it out simply to make more money. Too many serious are only concerned with making money as opposed to wrapping up a good story. You have the making for an incredible sorry but please, please don't drag this out and follow the follow the footsteps of Prison Break and Lost.I love this series and would be remiss if you thought you had to keep producing more and more simply to make more money. Holy crap IMDb, how much more do you need from me before you will allow this to be published. This clearly wasn't enough so screw you and your ten line minimum. Who can't write a concise review in under ten lines? Apparently I can't, which is why you aren't allowing this review to go through. If you think that a few lines isn't enough to give a concise review of this series, then you clearly need to talk to your programmers. Still not enough? Holy crap this site sucks majorly, maybe you should reconsider how long a review needs to be before arbitrarily blocking anyone that spends a few minutes writing a review.",10
"Alright, I gave this a 7, but I truly loved the show and hope that there will be more to come. Let's start with the negative: - One of the things I disliked from this show - and from a great many other shows - is, what seems to me, the use of useless scenes, or ''fillers''. The teenage ''romance'' between Nancy and Steve is entirely unnecessary, and just slows down the pace of the show for no reason - except for wasting airtime. As such, it falls short of other tightly-written or directed TV series such as London Spy, The Night Manager, Humans, and The Man in the High Castle - to name a few. Every scene and word in these shows are clues and propel the program forward. There is not a single word wasted. - Another thing that annoyed me was the cartoon-ish acting of some of the characters: the two policemen, the librarian, and other minor characters. While this may be funny in comic books, in my experience, real-life people don't act or talk that way. - And my last negative point, which some here have pointed out, is the constant annoying whining from Joyce (Winona Ryder). It almost makes us not feel sorry for her plight. Now, on to more positive things!: - The acting of 11 is almost beyond belief. It was almost like a fully grown adult had inhabited a child's body. When I went (had to) go dig up some info on her and found out that her parents were Brits, I wasn't surprised. Great acting and presence is somehow in their DNA! - While I loved the music, I found that both the electronic and the pop stuff were out of place for this show. The electronic score would have better suited Tron or something slicker. I also doubt that Echo & the Bunnymen were the hit of the year in small town America. Then again, Jonathan was an ''different'' - so who knows. I'm really looking forward to how they will continue this. Or maybe, they can do like the Brits, and just end it on a high note, and make something entirely different.",7
"This is my first review and I'd like to write since many people didn't make the obvious connection: Stranger Things ""borrows"" so many things from Resident Evil 0 and Silent Hill movie that it's borderline theft.The ""bad man"" is James Marcus from Resident Evil 0. He is a white haired, tailored suit man that every government has.Parallel dimension is nothing new but the way they treat it is directly borrowed from Silent Hill 4.The creature? It is the most obvious one: It is the Leech from Resident Evil 0. The Leech! Please make a Google Image Search and tell me they are different. I immediately got cold feet after seeing it because it's borderline theft.Best thing about Stranger Things is Winona Ryder. And her part has been ""borrowed"" too, from Silent Hill movie. Child got lost in a different dimension, she goes a bit out of her mental health but she has been always right and at the end she ""rescues"" her child. It is so... Let me put it this way: If Winona Ryder didn't act extraordinarily great, this show would be irredeemable.I'd also like to point out that Stranger Things had no impact on me. Not on horror-wise or plot- wise... I watched it and said ""meh"". As a ""meh"", it gets a 4/10 from me.",4
"The first thing i need to say is ,as a kid i watched a lot of VHS recorded movies and the sense of adventure was always big when i watched The Goonies , Indiana Jones ,etc....I like the old school vibe of this show and i really like to remember the old days when kids used their imagination to play in the street , not their mind-numbness as we see today :\I loved the 1st season and the transition for the 2nd was really well accomplished so lets hope it will be as great as this one.Please watch this show and give it a 10* , this must stay at the top as one of the greatest Netflix productions .",10
"OK, usually I don't bother with reviews from the first seasons. I am that ""holding back"" guy who doesn't like to rush into believe in something. But THIS, guys, was EXTRAURDINARY! The period, perfect! The casting, good. The kids were diamonds! No more than 15 y.o. and already better than most B rating actors. But the most amazing, was the story. Aaaa smells fresh, just out of the oven! Sure the concept is known, sure some characters we have seen them before. But it's not about that. The way they put them together along with the new elements... This writer should be proud of this work! And I am lucky I got to see it. Be prepared to stay on the edge of your couch, sink into thinking, get sad and happy. Be ready to enjoy a truly good series.",10
"Don't misunderstand me. This TV series is by no means bad. But it is definitely not worth more than 6 stars. By all means, it has its merits. There is good acting, good special effects, and the children are not at all annoying. But what really ground my gears was the uneven pacing. There are entire episodes when nothing noteworthy happens and the plot does not progress at all. I mean this TV series has only eight episodes to begin with but it still was a huge effort to watch it all because of all the tedious bits. Additionally, the plot is extremely predictable. There were a few twists and revelations on the way but they were never surprising and you could actually see them from a mile away. At first I was intrigued by all the mystery around eleven at the beginning of the show, but her background and her connection to the other dimension became clear rather quickly. Some people might like it because of all the throw- backs to the 80s, but not being a child from this era, I did not feel nostalgic about that, but others might enjoy the show due to exactly these references. Furthermore, the story had the potential to be really scary but apart from the odd jump-scare you will not get frightened at all. So, in my opinion, it was really quite boring and I will not watch the second season.",6
"I hope this is renewed.Lots of great writing and premises. But a little over acted and dramatic. Too much yelling. The adults could act little more like mature adults.Love the strong women characters. But am troubled by what happens to a stereotypical fat girl. Why do blacks always die and get crucified all the time? Why are fat people vilified? Very X-Files, Spielberg and Stephen King in flavor. Needs a few more creative twists instead of leaning on what has been done before. Duffer Bros. make your mark in a new way.",8
"This was an enormously enjoyable production and has something for everyone. The acting was superb, especially from the children. My only complaint is the size of the plot holes. Having introduced an interesting idea from mainstream science the writers seemed to forget the need for consistency with the idea in the narrative. Most of these loose ends and inconsistencies showed up in the final chapter. For pedants such as myself, the resulting plot holes took something of the shine off this otherwise excellent series. Finally, it is pleasing that we have a series here that has an actual end in sight, although the producers seemed to have left a chink open for a second series.",8
"I'm sure by now everyone knows about this show, so instead of writing the same stuff you've probably read already, I just want to focus on three things: 1. Yes, they did manage to give it an awesome '80s vibe, from the opening sequence to the end credits. Having grown up with these movies myself, I can attest to that. However, I think it will appeal to younger audiences as well. After all, there must be reasons that movies such as ""The Goonies"" and ""E.T."" remain memorable even now, other than the ""'80s vibe"". 2. The creators of the show (the Duffer brothers) have somewhat regretted having Winona Ryder's character acting so hysterically from the start. I disagree with that. That's EXACTLY how a real person would act if *spoiler* happened to her. I hate it when in most movies e.g. the hero loses someone very close to them, then they cry for a brief moment and then it's back to the action. That's ridiculous. 3. I liked how they gradually revealed pieces of the puzzle in every episode. No matter how clever your plot twist/secret is, if the building up period exceeds a certain point, then you'll have created too high expectations and it will be impossible to impress your viewers after that. I'm afraid that this will be a one off deal. I'm sure that the incredible success of the first season will lead to a second one, but given the plot and the ending, I doubt they'll be able to keep it to as high a level. In my honest opinion, the best case scenario would be if they wrote a similar story with a similar setting and maybe even have the same actors play different roles. I really, really wish they'll prove me wrong, but I'm afraid that a direct sequel is doomed to fail. Especially since this was supposed to be a one season show and they only discuss about making a second one because of all its unexpected success.",9
"There's just one thing that really impressed me about this series and that is the high IMDb rating given to this heap of garbage.I say this because I find it utterly amazing that the reviewers who rated this steaming pile of excrement with 9's and 10's must surely ALL be under 12 years of age, and yet they have somehow managed to write reviews that, for the most part, are well worded, grammatically correct and with very few spelling errors. So - well done, kids!!For anyone over 12 years of age - please, just stay right away from this stinker.(PS: Would it have hurt to have given poor ""11"" a Kleenex tissue or two?)",1
"What made me curious about stranger things is not about the hype. I've only read this once or twice somewhere from browsing the internet but the appeal it has on my geek senses really told me to watch this. Truly a hidden masterpiece over hundreds of TV series nowadays. It has this nostalgic feeling when you're a 90's or 80's kid and if you're also a fan of reading books, you could just almost imagine how the book will be like. The kid inside everyone may be related to any character in the series and the cinematography is just amazing. When you are alone at night, where everything is quiet and you feel like you wanna go for a time travel or immerse in a new world... Stranger Things delivers that feeling. Good job Duffer Brothers! Please don't screw up those upcoming seasons.",10
"i don't get it what do people see in this show? actors overacted, everybody wants to be the main character while the villain who should have been at the center of the story was at the edge of it. and whats the deal with the intro and the 80's thing? if you are really into old and stuff go watch the 80's movie but not star wars, or better live in a village or somewhere, people are really tasteless in music! you think it was original? let me correct you right there, there was nothing original. you don't believe me right? go watch ""Akira"" it is an Japanese animated movie released in 1988 you'll see how much original El is watch ""insidious"", ""E.T"" it's like the evil version of it and there are may more. netflix wasted 8 hours of my life. go watch these movies and watch the series again then you'll see how much original the series is!! after doing this do message me if you think i'm wrong",5
"Disappointing. Weak plot and no emphasis on details.Although the main poster gives a precise hint on the spirit of the series, I did not expect that it would be just a mixture of references to classical horror or Sci-Fi movies and the series would not have its unique features.Four kids and their journey, strongly resembled the movie ""Stand by Me"", but unlike their counterparts from 1986 classic, kids in this series did not create meaningful characters, huge nod to their acting talents though. The plot was too stereotypical and one could easily guess what would happen next. For example, finding Will Byers with animal's tentacle in his mouth rang ""Alien"" bells too loudly, while showing Yoda toy to Eleven automatically meant that she could do the same as the Jedi master. By the way, why was she called ""Eleven"" when apparently she was the first of her kind?! Just to be able to shorten her name till ""Ives""? Not funny.In addition, there were inconsistencies in the plot and details were treated careless. For example, Eleven did not even know the meaning of the word ""friend"" but she knew what kissing in the lips meant and how automatic sliding doors work. Also Will's mother was not happy at first that his son wanted to see ""Poltergeist"", but ""The Thing"" poster revealed that the kids have already watched scarier movies in the past. Besides, lighting up Christmas tree light bulbs one by one? ""That is not how the Force works!"" And the last but not least — who will cut his/her hand before fighting a monster?! No rational person, nobody!Talking about the monster, the Demogorgon, SFXs were cheap like the way used to kill the monster. ""Deus ex Machina"" moment and the sacrifice of the main character is not the final of the season deserves. Although it was a good reference to the final of ""The Matrix Revolutions"", anyway it was reference to the bad ending taking into account that Hopper and waffle scene hinted Eleven is still alive.In short, screenplay for the first season was too weak but there is still hope.",5
"Love this show. The acting, character development, setting, characters, tone, and writing are fantastic. The dynamics between the characters are sweet and interesting. I'm glad to finally have an intense and clean show to watch. The music and sound add to the mystique and horror. I really hope they do more seasons. My husband even loved it and misses watching it, which says a lot because not many shows hold his interest. He can usually figure out shows too soon or find all of the holes in the plot, but he was very impressed with this series. Again, I really hope they continue this series on Netflix and maybe make some more quality shows like this one. Love the 80's nostalgia.",10
"What an amazing new series! I was getting tired of hearing about all these supposedly amazing TV shows, such as Game of Thrones, The Walking Dead and Breaking Bad that people always talk about, so when I heard there was a new entry to that list I said screw it, and jumped in, and boy was it great.At the beginning the show follows 5 different perspectives of the story, Mike and the gang, Joyce, Hopper, Nancy, and Jonathan. Even though there were a lot of characters I didn't struggle to remember any names, as I usually do. This isn't because they said their names a lot, but more because all of the characters felt like real people, they were believable.Later on the 5 perspectives change into 3, Mike and the gang, Nancy and Jonathan, and Hopper and Joyce. Each team are uncovering one piece of the puzzle, making it extremely satisfying when everyone teams up in the end, so that every character knows everything.Every writer nailed it, and every actor/actress did an extremely good job, so it is difficult to find flaws here, and I tried to ignore them, but the same one kept showing up.The biggest ""problem"" is that the CGI (special effects) -team was either too small for the job or didn't have a big enough budget to keep the quality consistent. I'll try keeping this spoiler free, but there is one scene with a knife and a big jump, where the special effects are just not believable and it really pulls you out of the experience. Hopefully you know what scene I'm talking about if you've seen the show.Now that I come to think of it this next part reminds me a lot of the situation the director of Jaws had when they were filming, which was that the shark didn't look very good, so they had to keep it off- screen for most of the film to not ruin it. It is very much the same with Stranger Things, because in fight scenes with the monster in the last episode the lights keep blinking a lot, not only did this save the CGI team a lot of work, but it also saved the viewers the feeling of this not being real. But there is nothing wrong with that, because they solved the problem, well the thing is that they sort of took it back, since in one of the last scenes with Eleven the monster simply doesn't look realistic enough.I would still be willing to give it a 10/10 if that was it, because everything else is just so well done, but the final small detail that made me go to a 9 was that the last episode had me thinking the episode was ending like 5 times. The final 4-6 scenes were directed in such a way that it always looked like the credits were about to come up, making me actually want the episode to end instead of the opposite.All in all, watch this show. I can actually guarantee you that you'll like it, if it was possible to give a 9.7 I would do that.Watch it.",8
"This show could have been terrific except it does exactly what we all laugh about bad horror movies. It has characters that do the stupidest things just so the story can continue. Two examples: The Sheriff decides to break into the CIA/NSA Dep't of Energy facility alone, with no idea where he's going or who he may come up against. AND, of course he finds nothing of value but does allow the CIA to bug his trailer. Then Karen Wheeler, in the woods at night with Jonathan, decides to climb through a wall of goo ALONE, to go inside a mysterious tree. She doesn't first call Jonathan to show him what she found,and maybe go in together or tell someone, like the Sheriff. No, instead she climbs through this goo into a tree trunk ALL BY HERSELF. And she's supposed to be one of the smartest students at school. Give me a break!!! It's garbage like this that ruins a show.",3
"Yes it is full of 80's nostalgia, but that is not necessarily a bad thing at all. The cinematography is just amazing, the kids' performances are fantastic, the story is... well, the story is just OK. Considering that i'm writing this review with only first season aired, i believe some of the major flaws will be properly fixed for the next seasons. The show has a great potential, but DO NOT expect an ""10"" show, nor ever an ""9.1"". My eight is far generous, could be an 7.5 with honors. I recommend watching the first couple episodes, and if you're not hooked, don't waste any more time. It's a show for people who like an specific kind of sci-fi and are not too exigent.",8
"I watched one review of this series which said something to the effect that they were trying to get the ""feel"" of a 1980s Spielberg/King/Carpenter movie. IF that's what they were trying to do, they succeeded. However, I can't help but feel I've lost 8 hours of my life that I'll never get back. Poorly written. Found myself being bored more often than not. Matthew Modine... What for? Winona Ryder... What for? Their lackluster performances could've been brought to life by unknowns so much better. There are things that happen in this series that normal, rational people just wouldn't do which just kills it for me. Case in point. Nancy is out in the woods with Jonathan and decides to go into the tree through to the other dimension without waiting for Jonathan... WRONG! The acting is poor throughout the series and the overacting by Ms. Ryder. If a book dragged on this long? They've taken 8 episodes to drag out what should've been covered in 4. Enough said.",5
"If i could give 20 stars I would. So many characters deserve awards especially Eleven - Millie Bobby Brown. Every time I thought I knew what was going to happen, the story would take a different turn. It falls into the awesome category between Horror and Drama. I heard reviews before I watched but nothing could prepare me for what I just witness. We watched the entire season in less then 24 hours. It reminded me of a great book that you just can't put down. If you are second guessing yourself about watching it. DON'T you will not be disappointed. I have to admit we are about bunch of horror junkies and that's how we began to watch. But I can't even put it in that category alone. Its been a long time since a series has actually caught me and pulled me in. I felt like I was there with every character, every step of the way. We can't wait for season 2. The ending definitely surprised us all. KEEP UP the great work.",10
"I'm an AMC- Walking Dead fan. Which I feel is one of the most innovated ""zombie"" / apocalyptic concepts ever!However, after a binge viewing of ""Stranger Things"", I would now watch stranger things over the Walking Dead.I love the 80's setting, attire, and couple of those ""Star Wars"" references. Its also reminiscences of the old Steven King series"" Amazing Stories"".This series is captivating. But you must know if you it has great cliff hangers and once you start you'll stay up all night with watching the ""next"" episode.",10
"This TV series is just brilliant. It contains bits from the insanity watched in Fringe, drama from Twin Peaks, the thriller from X-files and craziness from Goonies. The wardrobe, gadgets and environment are very consistent with the time-frame. Particularly, when regarding to the old walky talky, He-Man and Skeletor on the TV, a poster of Jaws (the first movie.Young actors are good and sometimes even better than adults. Some scenes might be considered a bit violent and classified as horror but it is pretty much soft. these rare scenes come and go fast as glimpses. Since I first watched the first episode became a fan. don't know about the season 2 but I'm waiting. Hope you watch and like it as I",9
"*** This review may contain spoilers ***I watched the first season, chapter after chapter, waiting for it to get better.I kept feeling like I was watching an old movie, you know, like when you watch an old movie and giggle at the effects and styles used.Saw the lovely reviews it got and kept expecting something exciting to happen.It's very predictable and a bit boring. I ended up playing on my phone waiting for something to happen.If you're looking for some thrills and excitement, look for something else.",3
"Really a 6/10 but I had to give a 1/10 but its getting overrated.The show follow the 80s so by the book, it's hard to get any message from it.Is it it good? well almost.... almost...Winona Ryder and David Harbour manage to carry the show through weaker parts. The kids are cringeworthy but believable.The show sometimes follows old plots and 80's theme so hard, it just loses focus. It's become almost a parody in some parts.The production values are good. It surprisingly didn't feel cheesy.Still it lost itself following/imitating better movies.Only watch if you YOU want too. Your not missing anything by not watching it, Its IS overrated.",1
"I don't understand the hype behind this show nor the praise. I don't understand what critics find so special about it. I believe this is one of the most overrated series on IMDb and it is a shame it got renewed for a second season. It has all the clichés of horror movies, whether in the poorly developed characters' behaviour or in some scenes that felt like a horror parody. The show lacks originality and feels like a weird mix between Silent Hill, The Goonies, and E.T.Stranger things is the kind of series that keeps you watching with cliffhangers while nothing really happens. The first season ended with a good episode just to give you the impression that you have not wasted your time and in the end you had a good time.The only bright side about this show was the amazing performances by David Harbour and Gaten Matarazzo. Appreciating this show and enjoying it simply amounts to intellectual masturbation and nostalgia for the 1980s.",5
"The show centres around a group of nerdy misfit twelve year-old boys. The brothers who created, wrote and directed this were twelve in 1996 and that's very telling, the nostalgia isn't for the 1980s but for mainstream family films of the 1980s as seen from a distance and not as lived.There is nothing real or authentic or original to be found here, it's a film-kit made up of references, plot lines and characters cobbled together from various Spielberg films as written and filmed by inexperienced film-makers - everything is obvious, on-the-nose, and lacking in depth.",
"I started watching this show expecting not to like it, simply because everyone around me had been hyping it so much, I felt I could only be disappointed. It didn't only NOT disappoint, but I got exactly why all those people, 80s kids like me, loved this show so much.We grew up watching E.T., Firestarter, Stand by me and Poltergeist, the last one, hiding behind the sofa for most of the film because our parents had realised it was too scary for elementary children and sent us to bed an hour ago.We all had walkie talkies that never quite worked as we expected them to, we all jumped at noises in the dark wondering what kind of monster (or benevolent alien) was lurking there and we all associated those heavy synthesizers with the ""something big's about to happen"" moment.And we are all very, very nostalgic geeks. The Duffer brothers didn't have a hard time making us happy, because they knew exactly what we wanted, and they delivered.",10
"Upon hearing about the new show Stranger Things, I was at first a little skeptic. So many shows and movies have done the topic, and it was kinda just another one that would come and go with no real fan base as far as I thought. Watching episode one I was clearly mistaken. the episode was well done, the characters I immediately fell in love with, and the episode ended with a cliffhanger. I thought Walking Dead was gripping. As you join on the quest to find Will Byers, you will feel nostalgia, and a longing for that time in the 80s that a lot of viewers actually haven't lived (myself included. A fan of the 80s all the way, but born in the 90s). References to pop culture aren't overdone, the music is just amazing and makes you feel like you're in the decade, and the small details are even fine tuned to make you think for the duration of the episode you were in the 80s while watching it. The story is so good that immediately after the first season, I and my friends began to talk about what could be happening next, the wait for season two will be long and arduous, but totally worth it for this gripping show.",10
"This show is amazing.Just finished watching it about an hour ago. This is amazing. seriously. It's a thriller and a horror show, but also funny, brings happiness, and DEM FEELS!!! Seriously, if you have doubt, give this a try! I thought it's pretty overrated because everyone was talking about this. And I gave it a try, and its amazing! I love the tone, the writing is SPECTACULAR!This show is an amazing early 80s throwback, the screenplay and actors do an amazing job of conveying a sense of the time with references and feel in the show. and the performance!I usually don't expect much from kid actors but all of the child actors here were amazing. Seriously, go watch it",9
"So I am going to sound extremely knowledgeable here so that my review seems interesting AND I reach the minimum amount of words needed to post my review :POK, that's the best I could do. meh!Well, not that big a fan of show's seeming to outdated, started off with minimum expectations, and bammmmm, there I was, totally sucked into it.The way they have given screen time to every character and allowed them to grow on their own, its amazing. You can't pick up a clear ""lead"" like in other shows, which is good.There are enough laughs and tears along the way, you get attached with the characters, I loved the kids, specially Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) and Eleven (Millie Brown) and Mike (Finn wolfhard) AND the rest of them for that matter.The story line is also very good, they don't waste your time like other show's who assume that they are going to go on forever and increase the episodes uselessly and irritatingly. And best part is that it doesn't leave you unsatisfied in the end, they give you a sort of closure, to please you and YET keep enough unanswered questions, so that you want more but can happily wait.This is how a TV Show should be made, sensible closure's for every seasons, and at the max 8/10 episodes per season.WATCH IT!",9
"Stranger Things is an eight-episode Netflix original series created by the Duffer Brothers. Upon its release, it gained phrase from audiences and critics alike. After having been recommended this series by multiple people, I began to watch it fairly recently. I cannot say it hooked me - otherwise I would have finished it days earlier - but it was entertaining enough to watch all the way through. A lot worked in terms of characters and their development, but there were two particular things that didn't work; which I will talk about later in this review.In terms of positives, there is enough to phrase here. The characters and strong and effectively carry the show - the group of kids, who are the most central characters, are all particularly entertaining and witty - even if some of their performances aren't great. Winona Ryder's acting is by far the best, and David Harbour also gives a good performance (and a great character) as the police chief. The teenage characters aren't quite as strong, and the typical love triangle sub-plot bores, but none of them are bad. The character development throughout the series is great, making all the characters more and more likable as the series goes on. On the whole, the casting is excellent - everyone fits their part very well.Thankfully, it is consistent in its quality. None of the episodes are bad; although none of them are fantastic either. For me, each episode scores a 7 or an 8. The consistency keeps it from getting boring, which made it a series which I wanted to watch to the end. The other positives include a great soundtrack which works very well with the show's themes and scenes; a fun, if very retro title sequence; and generally good dialogue throughout.However, as mentioned above, there are two places in which this series falls down. The first of which is the lack of originality and clichés. This series is ultimately a homage of 80's sci-fi - there are scenes that reference, and steal from movies such as E.T., Aliens, The Thing, The Goonies and many more. At first the nostalgic references may work - but as the show goes on you release that it is not just referencing these movies, but blatantly stealing from them. Not one thing in this entire series is particularly original - everything becomes ridiculously clichéd and thus predictable. Unless this is the first movie or TV show you have ever seen, you will probably find the predictability and clichéness of this series very annoying (as I did).The other main issue is that almost all the twists are revealed far too early. There are too few surprises. We learn most things before the characters do and then have to watch as they finally catch up with the audience, which sometimes takes multiple episodes. So when a big shock comes around for the characters, there is absolutely no shock for the audience; which ultimately makes a lot of the series much less effective.But despite this, there are enough human dramas, engaging characters and sci-fi elements to make this an enjoyable eight episodes. In the end I would recommend this to a friend, even though this series falls short of the heights of the films it aspires to be.",7
"This show brings the audience to the 80's realm and as a 90's kid, this totally blew me off. The old school American ambiance is so ethereally relaxing. It's like watching The Bridges of Madison County minus the adult romance. The radio, the country slash town life, the costume, everything was perfect. If you're into this kind of classic stuff, I'm sure you'll be definitely loving this series!The characters'acting and emotions deserve everyone's respect and praise. I couldn't find any character more fitting to their designated roles (except Nancy and Jonathan perhaps *forgive my bias but they could hell do a lot better on the next season*). Millie Bobby Brown (El), Winona Ryder (Joyce) and Gaten Matarazzo (Dustin) are my favorites. El's iconic stare, smile and speech really caught my heart and got me utterly flabbergasted. Joyce's weary and frantic beautiful eyes did its job damn so well. This show really showcased each and everyone's experience and potential in acting. Almost all characters got the ""charm"" the audience unconsciously desire so bad. One best example is Dustin's character, who's supposedly the real science nerd and mediator of the group. This boy's got the bomb for real. What I'm looking for the next season is perhaps they could highlight Lucas' and Mike's character to redeem themselves from their role (though I can honestly say they did their job pretty well).Story-wise, the pacing was medium-fast. Few to almost zero loopholes. This show for me doesn't belong to horror genre but more on the family/mystery/adventure corner which I think could be watchable to kids 10 and up. The eerie art, grimly colorful lights, and the classic 80's music complemented each sequence harmoniously. All I could ever say is that this show has got it all! The thrill, hype, romance, camaraderie vibe, subtle contempt, everything is here folks! Just watch and you'll never regret a minute of your life! I can't wait for the next season!!!",10
"I finished Stranger Things and although I thought it was alright, I can't say there's any chance I would've finished if everybody else wasn't raving about it. I have issues with it that I will now explain. SPOILERSI found the acting to be unimpressive. The children were great for TV child actors, but whenever their scenes came up I was unconvinced and disengaged. I also found most of the characters to be annoying to watch. They continually made assumptions that were silly with the information they had at the time. There are times where characters come to a far-fetched conclusion that is coincidentally correct, but if it weren't the truth these conclusions would make the characters seem dumb and crazy based on the information. Another thing about the characters is the sudden emotional shifts they would make towards one another that seemed so artificial and often out of character. It would be difficult to explain without going through an episode beat by beat, but it's all about the time, reason, and development.Throughout the series, with the exclusion of the sheriff, characters are constantly fumbling through the dangerous situations without any prior knowledge and preparation for them. Yet all of the main characters, except for Eleven who was obviously going to die from the very beginning, never die or take any serious injuries. When characters fumble around and just keep escaping with no effort or plan, slowly all the tension is lost for me. The reason I say with exception to Hopper, is because in his scenes he is the only character who seems at all capable and plans like his situations are actually dangerous.Let's talk about the homage aspect, because that's what it is, not a parody or satire. The clichés and awful, stupid parts of the series were often used knowing that they were clichés, but the series never did anything to show any SELF-AWARENESS. These clichés were placed with the knowledge that they are 80s tropes, but the series didn't show it understood what makes these tropes stupid! It just used them, never satirizing, exaggerating, or critiquing. When the villain of the series is overly evil and underdeveloped, when the dog somehow has the ability to sense the supernatural, it's not making fun of it. If someone can give me some reason as to how the series did show self-awareness, that would be appreciated.Let's address the monster in the room, that monster. It's rules are poorly defined, and the one characteristic they do give it doesn't make sense. It clearly only needs a small amount of blood going by how much Barbara bled before she was taken. So in the weeks in between when the monster first appears to get Will Byer and the end where El turns it into pixie dust, only six people in the entire area had any bleeding?! It's also interesting how Steve had blood on his face after his fight, but the monster never showed up then. I guess we never heard about that one HOSPITAL that got raided by the monster. And I guess all the women in the town never had any periods.The CG is bad. Don't tell me that it is an intentional, artistic decision, you know what the 80s were good for? Does it know what all those movies it kept referencing are known for, practical effects! I burst out laughing when the monster got burned by the CG fire.The ending isn't well-contained or wrapped up with so many loose ends left dangling for the sake of a happy ending from which to jump into a second season. However, the show does show self-awareness about this, when the kids are playing DND at the end they complain about how the campaign ended suddenly on a happy note with loose ends left unfinished. Take that for what you will.As someone who isn't that into 80s electronic music, I thought the soundtrack ranged from really good to OK depending on the song and how it was used. It was well shot and lit for a TV show, but I can't say I was ever impressed just having come out of Midnight Special that is similar in concept, tone, and aesthetic with far more impressive film making.If I wanted to go through the series episode by episode, I could keep going on and on. Just my thoughts on the series, with everyone raving about how fantastic it is I felt like I needed to defend my feelings on it. I'm glad everybody else loves it, but I would be lying if I said I would give it higher than a 6/10.",6
"I'm not gonna say much about this. Stranger Things has a 9.1 on IMDb, so that means it's one of the best shows ever, but I don't see why the ratings are so high. Episode 1 was good (7/10), episode 2 was good (7/10), and episode three was good as well (7/10), but I have no idea how they get 8.7, 8.6, and 9.1/10 ratings on here. For other TV shows, for an episode to get more than a 9/10 it has to be something spectacular. Here, it seems like anything remotely good can get an 8.5 or a 9/10 just because it is in Stranger Things. I think the ratings for this are only so high because people are so nostalgic about the 80's and are more influenced by their nostalgia than by actual quality of the episodes.Overall, Stranger Things is a good show and very well produced, but it's not the masterpiece that people say it is.",1
"I'm not gonna write a long review because I don't want to repeat what many others have said. Stranger Things is a good show- it's very well directed and acted, it has a pretty interesting mystery, and some of the first episodes are pretty creepy- but it is nowhere near the level of quality many people say it is. I liked the amount of suspense and horror in the first few episodes, but as the show went on it became more about the uninspired characters and less about the mystery, sci fi and horror, and when we finally saw the Demagorgen it looked really cheap. I've watched all of the episodes, and the only episodes that impressed me were the second one, which had a great first half but dropped the ball a bit in the last 30 minutes, and Holly Jolly. I think (like some people have already said), the super-high rating this show has on IMDb might just be because so many people are nostalgic about the 80's and not because Stranger Things is actually one of the best shows ever. Stranger Things isn't a bad show, but it's nowhere near as good as people say it is.",7
"Stranger Things is starting to look like the best and most gripping series since Breaking Bad. The story itself is farcical in places but this suits the style of the piece, which is both based on and stooped in fantasy and science fiction. If you are expecting pure realism or even a completely sensible plot, look elsewhere, otherwise prepare for a journey to the twisted and dark sides of the imaginations of child and adult alike.The best thing about the story is that it is so multifaceted - it is a kid's story, a fairy tale; a coming of age story; a story about adulthood, of loss, grief and responsibility. What brings this all together is the fantastic performances of the cast all round. All the child actors are brilliant and bring something unique to the table, but particular note has to be given to Finn Wolfhard and Millie Brown who's relationship and exceptional performances form the backbone of the series. Charlie Heaton is standout as a young man who's had to fill the shoes of an absent father, and really is the hidden gem of this show. Both Winona Ryder and David Harbour are excellent too, with both giving stunning and at times heart-wrenching performances throughout. Though, that being said, most of the credit must go to the kids who absolutely carry the show.The cinematography is simple, humble but beautiful. The design and appearance of the various settings are spot on, particularly the 'upside-down', which is the stuff of nightmares. The music is perfect, unique and really ties everything together whilst being the key to the suspense this show does so well. You can tell there are some clever minds behind the scenes, but as is often the case with such skillful acting overall, the show seems completely natural and there is little conscious sense that it's been so carefully written, plotted and directed.I absolutely cannot fault this show and consider it a must watch. Yes, you will have to suspend your disbelief at times, but that is the nature of a genre which plays so enjoyably with scientific fantasies.",10
"So I'm going to make this as quick and as fair as I can. Whilst the show is actually good, and it was hard for my girlfriend and I to not watch it in one sitting. There were still some huge problems with the show and I'll just go over the 5 main ones:1. The show copied a lot of things from movies like 'Alien', 'E.T', 'Pulse', 'Carrie' and a dozen other movies. Watching Stranger Things is like watching a mix of many of the unique things that made other movies good (or bad). With some things it's really cool, but in others you get the feeling that the writers were really damn unoriginal.2. Some of the characters completely suck. The worst being 'Winona Ryder'. This b.... cries for tens of minutes every single episode. When she isn't crying, she's screaming about how she isn't crazy. We get that she's suffering like mad but they took her dramatic behaviour way, way too far. Honestly it gets to the point where it started to give us a physical headache and had us both shouting ""We get it already!"". The constant yelling (and fighting) from the kids also got a bit much too.3. There are BIG plot holes and I had some issues with some of the outcomes. Why did the 'Bad men' let Hopper live (but kill the cook at the start) and why did they just sit back and observe everyone instead of being more active about containing the situation? Why was Barb just completely forgotten? I mean we only see her mum make one concerned call about her… Also did you really have to steal the ending again, from Alien?4. A lot of the themes are ridiculous. Examples are when the kids are being actively chased by the 'bad men', 'El' just flips a car and they all decide to just stop chasing them. It's not like they couldn't have continued on after them. In general the 'bad men' are very well… bad, at tracking down a single girl who continuously leaves a path of destruction and chaos in her wake. Mike's father is also overly useless, and again Barb's mother… In fact all of the parents just seem to be really messed up in Hawkins.5. There's way too much feminism bullcrap going on in the movie. Insert the overweight, ginger lesbian, the androgynous looking female child lead with the shaved head with insane PTSD issues who is 'triggered' by everything. Oh, I almost forgot the token 'black kid' and the kid with a lisp. So that's: 1 'overweight ginger lesbian (wow killing 3 birds with 1 stone), 1 'person of colour', 1 'androgynous female with extreme PTSD' and 1 person with a birth defect. You could also throw Johnathan's extreme social awkwardness in there too and maybe the science teacher's Asian girlfriend.Putting all this aside the movie is definitely still interesting enough that it was hard for us to stop watching to go to sleep for the night. There's enough content for you to make some presumptions but not enough that you still end up getting a lot of things wrong. Though, at times the pacing is really slow and there's a lot of unnecessary stuff thrown in.Unfortunately, the biggest problem with the show is just the amount of hateable, badly developed or totally useless characters, and the undeniable incompetence of the 'bad men' and also Mike's parents are just so useless (really the father WTF). A lot of characters just feel like cannon fodder and give absolutely nothing to the setting or plot.I'll give it a 'B minus'. It's worth watching, but unless you're a potato, you will have your gripes with it when you're done.",6
"OK. I have decided that Stranger Things is kind of a kiddie ""Lost-wannabe"". I don't care what kind of ratings this show is pulling, it's really not that good. I'm trying, but i'm pretty sure it's going to fizzle out for me. I need more substance less blah blah blah. Right now it's hitting at a 4 for me. Whynona needs to take some meds. She's just not making it as a convincing character. My absolute favorite character is the chief of police. I do like him. The rest are just not very likable. And come on, the nose-bleeder really should've grasped some of the English language as she was talked to fairly normally even though she was in a very weird situation. Overall, the acting is mediocre to real bad and the storyline is mediocre to borrrring. I'm on episode six.....give me something.....I need something to keep me interested or yawn......zzzzzzzzzzzzzz.",4
"Absolutely in love with this show. Halfway through it just felt like a childhood favorite, one I could just ease into watching and feel so, so comfortable. You can definitely feel its Spielberg influence, and yet it manages to stand out among all other TV shows right now. It's a great blend of coming-of-age childhood drama, comedy, horror, and fantasy. I don't think it's always perfect, but it has such simple, great characters. Out of all of the Netflix shows I've seen as well, it's perhaps the one with the biggest heart. Such a joy to watch, I did not want to keep progressing though the season because I did not want it to end.",10
"When the trailer first came out, it didn't do much for me. It appeared to be just another generic thriller. However, I gave it a go one late night when I couldn't go to sleep and was immediately drawn in after the amazing title sequence. Not only does it set the tone for this 80's-inspired series by using the famous Stephen King book title font, but the theme track combined with the hypnotic movements of the letters falling into place is a pure joy to watch.""Stranger Things"" manages to give just enough answers to all our questions while at the same time giving us reason to want more. Unlike a lot of other shows these day, it is simple but effective at telling its story lines. There are a lot of nostalgia and references to the 80's childhood for the target audience to dwell in. Although the child actors aren't that great, their performances are innocent and heartfelt. Millie Bobby Brown however gives an amazing performance and I am sure we will see much more of her acting in the future.The episode run time of 40 minutes is ideal. These days it's hard to find anything else than comedy with a laughing track that keeps it so short. Unfortunately the show is over really fast too, but nothing good ever lasts, does it.",8
"Story was good not great but good,story telling and atmosphere was good, acting was generally good specially child actors acting was excellent. Surprisingly no hot chicks in an American Serries (lol). Only one thing was flawed and it was Winona Ryder. Such a terrible acting. If you pick random scenes of Winona's and what it without knowing the story line, you can not tell if she is afraid, surprised, worried or etc. etc. She was so fake every time she enters the scene and start talking i started to get bored. it is 9/10 without Winona Ryder but i must give -1 for Winona Ryder's terrible acting so 8 out of 10.Anyone would be perfect replacement for the Winona Ryder's part. Even Sandra Bullock could be better choice (lol) Of course she is as boring as Winona Ryder but at least she is not that fake.",8
"Not only because I come from Durham, Stranger Things gets my vote for best and most creative new development in film and video in many years. The brothers Duffy have woven a masterful story over 8 one-hour episodes, and maintained both quality and attention throughout. My only beefs are the (nowadays usual) use of near-whisper or unintelligible sounds in the dialogue, and an over-use of Shalyman-like darkness in too much of the critical ""other-world"" scenes (and in some of the regular-world ones, such as the swimming-pool sequence). The use of blinking overall-lighting and flashing light-darkness is also overdone, and distracts from several critical scenes. For film-makers this early in their game, these shortcomings are distracting but slight compared with their success in the storyline and general excellence in production. Hoping to be around long enough to see their talents develop fully.",10
"This show is essentially pandering to the masses who want something mindless and nostalgic that wraps up in a predictable, anti-climactic bow. Stranger Things does not deserve to share the same ratings with a masterpiece like True Detective. The acting is annoyingly terrible. The plot is predictable and disappointing. But if you're looking for a a feel-good, nostalgic 80s vibe - yet want to also feel like you're watching something edgy and creepy (which this isn't) then go for it.There was a point in one of the episodes where Nancy and Jonathan are shooting bottles and I said ""He's going to miss, then she's going to hit the bottle on her first shot, turn and give him a coy smile, and then its going to immediately cut to the next scene."" And that was literally shot for shot what happened. Is this a testament to me being psychic, or that this show is utterly predictable?The only thing that kept me watching until the very end was a hope that there would be some sort of interesting, clever turn - some sort of intelligent explanation for the events that beg all of the questions. But nope. The explanation that they give is so dull that my eyes nearly rolled out of my head. The whole concept of the sheet of paper, and the ""upside down."" Look, I love fantasy. And I'm all about accepting when there are things you aren't meant to know, but this was just annoying.And don't get me started on the child actors. They can't conduct a scene without escalating to full blown yelling within 20 seconds and frankly - its annoying as hell. Of course you can't expect Oscar winning performances from children, but the Directors here could have provided at least the simple direction to not be yelling 99% of the time.I literally made an account on IMDb just to make this review. I feel like I'm the only person out there who sees this show for being the total crap that it is.",4
E.T meets Goonies and Resident Evil with Nostalgic Tron overtone.Horror combined with Telepathy - it's all going on.Short and simple - some series can over-do it with episodes but this was kept nice and simple.Not for kids -unless you want them to have nightmaresAction starts from beginning so it's not a slow burner.Hope you guys enjoy it. Lights turned off and volume turned up ;)Winona Ryder and the little girls acting is brilliant.I have to write an extra line in order to have this review posted but wanted to keep it short and simple.,8
"I read here and there some comments about this show and how great it is. This and ratings on IMDb mean nothing. Nowadays TV shows became so bad that even the biggest crap is glorified.The moment i started watching the show, seeing four boys are playing dungons and dragons, that gave me a smile and remembered me about my own childhood. But i was highly suspicious because of the black boy.I thought the moment they will glorify this black kid as especially brave, super talented or smarter then everyone else i will switch this thing off and forget about it. Because i am just sick of the political correctness bull where they always add some under laying social education to every show. The same i thought about overly heroic girls or any social justice non sens which may appear.But it never happened. The black kid was just a kid, the girl even when she had super powers was just a 12 year old girl and acted like one. Not only one social justice propaganda or even any cliché was seen in the whole series.To be honest, i binge watched it! :) It was brilliant. Just a good story, very well acted and the characters where just regular people. Enjoyable from the beginning to the end.And that's how you not suck at making a good TV show. Just stick by your story and spare us the social education.",10
"I admit that When you watch the first episode, it makes want to watch them all. At the end, you wont waste your time, but you want get some masterpiece of a show that you may be searching for. The casting is very good. I also liked the whole 80s atmosphere that creators want to get. It has perfect soundtrack, something that makes the show more likable. But nevertheless, at the end of it all you get the feeling like it is ""Steven King wanna be"" movie or ""Twin Peaks for kids"" or ""Darker version of E.T"". While you watch it, it brings nostalgia for all that 80s movies. And the creators get that feeling very good. You kinda think that it was really shoot at the 80s. Not the best show on earth, but worth watching. Seven from ten from me.",7
"I didn't believe the hype when this show first hit Netflix. Everyone was talking about it and I figured it was just some stupid show. I was completely wrong. I just non-stop watched the whole first season and it blew me away. It literally is as far up my alley as something can be. It's got an 80's setting complete with synthesizers and a slight film grain, thriller drama elements, super powers, monsters, an alternate reality, top notch acting, an excellent score with the appropriate 80's soundtrack and an insanely good gripping story. I enjoyed this show so much and I encourage anyone who enjoys being entertained to watch this show. After finishing it I feel weird and attached to the characters in a way that only the best movie and TV shows can do to you and I can not wait until season 2. The Duffer brothers have an enormous and well deserved success to follow up and hopefully they can pull it off.",9
"This is what happens when you let the writers write a show the way it should be written. From what I know, around 20 networks told the brothers who wrote this that they should make a simple, one-dimensional series for dumb people. The brothers stuck to their vision because they wanted to make an amazing series and look what happened - they succeeded, because it turns out that viewers aren't as dumb as show producers think they are. If you know anything about storytelling, you will be blown away by what the writers have done here. The '80s details are one thing, the many references to classic and cult movies are another, but there is so much more to this. The child actors, for example, who were born already in the 21st century, are nothing like contemporary actors. They're just like Goonies, and I can't believe that they managed to act like that if they probably haven't even seen any '80s movies.Then there's the story, or rather 4 of them, perfectly blended together. How new events of each story are presented bit by bit is just brilliant. Writers of 99% of of modern TV shows have no idea about what pacing is or what makes viewers care about the characters. In 'Stranger Things' the viewer connects with the characters immediately. You watch it and cherish every moment. I never liked Winona Ryder, her acting was always stiff to me. Here, she's totally brilliant, as is everyone else. It's as if you've time-travelled and you're watching stuff happen in a small town for real. It's so realistic.Another amazing thing about this show is that there is hardly any CGI, or at least it's used in such a way that it doesn't show. Back in the '80s there was no CGI and movie-makers had to have sets built from scratch. Imagine how much work it took to make 'Terminator'. This show looks like it was mostly created by hand, except maybe the monster.Next thing: dialogues. They sound so natural and so cool, especially the kids' dialogues, but other characters also have realistic lines, it's just such a pleasure to listen to people talk in this show. It's almost music to the ears because you don't hear good dialogue these days anymore, it's always stiff, cliché-ridden, pompous, and the like. Here, you hear people talk as they usually talk. Again, it's like you ended up in the '80s for real.'Midnight special', a movie that came out recently, got good reviews from the critics, who said that it's very good despite the obvious reference to 'E.T.' Well, like many other movies, that one was pretty much a cookie-cutter movie, full of overused lines and tricks. In 'Stranger Things' you see a lot of things borrowed from other movies and '80s books but the show is still fresh and original, and it's beyond me how they managed to create the same kind of atmosphere that you would've seen in those movies from 30 years ago.I hope that in season 2 the writers will keep up the good work because it would be a shame if they didn't. This is a must-see for everyone. It will make you recall at least 20 movies from when you were a kid. I'm just wondering what it's like for those born in the late '90s and later, that is those who don't know a world without the internet and cell phones and who've never seen the kind of clothes that the characters of 'Stranger Things' are wearing, or cars, or phones. When the mother of one kid says that they can go to the movie store together, that's bound to raise a few eyebrows.The funniest thing about 'Stranger Things' is that even though we're surrounded by technology, and everyone's on Facebook and Instagram, and we're glued to our cell phones, you can watch this show and not realize that none of this stuff exists in the show's reality. You will be so immersed that it will all seem natural - the fact that kids don't play computer games in their free time or the fact that you have to develop a camera film in the dark room. If you've lived through the '80s, you will easily forget the 21st century for the duration of the show.I hope Netflix will become THE network to go to if you want to watch a great show. Perhaps the dumbing down process can slowly be reversed and other networks will follow suit when they realize there's money to be made from interesting, cleverly-written and beautifully produced series. They don't make them like they used to but who says they can't again?",9
"Stranger Things is a lot of things. It's a series about monsters; a science fiction story about secret government testing; it's about a mother searching for her missing son and dealing with grief; it's the awkward teen romance; it's also a story about childhood friendship. At its heart though, this is a show about childhood and adolescence. When you are growing up, a young person's life revolves around the small world he/she creates for him/herself. One doesn't think about the hard realities or question the boundaries of what is and isn't possible. And Stranger Things really excels at taking you back and making you experience that childhood nostalgia. I often felt, that I was watching an X-Files episode, Super 8, or a Spielberg movie.Usually in family oriented TV shows revolving around adults and kids, what ends up happening is that the story is often told from the perspective of the parents'. ""We,""the audience, experience the kids through the lens of their parents, or any other adults in the story. We see the hardships and joy adults face dealing with kids. But, here, radically enough for 8 episodes, the three kids in the story Lucas, Dustin, and Mike are in charge of their own world. They are legitimate, willful agents of their own story. Their parents are at best bystanders; sometimes watching the antics with disinterest or mild frustration, and other times wholly ignorant of the adventures these kids go through.One never doubts, that Stranger Things is a story of the kids, as they unravel the mystery of their missing friend Will, and make a new friend with Eleven. The adults exist in the minds of the kids' in the murky periphery; not always as allies or confidantes, in fact the adults are only vaguely visible, coming in and out of focus.For more visit www.artspeaksy.com",9
"Stranger Things, is the series that's so simple yet intelligently made that when you have to explain it in words to friends it sounds so complex!This is the show which anyone can understand! Young adults e.g. 16 upwards to people the age of 40+ can all understand and reference different things inside the show!This summer i was debating between watching either Stranger Things or Narcos and lets just say i've been able to start Narcos! I finished Stranger Things in 2 days! This show keeps you hooked constantly and leaves you becoming a character inside the show, the viewer can relate to any character in every episode!All in all this show is a masterpiece from Netflix! Let's just say AMC and other series creators have some serious standards now, Netflix keep up the good work!",10
"""9/10!"" the reviews state on IMDb and other news publicity sites. I like Science Fiction and lots of people have been talking about Stranger Things on netflix. It's a show that is influenced by 80's sci- fi and action movies. Everything about this is from the 80s. It's basically for nostalgia-philes. Friends recommended me this show because I like the X Files. I checked out the first episode. It seemed to have OK action scenes. The monster, whatever it was, seemed pretty cool, but you rarely see it. Most of the show is Drama. I got really annoyed at the actors very quickly (Except for the reluctant cop Jim Hopper played by David Harbour, whom I thought was quite funny) Winona Ryder (Will's mother) really irritates me. Her over acting is unnecessary. It's filled with cheesy 80s nostalgia and Hollywood B-Grade movie Clichés. I was expecting better, but I don't think i'd stick around for this one.",3
"Its The Best Fiction Show.The Story Building Is Very Slow But Very Interesting. Acting Of All Crew Is Very Good. The Way Story Goes, Pretty Classic But Very Interesting. If U Like Si-Fi And Other Fiction Show Than U Will Definitely Like It Condition To Have Some Patience As Story Is Very Slow Moving And Classic. But Direction And Story Line Is Very Strong. In Starting It Feels Like Very Slow Moving And For A Time Being It Became Boring, But As Story Goes Further There Is Element Of Surprise And Secrete That Make This Show Very Interesting. A Group Of Smart And Talented Kids And Their Unity Makes It Very Good. In Short If U Are Fiction Lover And Little Bit Patient U Should Definitely Watch It.",9
"Absolutely amazed and astounded with the quality, emotion, thrill and story behind this top notch show. Set with an awesome blend of 80s X-Files/Modern Sci-Fi Thriller, this makes it to my all time favorites.Gripping and inspiring from start to finish, there is no chance this show can waste your time. Well paced, with a great cast and attachment to characters, my appreciation only got better as I watched.This is one of those shows that deserves your time. I can only think of someone being dissatisfied with this if they genuinely disliked the genre and were very picky. Cannot stress how much I recommend this, and to me and many others, it deserves all 10 of its stars.Whether you're into a bit of drama, a horror/thriller, some Sci-Fi, government conspiracy, psychic powers, a classic crime story or young love, Stranger Things packs it all into a fantastic experience you won't forget any time soon.",10
"I had heard a lot of praise for this show, but I wasn't all that interested, at first. I knew it was, basically, a love letter to classic Spielberg and Stephen King, both of whom I am a very big fan, but I had seen J.J. Abrams' Super 8, and, while it was good, I felt it was a bit lacking in the magic that Spielberg and King had always perfected.Not the case with this show.One night I just decided to start it, because I was looking for a good 80s movie to watch. Very first shot, with the guy in the lab coat, running away, I was instantly engaged, wanting to know what was happening. In my opinion, the girl, named Eleven, steals the show, even from well-known actors like Winona Ryder, David Harbour, and Matthew Modine. The three main protagonists, the boys, are a close second. These four kids are just amazing and have really good acting chops.Many plot points are taken from classic 80s movies, with a lot of throwbacks to Alien, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, E.T. and countless others. There are people disappearing in a small rural town in the 80s and there are some ""strange things"" happening. The suspense, the mystery, the horror, the emotion, are all spectacular and it's all set against a perfectly realized 1980s backdrop. I can't wait for season 2!",10
What can I say? Felt like I was back in 1982!!!!! Amazing!!! Superb!!!! Great acting!!!!! Excellent effects!!! Great story!!!!! Great writing!!!! Can't wait for season 2!!!!!!!! Bring it on!!!!!! Need more shows like this!!! At last no more Hollywood remakes!!!! Less drama more intrigue!!!! Please don't waste season 2:) Keep what works!!!!!Seriously this deserved the applause it's getting!Well done Netflix!!!!You really scored high!!!Keep up the same tempo!!!Don't ruin it please!!!!!,10
"I wasn't sure about this series at first, but I heard such great stuff about the series from my brother, so I decided to give the series a watch. And wow I was amazed how the series keeps you glued on happens next.Set in 1983, and it feels like it was made in that decade, the filmmakers even use an 80's like soundtrack. The story is quite an awesome mystery each episode is like puzzle you slowly put together. An awesome blend of horror and sci-fi. The actors all play there parts really well, David Harbour is great has the sheriff, times he comes across like a ticking time bomb just waiting to go off. Winona Ryder is great has a mother, don't care what other people say about her performance, I thought she really delivered. And the other young actors are awesome here, they all just keep you watching. And now I'm waiting for season 2.",9
"Stranger Things is nothing more than Cut - copy & paste TV series. Cast is decent ..makeups are good but direction and story are too bad.So called inspiration from various sources just feel like you are watching Steven Spielberg + John Carpenter + Stephen King's movies at the same time. which is not very pleasant experience.The story revolve around a lost child and their friends and family trying to find him.I can't go into great detail because there are so many flaws in direction and story that its not possible to explain all of them here. But they says that ""even a good cast cannot save a bad story"".Even though there are plenty of thrilling and exciting moments but they don't make much sense as don't understand the story and whats going on.Seems like directors were confused and they are trying to make viewer even more confused.Folks just do a favor please done make a season 2 of this series.Thanks Best of Luck",1
"This show will be a classic, well it is for me already. it takes place in the early eighties! There is not much greatness in the Eighties but this definitely changes opinions. Like all Netflix shows, the actors were on point, they all seamed to have perfect chemistry. The show was sort of dark, eerie, but had humor here and there, all in the best kind of way. ever since watching this I've been curious to watch the x files series because that's what it reminds me of. I seriously cant wait to watch season 2, especially after watching the trailer for it, so much mystery I highly recommend this show to everyone, now find out for yourself!",9
"I was full of hope when I watched the pilot for this highly rated and very popular series. After the pilot I was bewildered as to why the vast number of viewers have given this wishy-washy show such outrageously high ratings! There is nothing new being done here and the quality is mediocre, IMHO!But I decided to watch another episode, just in case the material got better. I, however, gave up towards the end of it. I found it so boring and basically just annoying. This series hardly deserves even one star; it's dreadful!I found the acting to be mostly mediocre, as well as the material. Winona Ryder is overplaying her role with too much hysteria. Other actors are just so so...",1
"I'll start this with a little game myself and my friends engaged in two hours into this series: Guess the next line of dialogue?Will they say this? Yes! Funny.Will they say that? Yes. Amusing.Surely, they won't say this. Yes. Fun factor now worn thin.I cannot guess correctly five times in a row? Why, yes, sir, you can.Inspired by Steven King, Twin Peaks, or whatever other I've heard this referred to, it may have some merit but only in that the producers found a way of taking the best of those and others that went before it and reduced that artistry to the lowest common denominator, removing all originality, inspiration and insight. I thought after 2 hours I was actually watching a cartoon for 10 year olds.Now, maybe I should have given it more than 2 hours.Maybe, if I had tits, I could be my Aunt Agatha.No.Who is voting for this shallow dishwater?It's been done before, often, almost invariably better.",1
"Fantastic show, I could break it down, launch into a whole series of theories, comparisons to like movies and spoilers; but I'll spare everyone. I will say I love the fact it's not just the kids, all ages get involved in the mystery.Well done to the Duffer Brothers and to Netflix for making this happen. GREAT acting, Winona who knew! The kids, Harbour, Modine, wow, awesome casting and work by the cast! If you've not seen the first season, be prepared to binge as it's hard to stop watching.Thank you Netflix and Duffers, can't wait to see what's next and I can't wait for Season 2!!!",10
"I am typically very critical of TV shows and films, and recently there is very little that truly astonishes me. ""Stranger Things"" absolutely blew my mind and won my heart. However, with over 400 user reviews already posted here, there isn't much I can say that hasn't already been said. So I'll just say a few things:This series is just incredible, and it's like nothing I've ever seen before, be it a TV series or a film. It reminds me very much of the type of horror films that John Carpenter has made, and Stephen King to a lesser extent. All the same, it's very much in line with 80's & 90's sci-fi horror. The period style of the series, which is the late 1980's, was done incredibly well. If you remember--or grew up during--the years between 1985 and 1995 like I did, then you will genuinely appreciate the little things in this series, as the period-correct atmosphere & set design makes it all the more enjoyable.ALL of the actors did an amazing job, the cinematography is incredible, as are the set designs, costumes, special effects, sound; absolutely everything is positively excellent in quality and in it's delivery. I've never seen anything done this well in this genre since the early movies which inspired it. There simply isn't anything bad that I can say about this show! Since I've begun reviewing movies & shows on IMDb, I've never given anything a 10/10, and I take that ""award"" very seriously, but ""Stranger Things"" totally deserves it! If you are a fan of 80's and 90's sci-fi & horror, this show was made for you. Even if you just want a real good, gripping, scary thriller to get into, this is it. It's a truly amazing piece of work! Bravo!",10
"With all the hype about ""Stranger Things"" and with so many friends and colleagues watching it, I came about and had to watch it as well. And sat down to watch all episodes of the first season on two evenings.While ""Stranger Things"" certainly is entertaining, it is not all that Regardless, it should be said that ""Stranger Things"" is entertaining, and the storyline is well-thought through and equally so executed on the screen at the hands of directors Matt Duffer and Ross Duffer. They managed to build up a good continuation of the story and fair level of mystery.However, there were aspects of the series that didn't really appeal all that well to me. For example, the whole thing with the strange girl good as the hype had it made up to be. Perhaps this was because I was expecting something more grand from the series, giving all the hype.Known as ""11"". Sure, she was vital to the storyline, but personally I didn't care much for her story and her contribution to it. Mind you, that I am not saying that Millie Bobby Brown didn't act well, because she most certainly did.And while we are on the topic of actors, then it should be said that they had managed to get to get a great ensemble of acting talents, both familiar and new faces. And they all contributed quite well to the series. I especially enjoyed Winona Ryder (playing Joyce Byers) and David Harbour (playing Jim Hopper).The effects in ""Stranger Things"" were good, and used in fair moderation. Personally I think it was a bit of a shame that they held back with the special effects, because it would have spiced up the show so much more.The creature was nicely made and had some good design. But it was just too easily defeated in my opinion, which was somewhat of an anti-climatic moment.There is certainly a good amount of H. P. Lovecraft and Spielberg influence behind the construction of ""Stranger Things"" and it reflects on the screen.It was a great treat to witness the amount of effort they had gone through to make the magic of the 1980s come back to life. And they did that quite successfully. And as a fan of the Dungeons & Dragons game, it was a wonderful treat with the element of D&D shown in ""Stranger Things"".""Stranger Things"" was entertaining enough, but I felt sort of disappointed, because I had initially expecting something much more grand and memorable. But still, it was fun to watch. And as such, I am rating ""Stranger Things"" six out of ten stars; based on what I have seen in season one only.",6
"Allow me to explain myself when it comes to my standards: I want something that amazes me. I want something with outstanding writing, appearance, acting, characters, and I judge my entries with those categories in mind.Writing Stranger Things, I believe, excelled in this area most of the time. The plot moved forward at a reasonable pace. Nothing felt too rushed or too dragged out. However, several things that occur felt too forced in without consulting common logic first. I'm mostly talking about Hawkins' decision to let the chief go free. Let's review: he broke into a government facility, saw some top-secret classified stuff, and his only punishment is a wiretap in (only) his house? This honestly feels like the writers were pushed into a corner with no logical way out. Another point to consider is the fact that nothing is either explained or implied; we, the audience, are just supposed to accept that happens with nothing built on top. What is this Upside-Down? Is it the work of supernatural forces? Aliens? Science gone wrong? What about the Hawkins' laboratory? Are there other kids part of the experiments? How did 11 manage to escape in the first place? How did the chief get to the bottom floor of a top-secret government facility without so much as a gun shot at him? Aside from this nit-picking, the writing is solid throughout, but lacks logic when need be. Score: 7/10Appearances: This is where Stranger Things truly shines. The directing does a beautiful job of bringing out those intense scenes. The visuals are nothing short of stunning. If I had to give a complaint, it would be ""Does the Upside-Down have to be completely gray?"". The music only further emphasizes the emotion and impact of every scene. It's actually a memorable score, the title card theme being the shining example of that. Score: 10/10Acting: A shining, but less impactful element in Stranger Things. The emotions that the characters bring are truly something to gawk at. The main problem with having a primary cast of children is usually the acting, and this is no exception. A lot of the acting done by the kids feels over-dramatized to the point of being hilarious. Winona Ryder I think carried the series with her amazing portrayal of a mother on the verge of insanity. Every time she was on screen I was prepared to see some crazy stuff happen. Score: 8/10Characters: Something Stranger Things fails at is having believable characters. While the plot chugs away doing its thing, it leaves no room for character familiarity or development. The main character, Mike, is a typical middle schooler that plays D&D with his friends: Dustin, the typical gluttonous kid, Lucas, whose only character trait is being jealous of Mike and having a dad that fought in Vietnam, and Will, who gets around 15 minutes of total screen time. Got to include not one, but two sets of two-dimensional bullies! I wish Steve got more screen time, as the series ended just as he was becoming interesting. Nancy has no personality at all. She can shoot a gun, and that's the only character trait she has. Jonathan also suffers from having pretty much no personality. He's shown as being a loner in school and a member of the photography club, but that's all there is to his character. The rest of the characters have even less personality; they're just stuck in as filler characters so the scenes would be less lonely. At least Hopper and Joyce were interesting, albeit also a bit lacking. Score: 2/10Stranger Things has a few things going for it, but not enough to be too excited over. The writing was solidly done, but lacking in logic at times. The appearances are nothing short of breathtaking, each moment being encapsulated with a score and visuals to remember. The acting was all-around solidly done. The kids, however, ruin the immersion of having believable people be part of the story. The characters fell completely flat, as every single one has a few bullet points attached to their name. None of them come off as believable people, just as plot points in a story.Final Score: 7/10More Personal Thoughts: Here's how you check to see if your characters come off as people. If you remember their name hours after you finished watching, then you've at least partially succeeded. I had to keep referencing the cast list because I forgot almost all of the characters' names.",7
"Dungeons & Dragons, Eggo Waffles, Winona Ryder in Mom Jeans, Super Powers, and More in Netflix's 'Stranger Things'!'Stranger Things' Season 1 is The Hit Show of The Summer!What can I say about Netflix's hit original series Stranger Things that hasn't already been said? I know I am a little late to the party. But, Stranger Things is one of the best Netflix original series you should definitely be watching! If you were a child of the 1980s, or if you simply are a fan of the films of the 1980s, Netflix's new series Stranger Things will satisfy you, entertaining you, creep you out, and overall it's a blast!This thrilling Netflix original stars award-winning actress Winona Ryder (Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands) as Joyce Byers, who lives in a small Indiana town with her older son in 1983. When Joyce's 12-year-old son, Will, played by Noah Schnapp (Bridge of Spies) goes missing, she launches an investigation with the local police chief Jim Hooper, played by David Harbour (The Equalizer, A Walk Among the Tombstones) into his disappearance. As they search for answers, they unravel a series of extraordinary mysteries involving secret government experiments, and unnerving supernatural forces. Meanwhile, Will's three friends are also determined to find him when they find a scared girl, played by Millie Brown (2014s Intruders television show) who calls herself Eleven (after the numeric tattoo on her arm) and possesses supernatural abilities.Okay for starters, let's talk about the characters. You care what happens to ALL the characters in Stranger Things, because they're written authentically and they're cast exceptionally, especially when it comes to the kids. The kids come off as real kids, and what real kids would do in these types of situations. Brown, makes Eleven scary, sad, funny and sweet, especially in scenes shared with the other kids. I believe she is the breakout star in this series. Gaten Matarazzo's Dustin, may be short on teeth but long on hilarious dialogue, and grew on me with each episode. As did Ryder, the chief of police, the kids, and all the characters. You want to see these characters proved right, you want them to seek justice, and you want the underdogs to win. Every character is so well written and rounded, that I found myself emotionally connecting to every single character.From the moment Stranger Things begins, you can feel the influences that have guided series creators Matt Duffer and Ross Duffer (Wayward Pines). The film is flooded with '80s nostalgia. To me, this feels like a Stephen King book. That have would have become a movie, directed by Steven Spielberg or John Carpenter (or both!). Obviously, the risk is that this could all just feel like a tribute that's fun, but with no real identify of its own. However, Stranger Things manages to create a compelling world of its own, centered on a group of very relatable, likable characters, an interesting story, and entertaining.Style over Substance?Even though this series takes place in the '80s, it takes more place in the movies of the 80s. Meaning, this ""real"" world that we're watching feels more like a '80s film we would have watched. One small complaint I have is the story could have been just a little bit more original. It's cool the show has all these cool little Easter eggs to the '80s. However, some of the things that happen in the series, you will know it from other iconic '80s films. Such as, films like E.T. The Goonies, and Carrie.T his show isn't just for fans of the '80s and people who grew up in that era. I feel like this is a series everyone can enjoy. Even though I am curious to what today's youth audience would think of this film. Would they enjoy and respect the series like some of the older viewers? So these are my final Bitchin' Buddha thoughts on Netflix's original series Stranger Things season one. It's an interesting blend of horror, comedy, drama, science fiction, nostalgia, and I believe this series is extremely well done. It is something you can watch alone, by yourself, over again, and there is something here for everyone. I believe Stanger Things season one earns a9/10!And just like a Christmas present I'm gonna wrap this up. Until next time, this review is brought to you by Boogie Buddha, and remember, don't just get down, but get Boogie. Thank you all for reading and or viewing, and I hope you all have an amazing day as always. Peace out. :)",9
"I have recommended this show to all my friends. And most of them love it too. So much fun. I really miss the 80's. I was a little nerd myself. This was so exciting and fresh. It got me hooked after the first episode. Netflix and HBO are the kings of series. I thinks it's so awesome how big and good Netflix has become. They keep making excellent series. I also really love Narcos. That show too is really good.I am looking forward to season 2 of this show. I was so glad when I read that the season 2 was coming next year. To all the people that make this happened at Netflix, Thank You. You make my life better. And Thank You creators and actors of this show, for making me forget about all that is bad in life. Taking me with to this new world.This really is nothing short of a home run. Bravo! :)",10
"Firstly, don't get me wrong; the casting, acting, direction, editing and visuals here are second to none.But I really don't get the show. Admittedly I'm only half way through season 1, so my opinions might change, but I just don't get all the praise for the show. It's just, to me anyway, a ""throw it all in and hope for the best"" mix of previous 80's hits.So. You've got a bunch of kids chasing something they don't know or understand. They work out some weird meaning that the adults simply wont understand and they go on a crazy secret mission to catch the bad guys. It's all very Goonies/BMX Bandits. Then it goes into a modern horror Hemlock Grove type adult horror territory entering an utterly genreless confusion.Its like Spielberg took a Stephen King story and asked John Carpenter to direct it. And John Carpenter said, ""F%%% off, do it yourself"". So it ended up a potentially good horror ruined by Spielberg family values and cuddliness.Like I say, it is well directed and acted and looks great. All the 80's stuff is cool (except for the almost constant and monotonous 80's electro duna duna duna duna background music which seems cool at first but soon becomes really annoying).But if you want 80's cute kids having adventures, watch The Goonies or BMX Bandits again. If you want weird horror goings on in a grown person environment, watch Hemlock Grove.But like I say, I'm only half way through the first season . . . .21/09/2016. Watched final episode and my opinion is . . . .It's not a kids thing, it's not a grown ups thing, it's not even a tweeny thing. It is A thing, of sorts. And there's bound to be second season. I'll probably watch and complain about that too.",7
"The only thing missed was Michael Knight and his trans-am. The creators did a tremendous job capturing the aura of an era, I don't think I can contribute with something about this series that it hasn't been told yet, It's hard for me to give an honest evaluation because it makes you nostalgic since the intro,so I found my self emotionally compromised, the setting is just amazing.They did a great cast selection,it's the first time in a very long that I don't find the acting-kids annoying, the only thing I can complain of is that it could have been more suspense's scenes, but in my opinion we have another great and laudable piece by our friends of Netflix.",9
"I found this series on Netflix not so long ago, at first I wasn't quite sure whether or not I liked it. It was a bit hard to follow at the beginning, but by the third episode I was caught. There were a few times when I wasn't sure what was going on. But, I must admit, I love it and wish season two was on Netflix.The story line is original and I find myself very intrigued to find out what happens next. I have also found myself contemplating what might happen.I would recommend this to anyone who loves supernatural or mystery orientated shows.And one request: Netflix, please release season two!",8
"Yes, i like! Very much! Didn't expect it was so good. I am hooked. WhatI don't like are the scary parts. Not a big fan of scary stuff. I like the science-fiction, the 80s, the soundtrack, the mystery. Well written, well directed. Very good cast. AND that it is ""inspired and aesthetically informed by the works of Steven Spielberg, John Carpenter, Stephen King, Robert Zemeckis and George Lucas, among others."" (wikipedia) Just cool to watch, I just forget everything around me and am 100% focused on what happens. So GREAT =) I want this series to last for at least more than ## seasons. Thers is so much potential to so it could last for so much more seasons than the first end the scond that is coming in spring of 2017. Please let it last!!! THANX",9
"My daughter in college called me and said ""Mom you have to watch this new show on Netflix."" Her and her boyfriend sat and watched all 8 shows. I looked at it and thought not another alien kid show. My husband and I sat down and was hooked after the first show! We also watched all 8 shows. I liked the fact it was clean. I get so tired of shows basing everything with foul mouths and sex in every other shot. You can let your kids watch it and not worry when you get up for the popcorn that they are going to have their little minds corrupted, But watch out it is spooky, but also funny. I fell in love with all the characters. The only thing I don't like is I have to wait till next year for the show!! UGH!! Good job guys.",9
"I usually don't like the Science fiction type, but with all the hype around"" The Stranger Things""I decided to give it a try . And I wasn't disappointed, in fact I new by the 5/10 first minutes that I was going to look the whole season . The actors was so good, especially the kids , which usually are not so great in other TV shows ( Walking dead for instance ) The 80's era was totally there, even If I was born in the late 80's I could feel the atmosphere .The cool thing about that Show is that each episode are increasing in intensity as long as you are progressing .I didn't gave a 10 stars because , first the perfection doesn't exist ^^, and secondly because sometimes it felt a little bit too much cliché( I wouldn't say predictable )which make me fell feel that there was a little bit of lack of originality . Having said that, I got to tell that it's one of the best TV show that it was given me to watch, top ten for sure !",9
"I think it's a series that works if you did not see any other series in your life, but as we have several top ... I found it boring and predictable. The performances are fine, no big deal. There is no character to stand out or wanting to know more. The plot is incoherent and has absurd moments. There are several events and situations of the series that made me ask, ""Really?"". Moments where the courage of some characters becomes impossible to believe; moments where science fiction and suspense are distorted by the illogical and unreasonable actions ... I think that a plot can play with unintelligible, enigmatic and irrational but always maintaining a certain internal consistency, with believable characters who were developing their skills and potential throughout history. Here many issues for granted are met, we move from fear to action without any mediation. Scenes that seem serious arise and end up being naive. They try to create an atmosphere of mystery that quickly becomes imbecility. Anyway, it seems a bad series. Maybe would have worked a little better as a movie.",3
"I agree that viewers can fill in some details, but there are so many logical flaws in this show which contradicts with itself. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying the show is bad. Actually I pretty enjoy the show, the costumes and scenes are pretty real. The actors are acting well, especially for those kids. However one of joys I have during the time watching the show is to see how many logical flaws it has. Here is some I can remember now:1. Why did they (lab guys) kill the big cook but not sheriff? The big cook (at beginning) just met a lost girl and report to government. They can simply pretend as government employee (they do have the power to do it) who are supposed to take care of lost kids and pick the girl up. It's definitely not necessary to kill a guy. OK, we can just accept this as an assumption in the show: they are evil guys. Their working style is killing people to cover up the truth to make 100% sure for their secrets. Then why they didn't kill the sheriff? He definitely knows much more secret since he has already got into the lab and seen a lot of secrets. Is it just because he is one of the main characters?2. Why did the lab guys want to make a fake body of lost kid? First of all, why did they think the lost boy had any relations with their lab or secret. The boy was caught by the monster, the lab guys should not even know it. During that time, they didn't even know much about the monster or if it has offensive action. (They sent a single guy without power weapon or good supports later and didn't expect the death of that man.) OK, we can accept that they are too nervous and believe the lost boy is caused by their secret project. Then if they really want to cover up their secret, they need to let as less people involved as possible and treat that accident as a normal lost kid case (Sending some Amber Alert on highway or similar...). Then after several months, no one except the parents would care about it. However what they did was calling up tens of cops and several ambulance to perform a big show (for whom?), making a big news to let everyone in the world knows the accident, and then they made a fake body by some kind of silicon skin with cotton stuffing... Are you serious?3. How did Will contact with his mother? It seems that several assumptions had made for this: (a) The upside down world has exact same objects as the real world (street, house...); (b) People in the upside down world can hear the sound from real world, but cannot see anything in the real world (people, fire...) (c) When people in the upside down world getting close to light bubble, the bubble in real world will on. However how did Will figure that he can light on the bubbles in the real world? He cannot see anything happened in the real world. Then how could he know to light the bubble on by going close to it?Alright, we can assumption Will is a really really smart and brave boy and he was staying home all the time and listening to his mother's response to the light and eventually figured out this mechanism. Then how did he send words to his mother? I mean when his mother paints the characters on the wall, can Will see the same character at the same position in the upside down world? Can Will see the same light bubble there too? ?I didn't see them at the upside down scene.) If yes, did he see some bubbles flying in the air when his mother setting these bubbles? Did he see the door opening and closing by itself when his brother getting in and out the house at real world? Why they cannot see something like fire, bat or all these stuffs when sheriff and Will's mother came to his house? What will it response in the real world if they damage something in the upside down world?All these basic assumptions about environmental correlation between two worlds are full of flaws. It seems they made assumption at first and then twisted it whenever the story needs.There are still a lot flaws I didn't mention. Such as:4. How did the monster travel between two worlds (Need the gate or not)?5. How could sheriff get into the big lab building for the first time without any preparation or guide then directly get to the most inner and secret room? (The building was full of camera and guards).6. If three teenagers with only a small gun, a trap, gas fire can stop and beat the monster away, why not tens of trained guys with machine guns cannot do the same thing? What's more ironically, even 3 kids with a small slingshot can slow down the monster.7. If the monster is sensitive to blood, the first thing it would get probably is the fresh meet in kitchen, right? (Now I'm kidding :) )",7
"Stranger Things (2016): Stranger things is the most hyped and critically acclaimed series of 2016.I just couldn't stop myself writing this review after watching its finale.So how is it?Plot:On November 6, 1983 in the town of Hawkins,Indiana, 12-year-old Will Byers (Noah Schnapp) vanishes mysteriously. Will's frantic mother, Joyce (Winona Ryder), searches for him while Police Chief Jim Hopper (David Harbour) launches his own investigation. Will's friends Mike (Finn Wolfhard),Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) and Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin) discover a psychokinetic girl named Eleven (Millie Brown) who claims to know Will's location.Mike's sister Nancy (Cara Buono) who has in relationship with Steve (Joe Keery) teams up with Jonathan Bryers (Charlie Heaton),brother of Will Bryers to investigate the mystery of the disappearance of her friend Barbara (Shannon Purser). As all of them uncover the truth, a sinister government agency tries to cover it up, while a more insidious force lurks below the surface.Plus Points:1)Performances: Casting is the major highlight of Stranger Things.Each and every actor in this series played their roles with perfection.We cannot highlight any one because everyone gave award winning performance.Winona Ryder as grieving mother,Millie Brown as psycho kinetic girl,the kids,Charlie Heaton,Cara Buono, everyone are brilliant.This show is a proof of true hidden talents.2)Engaging screenplay: Stranger Things is highly engaging in every episode.There is exactly no dull moments in all of the eight episodes.Every episode has its own mark and ends with suspense note.The way they showed all the stories in parallel way is brilliant as all of them got equal priority.It is emotional,scary,thrilling,cute and some times funny too.3)Direction: Stranger Things can be considered as an exceptional hard work of The Duffer brothers.These guys are brilliant and got success in bringing a masterpiece in retro style.Though they got inspired from 80's style works of Spielberg's The Goonies where bunch of kids try to solve a mystery.Its their vision which made this show a masterpiece.4)Setting: The way they showed the setting of 1980's is awesome,They are so real that we can easily get dragged into the show.5)Music: Music in Stranger Things is terrific and played a crucial role in its pacing,Especially its theme is haunting and never leaves our mind.Minus Points: There are none but I feel that VFX is bit poor.So,Stranger Things is one of the best TV series of all time.It is brilliant engaging drama thriller where every minute keeps you at the edge of the seat for entire 8 episodes.Waiting for season 2.My rating 10/10",10
"I grew up watching a lot of 90's show where the main protagonist has some kind of super powers and this show is no different.The fact that it's tagged as Horror has nothing to do with ""horror"". Its like a toned down version of E.T movie for 8 year old kids.The show is mostly about a bunch of kids fighting to make themselves heard in an adult world, this is why this show is so popular among kids. The ""horror"" part of the movie is just an after thought.Stranger things keeps baiting the audience by dangling little hints of horror and super powers in 3 secs scenes just to keep the audience entertained and hooked, but the rest of the screen time is just petty problems of kids and adolescents trying to do the right things.",1
Absolutely no original ideas in it!! Everything is so predictable... Not bad but far from good. You have to be 10 years old (or a lady Xerox-gaga fan) to be overwhelmed by this show which is just a copy of what has been done before. A very big disappointment! Everything here has been seen over and over again on screen and TV series so nothing to be surprised about. You can see from far what's coming up way before it actually happens. Of course it's all about the 80th but some original ideas would have been more than welcome. Nice series to watch but not much more than a 6/10. There is so many more series that are way better than this one. Let's hope there will be some changes in season 2 but i have a lot of doubts...its so easy to copycat.......,6
WOW! This was amazing! It takes every single 80's movie you've ever seen and smashes it together. I watched this show in less then 1 week and I loved it! 3 out of 5 people in my family are watching it or have already watched it. I would say this is certainly the best show I have ever watched besides Buffy the Vampire Slayer and maybe Sherlock. Each episode just gets better and better. I cannot wait for season 2. The characters are just great! and I love how many genres this show has. Get Netflix and watch this show NOW! I have so many good things to say about this show. I will never forget how good this show is! The acting's great! The theme song is great! Watch this right NOW!,10
"First off, I'm not an Eighties movies fan, not in the sense that I don't like those movies, but more of that I haven't really watched that many of them, at least not the ones that Stranger Things supposedly pays homage to.That being said, what made me love this series clearly wasn't nostalgia. How do I put it into words? To understand, you'll probably have to watch it yourself to find out.The premise is simple enough. A boy disappears, and his friends try to find him. Along the way, they become entangled in strange supernatural incidents, that is the monsters/conspiracy theory kind. It starts with a slow but sure pace, gradually turning on the suspense, with revelation after another coming as the plot thickens and develops superbly.There's solid acting from the cast: the kids, Winona Ryder and David Harbour; some people complain about Winona Ryder's overacting, but how else would you expect a mother whose child disappears to be like? The kids are also instantly likable and convincing, with a refreshing spirit that shines through.The story develops very well, but it isn't of the countless convoluted plot twists kind: simple enough, but pulls you in anyhow. It draws inspiration from the 80's sci-fi/horror genre, but it's not frightening or scary, instead, what stands out, at least for me, is the underlying mood. Sure, their friend has disappeared, but they always have the admirable childlike hope and enthusiasm; there isn't any sense of despair among them. Even their love of science, especially with their science teacher, is infectious. Nostalgia certainly didn't get me, but perhaps what did is the amalgam of sci-fi, fantasy, science, mystery and suspense that is this show.So thank you Netflix for making this show happen. I mean, House Of Cards was great(I binged-watched it too), but Stranger Things was something else altogether. For a moment(a very long one), it made me feel like I was back reading LOTR again, wishing and trying so hard to believe in magic...trying to convince myself that it was all real.",10
"A story about childhood and kids. About friendship and love. In this respect, this movie harks back to a better tradition. Before the blood and gore video games of today.Strong performances by the adults. Amazing performances by the kids.On the negative side, plot is an amalgamation of Carrie, Firestarter and bump-in-the-night.Runs out of suspense about half way when it turns into an action movie. The ending felt a little unsatisfactory.Less melodrama and more perspective, please.Still, the actors carry the series most of the way. Hope that the second season has enough gas left in the tank.",7
"If you haven't watched Stranger things yet watch it now!Seriously do not read anything about. Just watch it by yourself. But be careful! Next 8 hours of your life will be filled by watching this show. But it's worth it! You'll find a lot of references to Spielberg's movies, works of Stephen King, Lynch.Everything is on the high level: the plot, the montage, the music, the acting (This is the best part!). Young actors literally stunned me, especially Millie Bobby Brown.If you feel nostalgia about 80's and your childhood, if you like adventures and mystery, if deep in your mind you are the same kid, you'll enjoy it.Do you really want to see the rate?11/10",10
"Wonderful homage to the films of the 70's and 80's. There is heavy leaning on John Carpenter, Steven Spielberg, Chris Columbus, Joe Dante, and Tobe Hooper among others. If you are of the correct generation, Boomer myself, you can watch for the numerous allusions; and applaud the set and costume designer for the collection of memorabilia you can spot. Pretty sure I saw an AMC Pacer and Gremlin on the streets.The story moves along at a brisk pace and each episode ends with a cliff-hanger that just about demands you stay and binge watch the entire series: thankfully there were only eight episodes because my wife and I were up until one a.m. finishing off series one.Both of us were impressed with the acting of the young ""Goonies""; and we argued over who David Harbour reminded us of: I am holding to my opinion of Jack Nicholson. And Winona Ryder just disappeared into Joyce Byers.Overall, a fun roller coaster that comes to a satisfactory stop, and the promise of a bigger and faster ride coming for those of us in the queue.",10
"For starters, guys who glorify this series shall use the money they've received for it to buy some taste, knowledge and experience. This show is really nothing special. Some Super 8, some Star Wars, some Stephen King, some Goonies ... Nothing original and creative. Lacks humor. Winona Ryder is overacting. Kids are OK but aren't they in any show? David Harbour is OK - seems to me he was the only one to find measure in dosing his efforts. Credits shall also got to Billie Bobby Brown. The show is too slow and basically nothing really happens until the last episode, when again nothing significant happens. Everything seems like: ""Guys, write something in a way that it ends or not in the first season, depending on advertisers and money income."" Everything in this show is black & white. Good guys are good, bad are bad (as in Government), naive and stupid are naive and stupid and so on. Too many clichés. Childish at best.Not worth watching and certainly not worth another season. Forget this ever happened and I'll try to forgive the Duffer brothers. Do we have a deal?",3
"Stranger Things is written & directed by The Duffer Brothers and stars Winona Ryder, David Harbour, Finn Wolfhard, Millie Bobby Brown, Gaten Matarazzo, Caleb McLaughlin, Natalia Dyer, Charlie Heaton, Noah Schnapp and Cara Buono.When a young boy disappears, his mother, a police chief, and his friends must confront terrifying forces in order to get him back.Where to begin? Stranger Things is one of the most enjoyable pieces of television that I've experienced in years. With a satisfying eight episodes in its first season, The Duffer Brothers have delivered a multi- genre masterpiece that has taken the world by storm.The writing throughout is smart and compelling, lending every actor/actress a real chance to delve into their respective characters and they all do so with impeccable skill. It's extremely difficult to pick out the highlighting performances when every single one of them were outstanding. But, I must mention the following names in appreciation of their talent. Millie Bobby Brown is seriously convincing in her portrayal of the mysterious Eleven (or 'Elle'), and although only twelve years old, she gives one of the most incredibly diverse and grown-up performances I've ever seen. Winona Ryder plays a distraught Joyce, mother of Will, who goes through many stages of emotional despair, breaking down and falling apart as she searches for her son, in an impressive and relatable act. Charlie Heaton follows Ryder in this path but takes a slightly different direction as he becomes one of the many powerful leads in the series, within a couple episodes. Heaton has undeniable chemistry with co-star Natalia Dyer (playing Nancy) and they both share some interesting moments together, most notably, in the final three episodes. David Harbour plays police chief, Jim Hopper, and progressively propels into his character as he digs deeper into the strange 'missing boy' case. Last but certainly not least, the Kids (Finn Wolfhard, Gaten Matarazzo & Caleb McLaughlin) are enthralling, fascinating and hugely entertaining as they search for their friend, Will (Noah Schnapp), and ultimately take the screen with surprisingly genuine, adult performances. Highlighting Matarazzo (Dustin) and Wolfhard (Mike) as my consistent favourites during my experience with the show.Kyle Dixon & Michael Stein are in control of the score, taking huge inspiration from the 1980s, using synthesisers to construct an incredible ensemble soundtrack that in some way feels like its own character. Along with the show taking critical acclaim, the soundtrack manages to find an audience, be it fans of the show, composers, directors, producers, it seems everyone wants this sound in their work. Dixon & Stein have crafted and presented a stunning score, from the opening theme to the closing credits.Something the show creators, set decorators, designers and costume departments have worked hard on is featuring many references paying homage to classic 70s/80s movies, and while it's packed with them, the writers strive in staying original in the storytelling. The plot is seemingly simple, yet once you begin watching you notice how complex it really is. Every episode is filled with mystery and tension. Even when you think the story is heading somewhere predictable, it alters drastically and heads off in another direction. I strongly believe that this is greatly due to its short run of eight episodes. There's no 'filler' episode in this show. It's an entirely fast-paced, energetic and powerful running length which will have you binge watching until you've seen it all. Lucky for us, a second season has been confirmed by Netflix, with a further nine episodes coming in 2017.Verdict; There's simply nothing quite like Stranger Things. It's enthralling, engaging, emotional, heartfelt, funny, smart, complex and certainly entertains the viewer. Did I mention it also has a killer soundtrack? You're right, I did. - Stranger Things is now streaming on Netflix.Stranger Things: Season One, 10/10.",9
"I gave 8 because ,i really loved the plot and it made a grasp to my interest that made me expect what will happen next. I would have given 10 , if most background sounds are less audible than the interacting voices.In most places i had to use subtitles to know what they are speaking about because of those background sound.I really liked that young lady who played the ""Eleven"" character, she is beautiful and cute.I hope you would bring her for the next season, i forgot to mention those 4 friends,They kinda interesting,funny in most parts. And i should really say , i am definitely expecting your next season , better make it soon.Best regards ,",8
"""Stranger things"" is essentially ""Goonies"" meets ""Alien"". A fine blend of adventure and horror, with an 80s retro vibe that immerses you in a completely believable world. It undoubtedly engrosses anyone who sits down to watch. The direction is excellent and the performances, especially the ones from the young cast, will surprise you.As everyone will tell you, there is a cast of extremely talented young boys at the center of the plot, but Millie Bobby Brown as ""Eleven"" is a revelation - a young Sigourney Weaver that fights an equally terrifying ""Alien"". Millie has everyone out there ranting and raving about her, and deservedly so. It seems ""Stranger Things"" is going to be remembered in the future as the pedestal for the launching of her career as a major star. Millie approaches a very difficult and demanding role, that's stripped down verbally and has to be essentially performed using body language, with the maturity of a much older actress.The only problem with ""Stranger Things"", honestly, is, how the next season or seasons will be able to live up to the audience's elevated expectations! ""Stranger Things"" has set the bar very high for its own good. Here is to hoping the Duffer Brothers know what they are doing and they will not disappoint!",9
"If you somehow think ""Back to the Future"" movies and series represents the height of storytelling and think American horror flics from the eighties are ""cool"" then this will be entertaining. Maybe you will feel that way if you were born in the eighties like the Duffer brothers.On the other hand, if you put any demands on TV-shows also of this type, then you're wasting your time. I just wasted it for nine episodes in the hope of some nice twists. What utter boring old crap this series is made of. The logical wasteland that is the story and the one-dimensional storytelling and acting will bore you. You could put a supertanker in the plot holes which is exasperating considering the high quality of TV-scripts these days. This kind of thing only could fly in the eighties and while Stranger Things is grounded in the eighties, it's not a very entertaining aspect to adopt also the stupid antics from that era. Stranger Things could have been great, but it's so small minded it's downright painful.The acting overall is barely acceptable. Not the worst I've seen and most actors do what they can with this weak material I guess.Winona makes a somewhat convincing mother and David Harbour has presence most of the time. The boys Finn, Caleb and Gaten, well I guess they're doing OK. The only one that stands out though is Millie Bobby Brown that manages to have charisma and mystique just by being there on screen. She's hardly worth going trough all the episodes for, but her performance should be noted. She can't save the story though. Waste your time on this at your own peril and make sure to check your brain at the door!",3
"This TV show is about as nice to watch as a Disney movie. It's certainly entertaining in its own manner. However if it was not for some effects that are typical for Horror movies like ""Poltergeist"" and many others I would say it is more appropriate for Children than for adults.Some boys around the age of 12 are fighting bad guys and a monster from a parallel world who is responsible for the disappearance of their friend who now is not available to play board games anymore. They have a girl with Superpowers helping them. The bad guys are trying to find the girl with the Superpower so the boys help her to hide.The boy who has disappeared also has his mother trying to find him. In this she is being supported by the Police Chief.Then there is a side plot with some adolescents behaving like - well, adolescents, or better like adolescents in American movies for adolescents. One is the guy all girls are after, the other one is the outsider the girl falls in love with. Of course the adolescents - or at least some of them - are involved in fighting the evil monster. However the adolescents still find enough time to party and to drink beer, but sometimes they happen to be kidnapped by the monster.All of this is funny and nice to watch, but after all that hype I would have certainly expected much more than a mixture between ""Poltergeist"" and The Famous Five.",6
As i watched stranger things i would say this series was excellent and had very good suspenseful Moments. While watching the show i noticed that every time Will tried to contact his mother or either his friends it was done using electricity. Electricity played a big role in this cause in the series Will was basically trapped in an underworld that was considered different from our world everything was much more darker compared. They also made friends with with a girl named Eleven whose named was shortened to El. In the show she was a test subject in a psychiatric ward by her farther. She met Mike they started too fall for each other but she also ended up helping him and his friends get back into contact with will.In one part of the show it shows the viewer how these people are brought into the underworld it is also well enough explained how one must get there by creating just enough electricity that nobody not even humans could possibly make.Believe it or not this all started over a game involving a demogorgon .Overall i feel like this series is good for any mystery and suspense class its fun and addictive.,10
As i watched stranger things i would say this series was excellent and had very good suspenseful Moments. While watching the show i noticed that a lot of energy and electricity was involved with making contacting to friends and family. Energy was used throughout the show because their a girl named eleven that you would eventually meet and she can moving things and use radios. Their a certain part in the show where elevens father tried to make her kill a cat using her energy but she couldn't . Since she couldn't do it her father had her taking away and she ended up hurting the guards.In one part of the show it shows the viewer how these people are brought into the underworld it is also well enough explained how one must get there by creating just enough electricity that nobody not even humans could possibly make. Nancy's friend barb ended up getting dragged there from steves pool and the demogorgon ended up killing her. At the end El used her energy to kill this demogorgon so that everyone else could live. This was a great show and something that i would watch a season 2 of,9
As the show continues to throw unexpected twists and turns i find myself stuck on one thing trying to figure out what happened. There a lot of electric moments where there's lights flickering and beams of lights in the dark. There is a whole other world where if blood is in the real world then this monster comes out and begins attacking.Then the girl that looks like a boy is getting hunted down by her father because he know that she has super powers.The biggest part of the story line is to figure out where will is. Will is in another word and he can communicate in lights and other ways. There is a moment in the show where some people say it was will that got pulled out of the water but his friends knew that it wasn't him.,4
"Strangers Things is overall a good show, consisting of horror, adventure, and suspense. The cast was absolutely amazing considering how young they were. The show focuses a lot on energy and the power it has in the town of Hawkins. Every time the monster is near it always mess with the electricity around it, for example turning off lights and messing with telephones. Will use the power of energy from the underworld to communicate with his mom, to let her know where he is and to tell her he was alive. She then started buy a lot of Christmas lights and putting them around her house so she can communicate with her son. While this was happening everyone around her started thinking she was insane. When they found wills body, the light didn't stop communicating with Joyce(wills mom) which made her think will was still alive. It turns out the body was fake because the scientist/government have planted it on purpose to attract the attention off of themselves. Hopper(Sheriff) realize that they were the ones who took will or knew something about his disappearance. It turns out everything from will disappearance, the monsters, El (eleven) was all connected to them. The kids Dustin, Eleven, Mike, and Lucas went on their own mission to find will with the help of eleven powers. While looking for will the government was chasing them to get eleven back. The whole show is basically base on the power of energy and science of experimentation. Everyone who's about to be taken all the power around them goes off and when they turn back on, their gone. Although my review is an 9/10 i was still say is a show you want to watch. It could've easily been a solid 10/10 if the show haven't been so predictable and consist of many more horrifying events. Overall i recommend it to everyone, very entertaining and you will feel a since of connections to the characters.",9
"stranger things has a lot of electricity and energy moments.most moments are usually when the demogorgon is in the scene or they sense it. for example the scene when he took will he used the shed lights and the phone to scare him. in another scene where that was used was when will was trying to connect with his mother and he communicated with her with lights. there are also suspenseful moment like when eleven goes into the pool to go and find barb, also when barb and will disappeared. i feel that this show gave us many high hopes for the next season. also i like that the show didn't give many hints so it would always keep up guessing. this show is very interesting its has many unexpected moments and i cant wait for season two to come out",10
"The show Stranger Things has many, many electric and suspenseful moments. Some of the moments when the electricity starts going crazy is when the demogorgon comes around. Also, the demogorgon comes around when it's triggered blood. For example when Eleven killed her Papa and his workers, there was a lot of blood so it triggered the demogorgon. Another example when the electricity was going crazy was when Will was communicating with his mother through the lights in his house. Some energy moments that happened in this show was when Barb was sitting at the pool alone waiting for Nancy. Barb was bleeding so that triggered the demogorgon. We didn't know what happened to Barb. Was she alive? or was she dead? Another suspenseful moment was when Will fell off his bike and ran into his shed, and the lights flickered and then he disappeared. Was he okay? Who or What took him?",10
"Stranger Things had a lot of suspenseful moments and overall the show in my opinion is excellent and has a lot of electricity and energy movements throughout the show. The most was when the electricity and energy movement occurred was when the Demogorgon appeared or when will was trying to communicate to someone. For example, when Will's mom was trying to communicate with him she used lights and wrote the ABCs on the wall and had him use that to communicate with her. The most suspenseful moments in the show would have to be when Eleven was basically put into the pool of water and she had to use her ""powers"" to communicate or try and find Barbs and Will. When she went we got to see the view of how the Underground world looks like and how things are. Another scene would have to be when El went to go defeat the Demon and her last word were "" i'm sorry mike"". She defeated the Demon to save everyone's life. The show is very very good and I would definitely recommend it to others. The show leaves us wanting to continue more and more after each episode and I literally cannot wait for Season 2!!!!!!!",10
"When the monster first appears to kidnap Will, the light bulb in the shed becomes really bright and Will disappears.Also when we first see Hawking lab, we see lights flashing in the hallway when the doctor walks through the hallway.We see Eleven using her power when she stops the fan at Benny restaurant.When the cops go to the shed where Will disappeared, one of the cops turns on the light but the power goes off. After he does that, the light starts to flicker.When the people from the lab go to Benny's, Eleven kills two of the agents by using her telekinesis.Will's mother gets a weird phone call. When the call ends, she gets shocked by electricity.When one of the kids decides to tell the adults about Eleven, she closes the door with her mind.When Will's mom gets a second call, the lights flash and the phone gets electrified and becomes black.After the phone call, music starts playing by itself lights become bright then electricity goes off and the monster appears in Will's house.When Barbara is at the party, her hand is bleeding and some blood drips into the pool and that makes the monster appear in the pool. When the monster comes, all of the lights go off in the pool and then Barbara is in the upside-down.Will mother uses lights to communicate with Will. When he is in the upside down, Eleven uses her power to make things fly.When Mike's mom visits Will's mom, she takes her daughter with her and when Michael sister walks around the house the lights flash next to her and the monster almost gets her.Eleven gets a flashback in which she is using her power to kill guards. After she kills them, she bleeds from her nose.Will's mom uses the Christmas lights to put a alphabet on her wall so she could later use it to communicate.Eleven uses her power so Will could communicate through the talkie.When the kids are at the speech for Will, bullies are making fun of Will. Eleven uses her power to freeze one of the bullies and makes him pee himself.Eleven gets a flashback in which she is using her power to hear things in the other room and when she does that the power goes off. Kids use the machine and Eleven's power at the school to communicate with Will. When they start communicating, Will's mom hears him on the radio and he appears in the wall of her house.After the conversation ends, the machine catches on fire and Eleven bleeds.Eleven gets another flashback in which she is put inside of the salt water so she could enter the upside down.Eleven throws Lucas when they start arguing.Eleven uses her power to increase the distance so that the talkie could be used.They fill a pool with water and salt so Eleven could use generate more power and enter the upside down.Nancy and Will's brother are at Will's house because they want to kill the monster. When the monster comes, the lights flash.Lab people arrive at the school to get Eleven but Eleven kills most of them by the use of her power. She collapses after that.The lights flash and the monster appears and attacks everyone. Eleven kills the monster by the use of her power and she disappears.I really enjoyed the show and I can't wait for the next season.",8
"Stranger things has a bunch of interesting moments that are filled with electrical events such as when Joyce tried to communicate with Will in her house and all the Christmas lights flickered, or when she answered the phone and it electrocuted her and broke. Also in the shed when the light bulb flickered during the search. There were many suspenseful moments. One suspenseful moment was when the demogorgon appeared in the house when Nancy and Jonathan were alone. Also when Joyce was in the room trying to communicate with Will and the paint was showing up in order of words. When they found the body in The woods and they thought it was wills. Another exciting/ suspenseful moment was when 11 was in the water tank and she had the dream and the whole building went falling.",9
"9? This is what happens when a culture of hype, trend and Netflix zombies rate things. Ratings no longer signify a good movie or show. They just shows what's trending. How did this crap ever get made? Did someone notice a bunch of online teens saying that they're 80s or that they wish they were 80s and Netflix decided to make a show on a Web trend? This whole show is just a spot the 80s game and it's boring after the first movie poster. It's inferior to every movie it takes from. The episodes and show itself don't stand apart or have an individual strength. At heart its more 90s then 80s with the boring Dawson's Creek type love story. But Netflix are catering for the teen girl binge viewer. The characters are awful and interact on only simple terms. Like the kids always bicker because that's what kids do. They go on adventures on crap bikes because the Goonie did therefore all kids in the 80s.The grieving mom is crazy but in the end right because that's what happens to characters in generic shows. The cool outsider listens to The Smiths even though they're not even out yet (year out.) I wonder if he'll get the girl??? That would be a surprise. The cop is disillusioned and then by the most basic character development he eventually won't be. Every plot in this show as well as the dialogue is predictable. The show obviously has plans to run a long time because it's so stretched out and slow. Nothing happens and then at the end something will to fool you into watching the next one. Watched by people who want to be part of a trend. Did I mention it's 80s? Well that makes it good. Most people watching this weren't even born in the 80s yet seem to judge it's authenticity. Horror? What horror? And that character 11 or whatever her name is. She just plays the generic alien learning human ways. E.g Ways? What's. ..ways? Love? What's. ...love? Christ almighty this show is trash.",1
"Stranger Things is highly overrated because it's boring,childish,empty and with a story already seen many times and full of clichés.The acting and directing is OK but predictable, being the Sheriff and Winona Ryder the best in my opinion, the visuals are good recreating the 80's and the special effects in the same level.About the 80's..it's not the 80's if the characters spend too much time making references to it.. (Lando....Lando...Lando...shut up..cliché fat-hat-kid with funny speaking.So,after the movie Super 8 making fun of the 80's (i kind of like the movie even if the name JJ_destroyer_of_Star_Wars_Abrams was there.)we have a 80's based show. The 80's are the new 2010's. Well,i love the 80's i was a kid full of dreams about the excellent movies and shows they created but when recreate them today, don't forget to make them unforgettable and full of magic but at the same time simple and full of heart as they were.And...PLEASE, somebody give Eggos to Nancy....",6
"Perhaps my very low expectations are the reason I found this surprisingly good. It could have been a dreadful CGI-fest, but until the last episode the slick effects are kept to a minimum, and a lot is left to the imagination, which in my opinion makes for a more compelling experience. The acting is solid, and particularly the kids, which can make or break something like this, are not annoying, rather being well-cast and hitting the right balance. The plot is credible to an extent, but completely falls apart in the denouement, with manifold gaping holes in the last two episodes. However, how much plausibility can you really ask for in a show about monsters, telekinesis and ""the other side""? Considering this, I think it holds up quite well. All in all, this is a love letter to horror classics, and while references do not automatically equal quality, it has enough to please the buffs and those who simply want to watch something engaging and thrilling. A small gripe regarding references is that, for example, a scene almost completely ripped from Aliens which occurs in the last episode brought me out of the story and made me start thinking about Aliens, and the fact that Ryder had been in Alien 4, which is all rather distracting.",7
"I am a 90s baby so I had yet to discover Winona Ryder and her awesomeness. Recently I watched a movie called Honeybee that I loved and it was inspired by Heathers which I then watched and I became obsessed! I started watching this show just for Winona Ryder and I loved her in it! I ended up loving everyone in this however, and I felt like I was watching the baby of ET and Heathers put together. The whole cast is so amazing and I can't get enough of the friendships with the kids. I can't say much more without including spoilers but I have a lot of hope for how they ended it, maybe its not quite so dark after all? I don't know but I do know I love Winona Ryder and discovering her and glad she made a comeback and I can't wait to watch the next season.",10
"I heard about this series and really was looking forward to seeing it, but I was very disappointed.First of all, there's no way it gets as high a rating as it has without every Netflix employee going on and giving it a ten.IMDb is great, but it can't stop the fraud going on here.But back to the series. I watched all 8 episodes, hoping it would get better, but it only go worse.Now I know why Winona Ryder hasn't had many offers lately. She's a terrible actress. The whole time she has this facial expression like she's a deer in the headlights. It's very annoying to watch her pretend to be obsessed with finding her son.Actually, none of the characters were properly developed. None are likable, except maybe the sheriff.And as several others noted, this is a ripoff of every horror, scifi story ever written.Can't anyone come up with something original and well written?",1
"Words can't describe how much I love this show. The characters experience tremendous growth throughout the series, and all of them are lovable in their own ways. I am anxiously awaiting the next season. This is by FAR Netflix's best series. It's a spectacular 80's-style series, and is captured just beautifully. Dustin, aka ""Toothless,"" Mike, and Eleven are definitely my favorite characters, although all of them are cool in their own ways. For whatever reason, this series is able to capture the 80's, ""kids on bikes"" vibe without any corniness at all. I am absolutely captivated by this show... I finished it in a matter of days! The next season can't come soon enough!!!!!!!!!",10
"/refers to Season 1/In general, I am not into supernatural force dramas, particularly when the ""monsters"" are unaware of their wickedness, but after reading praising views and emanating from limited number (8) of episodes, I decided to give it a try... And became gradually contented.Well, the beginning was slow and the child characters reminded me the ones in e.g. Stand By Me, but the distinctive performance of Winona Ryder and the hints that ""earthly"" forces are also ""guilty"" made me to appreciate several nuances and scenes. Although being definitely the most famous performer, Mrs. Ryder did not steal the show, but was at best excelling herself as a fine team player. Most of the youth were bright-line as well and evidently not picked from model agencies based on ""cute"" looks.Besides, the series includes a good cinematography and creation of suitable atmosphere, with the events dating back to the 1980ies, to the days I was young myself, with all that music and outfit...Despite the pacing was uneven at times, and some scenes were protracted or did not provide additional value to the series, I would like to watch Season 2 when revealed. Some final scenes from Episode 8 excited my interest and let me ponder on and over how the next season could evolve - as many questions found their answer and events did find their closure.PS In fact, I liked Season 2 a bit more - due to enchanced sci-fi action.",8
"It is great, but still a bit overrated. I think its rating is based less on its quality and more on nostalgia for the '80s that it brings. It pulls many elements from legendary shows and movies from the '80s and it's an obvious homage to Stephen King and movies like ""E.T."", ""It"", ""Golden Child"", ""Lost Boys"", etc. I'm not thrilled, but I am very satisfied. I enjoyed it and I'm very eager for the next season.8/10",8
"Stranger Things was an absolute blast to watch. As we have come to expect from Netflix, the production side of things was spotless. The show is visually stunning, the score is compelling, and the performances are excellent across the board. However, the writing does suffer from an over-abundance of cliché. Of course, Stranger Things is, at its core, a callback to the classic monster movies of the 80s meaning that much of this cliché is not only forgivable, but even adds to the overall atmosphere of the show.My main problem with this is that the characters were only barely interesting enough to keep me invested in their stories. Again, much of this was intentional, but I feel that it was a bit overdone on the character side of things. We have all seen the alcoholic, loner, cop with a tragic past, the attractive, straight-laced young girl that yearns to break out of her shell despite the protestations of her more sensible friend, and the frustrated kid that sees what is going on, but is ignored by the adults so he takes things into his own hands. With all the other clichés - those of plot, visuals, and music - Netflix used them, but added a layer of production value that elevated them to the next level. However, with character, they are more-or-less tired old reruns of characters we have all seen a thousand times.That being said, Stranger Things is definitely worth the watch. For the most part, it rides the line between familiarity and mystery, and, for all my griping about the characters, I did care enough that I never lost interest in their fates. Were they complex and compelling? No. However, they were good enough. Besides, Stranger Things' calling card is not the writing or the characters. It is not a moving drama or a character study, it is a nostalgic revitalization of an out-dated genre. On this front, the show succeeds admirably. It will not challenge you, nor will it leave you with any lingering emotion, but it does provide 8 hours of some of the most beautiful, thrilling, and binge-able television in recent memory.",8
"Stranger Things is really good. Every time I had watched an episode then I immediately wanted to watch the next episode. You get this feeling where you just needs to know what have happened.The actors really did a great job, and especially the children, you could really feel the mood they were in. When they were happy you were and when they were sad you were sad.I am giving it 9 out of 10 stars because i really enjoyed it but i am not giving it 10 stars because I thought there were some parts i really did not understand. It is not because it think it was some bad parts, but I just did not understand them.I can't wait to see how season two is going to be.",9
"I cannot express how dam good this show is so I'm going to be very informal.At the beginning of the summer this year, my Facebook updates were jammed with constant articles and posts about the mysterious new show Stranger Things on Netflix. I at that point had not much interest, and now I want to beat myself up for that. Then just last Thursday I started o episode 1 of this so called ""Stranger Things"" and immediately as soon as it finished I was having leg cramps of excitement (seriously I did get leg cramps).Stranger Things follows the community of the town of Hawkins, who come together when a young boy Will Byers sinisterly disappears. While the local police carry out their investigation, paranormal and supernatural occurrences begin to haunt the town. We follow the adventures of: the three best fiends of the missing boy as they try to look for their lost pal, the brilliant performed hysterical mother by Winona Ryder, the curious girl who more than meets the eye, and the typical high school sub storyline, which is interesting than first considered.Created by the Duffer Brothers Stranger Things pulls together all 80s nostalgia and classic cinematic adventures such as Goonies, ET, Steven Spielberg, and Stephen King. You fell very familiar with what you see, but by the end you will be so mind blown from what you just witnessed. A very easy to watch show consisting of 8 episodes of 50 minutes, makes Stranger Things the most binge watchable show ever. Just an afternoon's work.The show is very creepy mostly ( the score is out of the is world literally), but has its sweet, funny moments as well, so has something for everyone. It has sub genre as a horror but not conventional sense.This is seriously a show worth watching, even if this is the one show you watch its definitely worth paying for. Stranger Things is a fantastic, traditional and original piece of perfect television ( the best out of the whole year I'd say). A must watch 10/10 OBVIOUSLY!",10
"What's inside of a secret government lab located in Hawkins, Indiana may hold something far beyond comprehension. Consisting of a portal to a parallel world and a carnivorous demogorgon prowling for the next victim. ""Stranger things""-a sci-fi thriller, is about a young boy named Will that goes missing one night, and the courageous and adrenaline filled acts that are done to find him. The lead cast is fabulous and plays their part perfectly. I've personally never been a fan of sci-fi shows or movies, but ""stranger things"" has me hooked The idea of multiple dimensions and aliens has always intrigued me. Some people think the show is ""too slow."" The fact the writers could put a whole story consisting of as many things as it does, into an 8 episode season is really impressive and proves each and every episode is packed to a max with content you're looking for. The second complaint was ""the aliens and super human abilities are too much."" If you like sci-fi alien movies/miniseries that are: super good,suspenseful, and keeps you on your toes, then this is the one for you.",10
"I got into this without knowing much about the story but only a sci-fi series. As step by step, you can enjoy the story in a mild pace, not fast and not too slow. The first two o three episodes create a tense atmosphere but as more things are revealed, puzzles are putting together. What surprised me was the performance by the main characters. The arguments among kids, the ignorance, ego, imagination and intelligent define what a pure friendship and brotherhood at the early age. As well as a more complicate teenage period by other main characters. Although I don't remember exactly how I would think in those years but I enjoyed the lines. However, like other drama, there are still some main things are not explained or fully explained. At this point, there are not enough clues for speculations. It would be interested to see how the story would continue. And hope that in the future, the story would not turn into another soap drama for teenagers' love story.",8
"Where to begin.. I am usually not a big fan of sci-fi, fantasy or the period of time where this show takes place, but Jesus Crist was I pleasantly surprised! I was literally hooked after 10 minutes of this show and watched it all in one sitting. I wont go in to any plot details since I don't wanna risk spoiling even the smallest thing. But what I will do is say that I think this show is close to perfect in just about every way. It's a great and intriguing story, the tempo is perfect, the scenery is fantastic and the characters and acting is easily up there with the best I have ever seen in a movie or series combined. All the characters contribute to the story and I care about every single one of them. The writing is great as well.. It feels like every line and conversation moves the story forward in a well planned way which in my opinion is rare.There is definitely something for everyone in this show.. The mixture of sci-fi, horror, comedy and drama is really quite unique and I would think that it speaks just as well to a 15 year old girl as it did to me a 30 year old man.To sum this up I must give huge props to Netflix. You guys are simply awesome and you really struck gold with this show. I truly hope that season 2 will be just as impressive as the first one.. I will be patiently waiting and watching every other Netflix original in search for the next masterpiece in the meantime.",9
"I RARELY post any kind of reviews for TV shows or movies, and to be honest, most of the time I start watching a new show, I am disappointed. However, after watching the first season of ""Stranger Things"" I am more impressed with this show than I have been with any other for a very long time. The acting is believable, the music is, well, perfect, and the plot is very engaging. And on top of that, there was no nudity and the language is for the most part clean, which I personally appreciate. And of course, being a child of the 80's (and this show being set in that era), the creators/directors really do nail it in regards to that. Can't wait for season 2 ... c'mon, hurry up July 2017!",10
"From my output on TV series has always remained low because I do not watch TV series ever,but this was a Netflix series,so that's different,because they have all the episodes provided all in order. Anyway,I started watching the first episode and I was getting really interested,and I was like screw it,right? I'm going to watch the entire season(but that was also because I had nothing to watch). While I was watching it,it was like in the middle of the night,I was still wide awake,but usually when I stay awake during stuff I like,it just means I'm into it. I got through the entire season,I was impressed plus heart warmed too. I was actually not expecting a lot from this series. It most of all impressed me by how science fiction and scary it was,that was another reason why I watched it. But what also got me interested was that they added connections in the series to make it also a type of emotional series as well. When I watched this series,I was just expecting a lot from what I don't really care about series,which is long time get to the point type of stuff. Stranger things is a type of series that doesn't mess around,they get to the point and they just basically have everything I wasn't actually expecting out of this,and what I didn't expect is what I was impressed by. And that's what I loved about this series. It was scary,science fiction,and sad too.When I got done with the series,I just said can't wait for season 2,and I said it with a lot of meaning too. I really can't wait to see what happens next. In the mean time,I just continue to watch season 1 to keep me busy.",10
"""Stranger Things"" is a very big surprise. After all, it's a made for Netflix series, so it's going to be cheap and suck...right?! Well, no...fortunately. Despite having mostly no-name actors and a modest budget, this show turned out to be a hit and one that promises to bring us more episodes. At the time I am writing this, the eighth episode has been aired and the series appears over...or so you think until the very end.So what is this show? Well, in many ways it's like some Steven King novels (particularly ""Firestarter""), the 1980s and ""Gravity Falls"" all mashed up into one really strange but fascinating show.The show begins with a child being lost into another dimension and his mother is naturally out of her mind with worry. But soon this sense of panic is felt by many in this small community. In the midst of this, a young girl, who is simply named '11' arrives in the town and is hidden by some middle school boys. They know she's being hunted...but what does she have to do with the disappearance as well as folks seeing monsters?! Well, watch this paranoid show and you'll see.So why was the show so effective and why are so many folks eagerly awaiting more episodes? Well, the writing is terrific and the direction really keeps you on the edge of your seats. The acting is also surprisingly good and overall the package is well worth seeing and will impress you. Far better than network television.",10
"I'm not really into horror and I postponed watching this when I learned that it was set in the 80's, as I like modern series and films. But this is more mystery/thriller than scary and the whole 80s scene actually worked in its favour.I don't want to give anything away, as I believe that the less you know about a TV show or movie, especially a thriller, the more you'll enjoy it. I'll just add that there are children, teenagers, adults (thankfully) and their paths all interconnect to create a gripping story, with a mix of drama, suspense and even some humour. I was quite surprised to see that many episodes were written by different people, as they all pick up where the previous one left off. This is one series that it's easy to binge watch, I couldn't wait to see what would come next.Of course this isn't for everyone. It's sort of sci-fi but there is more fiction than science. But if it's entertainment you're after, this delivers.2022 June Update: I changed my rating from 9 to 7 after watching season four (until episode 7). I still think it's very good, but it feels like an introduction dragged over seven episodes and my favourite character didn't take a prominent role. Perhaps it's my taste that changed, or the pace has become a little too slow, making me wait too long for an interesting or good development.",7
"SPOILERS AHEAD...I decided on watching this after my typical preview of the boring blah blah on Netflix. Netflix watchers rated it pretty high and I enjoy this creepy, weird genre.Decided to stream it via my BluRay box but the TV's cinema settings were a bit wonky so I watched S1 on my PC.Watching the pilot and the subsequent episode I recognized 2 names from previous movies; Winona Ryder and Matthew Modine. The rest of the cast were a bunch of newbies.The feel I got was 'what the hell am I watching? Stephen King? John Carpenter? Steven Spielberg? After S1E2 I started getting this bad headache. The splish-splosh of themes and mish mosh of various movie directions started to ring in my mind like a great bell.This bell rang until the very end. So what was Stranger Things? A huge extrapolation of various works by various directors and mushed into this TV series called ""Stranger Things"" - Aliens meets Hemlock Grove meets E.T. is this Stranger Things.Since there was nothing else on Netflix, I watched all of Season 1 in one sitting. Just to be objective. It really was meh.No wonder this is just on Netflix, it would never survive on its own.",5
"When you're searching recommended movies and shows on your Netflix account, you'll find Stranger Things filed under the 'Sit Down and Binge-Watch This' category. Though in terms of genre, you can't put just one tag on it. Drawing inspiration from classics like The Goonies, The Breakfast Club, The X-Files and The Thing, the eight, hour-long episodes mix ingredients like the 80's high school coming-of-age, to the young, meddling kids adventure, to the supernatural lurking around every corner. Though what makes it stand out from any other time-period homage is incorporating several 80's flavors into one detail-driven thrill ride, making sure that certain qualities don't get overpowered from others (and we'll try to keep the spoilers back — you're gonna have to taste it for yourself).While the series' main drive is on the disappearance of twelve-year-old Will Byers, the story divides into several subplots in attempts to find him — and in doing so adds focus to the characters in their search. We see his closest friends: Mike, Dustin and Lucas joined by Eleven, a young, mysterious girl with a hidden past, Will's mom Joyce teamed with Chief of Police Hopper and the older siblings of Mike and Will, Nancy and Jonathan. Each story line peers into the lives both past and present, on relationships, grieving, love and betrayal. Each event experienced presently or in backstory ultimately plays a role how everyone got to where they are now, and all come together in the final climatic episodes.The fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana and the day-to-day living is another key ingredient in how the show plays out. While most of the residents live in the ordinary bubble of Hawkins, the main set of characters experience the supernatural occurrences that have recently (and relatively silently) plagued the town, brought on by unnatural experiments from Hawkins Laboratory, just outside of town. This tone-shift in the story is well-thought-out and unlike some of the shows and films that came before it, it doesn't fall back on every-other minute scares and doesn't get held back by relying on secondary scripting or unnecessary fluff. It's a natural, even fade in and out of light and dark, both in in dialogue and visual aspects.In past films and television set back in 1980's America, one can argue that their love for nostalgia in their movies that can overpower the viewer's palette. And if you still haven't logged in to Netflix to add it to your queue, you'll find Stranger Things holds nothing back when bringing up 80's culture — but doesn't make it obnoxious. Instead of completely dedicating the show to it, the show's design and look subtly flaunts culture unique to the day and time and occasionally dropping music and movie titles in the script, but all have their purpose and contribute to the making and telling of the story.When all of these aspects are rolled into one, 'Stranger Things' makes a nice, refreshing return to the past in more ways than one. The presence of classic, unforgettable 80's culture, the investment of young, raw talent along with some familiar faces from the era and the punctual, accurate telling of the story is an experience for whoever presses the play button. Each episode has an impact; people from every generation can have a genuine relation to what's playing out on the screen, where each flavor and taste comes in at the right moment, and doesn't settle for blandness.",9
"What a truly enthralling decade the 80's was. I'm truthfully not that into the zeitgeist, but man, was it a paramount era to the history of pop culture. And lately it has been resurrected into much of a contemporary subculture. From Sing Street to the upcoming Ready Player One motion picture, from MGMT to The 1975, mom jeans, hipster glasses—'nostalgia', so say them all, even though for the younger generation, it's mostly an all new trend made out of quirkier, stranger things (pun intended). And none of them fulfills me with the same surge of childish glee The Duffer Brothers' brain child imposes upon me.Stranger Things is a show that captivates my dissipating appetite for jaw- dropping fascinations and strange discoveries. It energizes me with zeals. It has me remember many mood-boosting things: John Hughes movies, Stand By Me (this one, very much), Star Wars (""Lando Calrissian!""), Star Trek (Ryder is Spock's abramsverse mom, c'mon), River Phoenix (Charlie Heaton, anyone?), ET, mutants and superheroes, familiar adorkable geekery and young love.From my inadequate description, you'd think it's a rainbows-and-unicorns kinda thing. It's not. It's a fairly dark sci-fi/thriller. But it's also a lot of pleasant things. A coming-of-age story, a love story, sometimes and more than you know, a comic entertainment. I think it was created with so much passion and enthusiasm that we all get to pass that on.From the flawless soundtrack to the Emmy-worthy production, direction, and performances, I'm all in. I've never seen an ensemble of more talented kids. Millie Bobby Brown gives me the Natalie Portman vibes, the whole package, down to her well-known intelligence. Finn Wolfhard, Gaten Matarazzo, Caleb McLaughlin, Noah Schnapp; I'm so in love with these kids that I sound like a pedophile.The Duffers have openly attributed their inspirations to their beloved 80's childhood. They paid homage to the likes of The Clash and Spielberg and Stephen King, and received one hell of endorsements in return. And I'm telling you, hop on and ride the hype. 9/10.",9
"like the younger generations are expecting a piece de la resistance. Spoiler...it's not, it's purposely flawed in just the right way. The fact you don't get that means this isn't something for you and that's OK. I lived through the 80s being a 40 something and this is spot on and is much better than those movies in writing, directing and acting. I view it as one of the best things to come out of Netflix another would be Sense 8. You cast your opinions, me I'm going to do the same and rave about this. In my eyes it is that good. My estimation based off some of these comments would hate on movies like Heathers, Weird Science, Aliens, Beetleguise and the like. Not their decade so they don't get it.",10
"Stranger things was the first TV show that I have ever watched entirely. It is a great TV show furthermore it is a good suspense to have fun. The story goes with some boys playing game for 10 hours, when Will, one of the boys, go back to his house, he weirdly disappeared. His friends looked for him, when suddenly they found a girl with super powers. She was created by an experience, her name is Eleven and she looked so scared because a bad man are wanting her to continue with the experience. She helped them to understand how to found Will, his mother and the chief of the city found Will in a place called the upside world. I just think the last chapter could be better, but in general it was good. I've watched other TV show like Strangers things, Supernatural but with one difference. Stranger things was fantasy story while supernatural was more realistic about spirits. I'm waiting so enthusiastically for the second season of Strangers things. I expect the monster is stronger and worse. During the show, Will's mother had been done the alphabet on the wall and put same lights to communicate with Will. I remember when I was a child I use to play with one, we wrote the alphabet in a paper, take a pen, do question so that the pen move from letter to letter forming words or sentences.",8
"The plot, the characters, the actors, the music... everything in this TV show is amazing. This is one of those series that you know will develop a sort of like cult following because of how well thought out it is and entertaining. I was so involved emotionally with the characters in a way that I have never been.This will be one of Netflix's most precious jewels. Strangers Things can be best described as fusion television at its best. You have intensive consuming drama, nail- biting thrills, terror and just the right touch of action for what decisively makes for a ten-star TV series.The talent of the writers is matched by the actors. Great job all around on the election process for this great team.",10
"""Borgen"" 8.5? ""The Fall"" 8.3 ""Citizen Kane"" 8.4???????????????????????????????????????????????????? ""Goodfellas"" 8.7 ""E.T."" 7.9the power of social networking....""Stranger Things"" is barely a 5.5...Ryder is in possibly the worst come back performance that I have ever seen.

"To start with, I would like to address another reviewer that speculated that all the rave reviews were written by articulate and insightful 12 & 13 year old's. He went on to say that no one over 14 would find Stranger Things intriguing enough to hold an adult's attention for more than 10 minutes. If that is the case, I am the world's oldest teenager. In the year this story takes place, I was 23 years old. So I will let you do the math.Of course, like so many who like to dis a show without watching the whole series, or even an entire episode, he wrote a review anyway. So I am compelled to ask, who really has the shorter attention span?I think the high IMDb rating is appropriate. After watching all 8 chapters of this story, that may yet to be over, I can say I was never bored. The acting was great and the Duffer Brother's took the time to build characters a viewer would care about. Eleven's ultimate fate seemed to be inevitable, but in science fiction, gone does not necessarily mean dead. She really was the hero of the story.My memories of 1983 are very clear, and the producers were very accurate on the dress, speech & music of the year. I so often see period pieces that use music or even fashion that would be off by a few years. So for myself, it was a nostalgic joyride.I only gave it 8 stars because the formula and plot are a patchwork of earlier shows & movies that I have seen over my many years watching Sci- Fi & horror. Having said that, I found it difficult to accurately predict what would happen next, so it kept me guessing and watching.I give Cu-do's to Netflix as I see original series that are far superior to any of the crap we get on regular TV these days. It is $12.00 a month that I never feel is a waste of money; and these days, that is a rare but wonderful thing.",8
"This is very good if you like sci-fi. Maybe more suited to older nerds than younger ones who may not get the references I love the 80's vibe. Great music from the era. I was that age in 1983, oh how times have changed but this series did take me back to better(?) more innocent times. It reminds me of stuff like ET, Goonies and Wargames. No spoiler here but at one point I almost hoped they would do a scene from ET but the they chose to do something like the opening sequence to one of the Austin Powers movies. And playing games like the Hobbit on my ZX Spectrum with friends plugged into a black and white TV I bought with paper round money. Episode 8 is 10 out of 10. If you haven't seen it watch it during the Christmas holidays. The end sums up the festive period for me. HBO and Netflix make some great stuff.",10
"This series is excellent.The acting, the atmosphere and the directing. A thriller/mystery without paper thin characters.But what blew me away was the homage to the late 70s, early 80s classics.Somehow they took the best from Poltergeist, It, The Thing, Close Encounters & a lot of other cult classics and packaged it into an awesome 80s setting with a creative twist. Modern, and not too corny. I found it downright charming at times.If you aren't a movie buff I think you'll enjoy it for what it is. If you are a movie buff, I think you'll find this series a treat!Also, the kids and the Sheriff in this gives some amazing performances.I don't really have too many gripes with this series. Don't expect a hack n' slash. It's a Thriller/mystery, and it's one of the best I've seen.Recommended!",9
"By the end of the first episode was hooked. The acting capabilities of these kids was honestly amazing. I don't leave many reviews on things, sometimes if it was really bad or really good. This was honestly really good. The sci-fi part of it is super interesting and i loved how they showed the Upside Down just like how Will described it as ""Home but colder"", or something along those lines. At first yo will hate Steve, but near the end when he helps Jonathan and Nancy it shows a positive character development. I loved the person who played Eleven, he acting was amazing, considering she didn't talk much and she had to show her emotions through her facial features, which some actors find hard to do and stay quite plain. MY favorite character was probably Dustin, due to the humor he brings to the story and he is a real ice breaker when things get tough between Lucas and Mike. Mike and Eleven's little relationship is also super cute. The animations blew m mind as well, like when they were in the Upside Down and there were small spores flying everywhere (Which kind of reminded me of The Last Of Us) this series had a kind of 'Super 8' feeling to it, but personally i think it was much better. The story line was more in depth and the characters have a great development throughout the story. There aren't any bad jump scares in it, but it can get a little creepy a times, like when you can see the demogorgon in the photo, which you wouldn't have noticed before, or when you can see the face of the demogorgon trying to get through the wall. I think the implementation of the lights was also super cool, like they knew when someone was in the Upside Down when the lights flickered. I also loved how Mrs Byers kind of made a makeshift Ouija board on the wall, using paint to make the letters and Christmas lights to let will flicker which letter he wants to show. Awesome!Jonathan and Nancy's little coupley moments are also super cute.",10
"This show has everything I do NOT want to have in a mystery show, from using every dumb audience-friendly scenario available, every foreseeable action maneuver used in the last thirty-some years, every cliché that falls into the agreed perspective of prepubescent kids, to nearly non-ending senseless quarrel of - again - prepubescent kids, to a hundred percent not frightening monster manifestations, to really not funny scenes and dialogues between said kids and adults, to a totally unimaginative solution and ending, to....well, I could rant about bad things here for a while, and because everyone is so excited about that show, nobody will notice. My review will simply drown in that unimaginable deep sea of epicures of mediocrity.I will not hide that I am not a lover of both S. Spielberg, whose way of storytelling was obviously a prototype here, and S. King, whose way of horror-telling was a prototype too, but of course I appreciate their greatest works, like 'Duel' and 'Shining'(by courtesy of Stanley Kubrick, of course).What they both have in common is their great nose for what the people want, which is equal to having a nose for making money.The producers of this show are obviously on the same wavelength like their models, thus landing a hit with something so flat and hollow that it evaporates immediately after watching, as opposed to provoke some thoughts at least.The script and story felt for me literally coming out of a construction kit for television hit producers, there was not one scene or one thing going on, that I hadn't seen before elsewhere.Normally I give disasters like this two or three stars here, but three stars are for the child actors, first of all, of course, Millie B. Brown. A rare talent, who manages to say everything with such few words, at her age, that is really remarkable, in a show which is otherwise completely unremarkable.",1
"With Stranger Things Netflix had a big impact on me this year. I a very small time i become addicted to it. In the beginning I was not sure if this movie will win my attention, so I give her a chance that I don't regret. It certainly was the atmosphere that gets darker and darker around the series, the good technical implementation, as well as the acting that made me watching one episode after the other. The Story fells like its playing in 1983. Some of the movie-elements stick in the style of this time, which is creating a lot of charm and its used on purpose to create a specific mood.The first episodes creating the depth of the different characters. After this the series generate a need to keep watching the other episodes.For me Stranger Things is a mixture of the movies ""The Mist"" (2007), ""ET"" (1982) and ""Cloverfield"" (2008). I cannot describe the feeling why I select Cloverfield. Maybe it's the way this series feels. Cloverfield produced the same oppressive feeling in me.Technically Stranger Things has been developed on a very current state of the art. They surprised me with more complex computer-generated effects, as well as environments and objects. Light is used consciously to transfer mood and tension. I liked very much how the creators of the series could tie me up with this mood.",9
"When I saw Stranger Things had a really high score rating, my expectations were raised. Considering this show had many positive reviews, I assumed there would be something outstanding in this show, or some sort of mind-blowing component. I was disappointed. This show barely lived up to my expectations, and it just came off as a rushed, poorly directed alien monster show. There were no wow-factors or anything that took me breath away. Everything was predictable, and they did not leave much up to the viewers to figure out. This, of course, is my personal opinion. One man's trash is another man's treasure. In this case, it was trash.",6
"And the reason for a higher rating is people actually like it. It's OK for people to like something you don't even if you don't understand why. That's actually OK. The rating apparently used to be higher and would be higher than it is if it weren't for all those killjoys whingeing and whining. If it doesn't meet your high expectations don't watch it.I'm rating this 10 to bring the score back up as it rightfully deserves the high rating as one of the most unique celebrations of 80s nostalgia. So what if some people don't care for it, this isn't made for you. Sorry about that. I also enjoyed it as much, as I did Boardwalk Empire and Daredevil. Why do we watch TV shows? Because we enjoy the story. If you don't enjoy it where half to most other people do is that your fault or the creators? I'll leave readers to answer that themselves.I've been revisiting a lot of 80s movies in 2016 and someone told me about Stranger Things - I held off watching it until December and held back from binging the short series to prolong the suspense, even watching a couple of the episodes twice in a row. Far from perfect but I'm very impressed with the ambiance and vibe and pacing. What an accomplishment. So what if it has mundane parts. So what if it has filler, it's stylish. Whatever flaws are present, and I'm sure there are tons (many of which have been articulated comprehensively by indignant IMDb haters), are more or less invisible to this viewer perhaps due to an 80s bias (I grew up in the 80s being born in 1979 - etch-a-sketch, chopper bikes, Garbage Pail kids etc despite being British of course I embraced the indulgent romanticism of 80s American coming-of-age movies) HOWEVER - I'm not a great fan of 80s horror and sci fi (with a few exceptions) and I can't really stand SPIELburg's overly-sentimental and crass contributions to cinema especially ET and Close Encounters. I do respect the work of Stephen King though prefer his dramas to the horror. Despite or maybe because of all this I instantly recognised and enjoyed the parallels between this TV show and 80s titles which the creators were very deliberately and conspicuously paying homage - Stand By Me, The Goonies, Alien, Scanners, the list goes on and on (there are several blogs and entertainment sites listing the titles as well as recommendations for other post-80s films and other more recent releases). Thus the intention of this series is not to be original, as expressed in the polemic of some of the haters, but the intention is specifically NOT TO BE original. In this way the Duffer brothers have tapped into a whole generation with fond memories of retro technology and a time when such technology was in its infancy and entertainment was less cynical and the world in general seemed simpler as we were less connected and consequently more ignorant than we are post-millennium. After all ignorance is bliss.You'll notice I've not really mentioned anything about the content of the show. I'm assuming you've seen it already but if not - check it out and make your own decision. I noticed that the majority of 1 and 2 star reviews (some of them admitting that they would review it 6/10 but they deliberately rated it down to lower the mean rating - which is a cretinous thing to do) the majority of those reviewers it appears had seen the rating, or heard people saying how great it was and so then had the highest expectations - but for some reason these expectations weren't met. Personally I didn't know anything about it at all before I watched it except that it had something to do with the 80s, didn't read any reviews and wasn't aware of IMDb or any other ratings - and I enjoyed it. As a fan of comedy and fantasy but not so much of scifi horror, this show perfectly filtered and watered down vintage horror and added a watertight cast, 80s kids movies nostalgia and topped it off with a lovely ambient synth soundtrack.So this review is for the haters. This show is not perfect but it is entirely comprised of elements that some audiences, myself included, have wanted to see for a very long time. Keep on hating, I'm waiting keenly for season 2 and if it disappoints, so what? It's not even that important! The important thing is that for whatever reasons for the Duffer Brothers, whether they wrote it or not (whereby as they didn't write it according to IMDb reviewer bradcheng; ""their auteur status goes down the drain""), this is a labour of love - demonstrated by it being rejected fifteen times before Netflix - and their love for the material shows in the work, whether it makes sense to some viewers or not, if viewers have the imagination to enact, in the words of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, willing suspension of disbelief (a term which was coined in the discussion of texts like this, involving the supernatural). Like Peter Jackson the Duffers are unabashedly invested in their subject matter and though might not be pioneers of horror/fantasy/scifi they worked hard to realise their vision regardless of whether audiences think they were successful or not. Some audiences like these works - some don't. If you don't, I'm sorry for you, that you don't get it, that you didn't enjoy it. At he end of the day this TV show will quickly and quite rightfully become an instant cult classic, in the words of another historical Englishman ""warts and all"".EDIT
It got worse as it went along so I changed my rating from 10 to 6 but the characters are still interesting, some of the acting became a bit hammy but kinds works of course.I won't get into the esoteric or occult aspects of the show for there are many.",6
"After noticing such high ratings and everyone losing their minds over this show, I gave it a try. Ever since the first episode I still have no idea why there was such an upheaval around this series.Let's break it down to the main components of the show.1) The acting was not so good. The kids were cringeworthy sometimes and, aside from the sheriff and maybe will's mom, the acting was as good as it would be in any one the 1000000 indie series we will never get to hear about.2) The story is really not that original. I mean, it's basically a generic horror movie plot. The D'n'D part was kinda cringeworthy too. It seemed to me like a classic show to kids or pre-teens, where adults are evil (DoE), and the kids are the ""chosen ones"" that will defeat the evil. The whole ""our universe is like one side of a coin"" thing is really old, and it's appeared in so many series that I've lost count.3) The music was good. That was the component I liked the most. The whole soundtrack really captures the essence of the 80s shows, which I think was the goal of the composer.All and all, it's a good show, but it's nothing compared to 9/10 shows here on IMDb, such as Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad or Sherlock (though Sunday's episode was kinda meh).Oh, and as a suggestion, The OA has kind of the same vibe as Stranger Things, but it's waaaaay better. That's a show that deserved at least an 8.5/10. But I guess timing/marketing is everything. Stranger Things arrived in the summer, when kids are out of school and ready to binge watch and hype a lot of shows.",6
"I loved this, and can't wait to see season two. It has a brilliant and gripping story line, well told and well acted by a fantastic cast. It took me right back to the 80's films, and i saw nods to many films i watched back then.Millie Brown is an exceptional young actress, she made me believe she was Eleven, the test subject with super powers, i know we will be seeing a lot of her in the future and rightly so, she was perfect for this part.I was also very impressed with the filming of this show, with so many spooky movies etc having everything done in too dark a setting so you can't tell what is going on, this did not happen here.The lighting was perfect, moody and atmospheric and beautiful at times, it was a pleasure to watch.I simply can't think of anything bad to say about this, please, lots more series!!!",10
"Stranger Things came with a lot of hype that I had a hard time believing. A science fiction show with Winona Ryder as an unstable mother to a boy gone missing under very suspicious circumstances. Netflix hit this one out of the park. They took a piece of a bunch of the best movies (science fiction and otherwise) and threw pieces of them in adding a fairly complex plot as to how scientists accidentally ripped a whole between parallel universes and didn't know how to deal with it. They did a great job of having basically three groups (friends of the kid who went missing, older sister of one of the friends and older brother of boy who went missing, and the mom and sheriff) all working independently to start but with each episode coalescing into a single group fighting the government agency that screwed things up to begin with and the beast from the parallel universe that had stolen the boy (and others). The writing is excellent as they make it build such that it is one of those shows you start to stream and find you can't stop until it is over. Thrilled to see season 2. They did a great job of bringing closure to the first seasons story with a happy ending, but planting just enough seeds that it leaves little doubt there is room for incredible expansion of the story in seasons to come. Netflix is doing a great job with their own productions, but this one stands out to be a potential SciFi classic. Even Breaking Bad didn't leave me this enthused after one season and that is my favorite show of all time.",10
"That's the problem with T.V. shows today and this show is one of the problems when it's going to end. In my opinion I'm tired of seeing the same laziness in shows like Stranger Things, Daredevil, Jessica Jones they all just guilty pleasure with no fresh ideas. And Neflix it's starting to become the huge problem of people laziness in finding anything to watch because they bored until the next new thing. Stranger Things is not an enjoyable show for the mind same thing could be said with Mr.Robot it's just guilty pleasure like Pretty Little Liars, Vampire Diaries, and The Walking Dead where they just going to keep dragging out the story until it doesn't make sense anymore. I have to stop this show before I get suck into another show with no entertaining enjoyment where I can relax and enjoy. Stranger Things is another stable show like Mr. Robot until something new comes long nothing is refreshing and no re watchable value like The Fresh Prince Bel- Air,Friends, Cartoon shows, some daytime sitcoms where you can relax and enjoy it over and over until it's call your favorite show you grown up watching where is the excitement in the show; I already been there and seen it before when I was a child. There's no need to go through with this again. A step back to child/Adult memory Stranger Things is nothing new it copies and paste from other classic movies and t.v. shows; it's getting boring find something refreshing you can enjoy to relax your mind, because this is another guilty pleasure 1/10 for this laziness. I will hold my options open until someone create something new and refreshing to call my favorite.",1
"Nice core story and cool recreation of the 80's environment. Too bad that this includes ripping off many elements from popular films of that time: the series is a combination of ""E.T."", ""Alien,"" ""Signs"" and ""Close Encounters..."" Doesn't anybody have an original idea for a series anymore?And the dialogues are sooo laaame!! As if they were written by the three children who are the main characters. That's a pity, because they really get in the way of enjoying the show. There are so many clichés that this also becomes irritating... How many times can you get away with characters keeping stupid secrets from each other, when there is no need to do that? How many times can characters just say ""trust me on this..."" instead of explaining why they want people to do something?And how come in the parallel universe you have the same buildings, except with weed growing all over them? Why is it always night there? Why are there no people (except a poorly-dressed monster), yet there are lampposts on the streets, but no lights inside buildings?Well, if you're 8 years old, I guess you're not bothered by any of this.",4
"Stranger Things is not only Netflix's best till date but it is a tribute to the glorious 80s and one of the greatest series of this decade which will surely leave a huge impact on society.It's simply Steven Spielberg meets Stephen King. Everyone who is fan of Stephen works and movies like E.T. , Alien , jaws , Stand by me , the goonies , close encounters of third kind and many more will instantly develop a crush to it. First of all Duffer brothers captured the right nostalgia with their superb writing. Today every series try to run for higher audience and critical remarks. Stranger things not only success in these both but also leaves a major crush on it. The Characters are extremely lovable, the story , the twist , environment , atmosphere , story and all the elements including the horror factor makes it a unique tribute and a sort of remake which clearly stands out crystal clear from a crowd of bad remakes and sequels. Not only relating to films the story has both excitement and emotional facts at it center. Each character is immediately a classic whether it be Eleven , Barb or Dustin . The little hints that it contains and all those scenes that reminds us of the very famous films of late 70s and 80s are so so so so so good. To be Simply put there are many many series in Hollywood that are critically acclaimed and loved by audiences but very few have the rare factor that makes them stand out from the crowd to finish at the top and stranger things is one of them . no wonder why both Steven and Stephen are its huge fan.Also all the actors have done a great job which adds to the quality. All I can say is STRANGER THINGS IS DESTINED TO BE HAILED AS A CLASSIC",10
"There's not much one can say about this series other than that it's made for true fans of this genre. If you like the 80s, Stephen King novels, Dungeons and Dragons, are a little geeky and have a good imagination then you'll love it. A small, non-descript town is the perfect backdrop for this story. A group of adolescent boys uncover a mystery surrounding a young girl with super powers who has been part of an experiment to reach another dimension (as you do). The girl is played brilliantly by Millie Bobby Brown who has an emotional depth I've never seen in a child actor before. The story is beautifully told and is entwined with themes of friendship, the importance of family, effects of loss, a mother's love and the drive of friends to live out their fantasies and adventures together. Apparently the Duffers brothers have an affinity for Stephen King and I loved the homages to his novels throughout – I almost felt like it could have been based on one of his books. This series is like comfort food for the soul. I've watched it twice already and think I still have a third viewing in me.",10
"This is definitely a trippy series yet managed to suck me in just like the upside down place!The premise is a bunch of neighbourhood kids doing what you'd expect-riding bikes, playing games, sorting out the ups and downs of suburban life.The adults are going about their business in surreal yet predictable ways.Then one of the kids disappear and all heck breaks loose. Each episode gets stranger and stranger (hence the title) yet works in a weird old school horror flick sort of way.While the premise seems over the top, the writing is on point leading viewers down a fantastic sci-fi path that is refreshing, campy and entertaining. Each episode has an enjoyable 80s tempo.It's a fun series to watch and the acting is great.Winona Ryder plays her role with finesse and gusto as a nervous Nelly single Mom relentless in her pursuit to find her missing son.The closing scenes give us a happy ending where everything is back to normal and then suddenly in the blink of an eye we realize it's not.This well crafted final episode leaves us all waiting in anticipation for season two.Well done Netflix!",8
"The Goonies is just about my favourite movie and Stranger Things recaptures all that excitement of nostalgic adventures and kids believing that life is one big adventure. It's like Stephen King has thrown a dark spin on all the movies I watched growing up. I binge-watched Series One on Netflix and literally couldn't stop. It was exciting, scary, brilliant performances all around and superb design from all departments. I'm not really a fan of sci-fi but there was something about this which immediately grabbed me and made me compelled to keep watching, I think because it sits so well in the 80's. I'd highly recommend Stranger Things to anyone that appreciates stellar performances, particularly from the children, some mystery, intrigue and a nostalgic trip back in time. The soundtrack, production design totally transported me back in time. It makes me want to get a group of friends together, go off to the woods on our bikes and plot how to save the world. Brilliant, brilliant TV.",10
"""You shut up!"" ""No! You shut up!""Above is just one of the amazing lines of dialog you will hear in stranger things - over and over and over and over again. And Winona's winy voice while she screams every line? It makes you jump to turn the volume down! The dialog in this show is often painfully annoying, only equaled by the screaming deliveries. And it is constant! The grating nature of how the characters scream at each other does not let up for the entire season.Screeching aside, Stranger Things is obviously well produced. Everything came together in terms of look, effects and sound - there is a very consistent style that works perfectly for a show with this science fiction/horror theme. It doesn't take long to discover that budget and (nuts and bolts) filmmaking are huge upsides to this show. The producers should be (and I'm sure are) really happy with their creation.And what is Stranger Things? I'd call it a hybrid science fiction/horror tale involving several families from a small American town, with special focus on the kids. The kids are the main characters, and the viewers become involved in their epic adventure. Stranger Things borrows and steals ideas form other film makers and writers, with generally a 1980's feel. There are a lot of interesting ideas ranging from weird science to mental powers to horrific monsters from bizarre alternate realities. Interestingly though - none of it feels fresh - because every idea is a lift from another source.I admit I was pretty excited for this show based upon the premise, but my anticipation was quickly squashed in the first two episodes. I love homage, borrowing - even outright stealing of ideas if they build into something better than the original. But when ideas are taken and squandered, it's just frustrating.I'm not talking about the obvious Carpenter, Spielberg or King lifts - all of which were done (imo) with class. The Carpenter'esque title design, music is excellent. The King horror ideas work pretty well! Most of the Spielberg stuff would be lifts from Poltergeist, and his skill at directing kids - which, again, is pretty slick in how the ideas are merged.But this gets to my gripe - which is very specific - This is the second time Dan Simmons' Summer of Night has been blatantly ripped off - and not in a way that does any justice to this amazingly entertaining book. The first time this book was ripped off was JJ's Super 8 (yea... starting to get more convincing, eh?) - a movie that clearly shares a lot of the same qualities as Stranger Things. Dan Simmons is a brilliant writer, and while Summer of Night is far from his greatest book, it is a very special book to him. The book has a real personal touch, the kids are so believable and captivating, and their trials... to see the blatant lifts, right down to specific character details and story events... it's frustrating!so... my ax is super sharp due to all the grinding - if you like this show, I strongly recommend reading Simmons' Summer of Night.this show? Annoying well made rip off? 6 out of 10",6
"There were some very nice aspects of Stranger Things. Personally, I was watching it for the sci-fi angle. It was more of an X-Files/Goonies/Beverly Hills 90210. The X-Files/Firestarter likeness was cool. Even the Goonies/E.T. type style was OK. The Beverly Hills 90210 teenage drama was sickening. I don't care who likes who, who's sleeping with who or who a sweet young girl is going to lose her virginity to. That very unnecessary aspect of the show very nearly ruined it.Well, that and Winona Ryder--she was awful. I couldn't take the show seriously whenever they put her exaggerated mug on the screen. Goodness, she was such a caricature. I didn't know if she was going for comedy, crazy or an Oscar. She greatly overplayed the distressed-I'm-not-crazy mother role. She was terrible.Strip away the teen love component and Winona Ryder then this was a solid sci-fi series. It's 1983 and a young kid named Will Byers (Noah Schnapp) goes missing. The mom, Joyce Byers (Winona Ryder) is convinced that he's alive and nearby. Coupled with that strange disappearance a young girl named Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) shows up and is able to do some real Professor X-type stuff.The show centers around four distinct characters: Mike Wheeler (Finn Wolfhard), young nerd and leader of his pack. Joyce Byers, distressed mother. Jim Hopper (David Harbour), town sheriff and relentless searcher. Nancy Wheeler (Natalia Dyer), confused teenager in love looking for her friend. As I stated before; two of the characters' stories I couldn't care less about and the other two were the meat and potatoes for me. More bizarre happenings and less soap opera drama and it is a lot better show.",7
"***Contains Spoilers***Stranger Things is filled with everything you could want in a thriller. You've got the lovable goofball, the damsel in distress, the strong independent woman who don't need no man, the young love, a missing red-head, and of course Winona Ryder. So if you haven't seen it, definitely put aside like 8-10 hours and get on that.Set in the early 1980's, the show should bring back some nostalgia for those old enough to have been around during that time. Playing on the belief (and recent confirmation) of government funded experiments by the American's, Stranger Things does an excellent job of piecing together a thriller through eight Chapters, also known as episodes, which take you through the story of a sleepy town in Indiana. Leading to startling discoveries that if you weren't a child younger than 12, you wouldn't have believed it until you saw it.Even though science fiction TV has been extremely popular in the past, (i.e. Doctor Who, Star-Trek, etc.), I have always found it took me a season or two to really get into the story lines. Creating suspense through it's use of fictional horror and the classic dark rooms and night-time scenes, Stranger Things will definitely have you leaving the light on as you go bed for those with a softer disposition.The toothless wonder, Dustin Henderson, by far my favourite character with his perfectly timed dry wit and adorably cute smile. Played exquisitely by Gaten Matarazzo, he actually has no front teeth in real life, meaning his condition, cleidocranial dysplasia, was written into the show just for him. Why we haven't heard of him before is a mystery to me, fingers crossed we'll see him more often in the future, with or without teeth.Which brings me to my second favourite character. Even though she's really only in the first two episodes and we don't get to know her a lot, it does confuse me as to why she kept crossing my mind throughout the rest of the season...oh that's right, because no one was looking for her!!!Why was no one looking for Barb? I mean yes, the government looking officials planted her car at the bus stop to make it seem like it she had run away, but let's be just a tiny bit logical here. We have a Sheriff, with his own sad backstory, going out of his way, like seriously out of his way, to find the answer behind a little boy, Will's, disappearance. So why don't we see the same enthusiastic investigating for Barb's disappearance? Should I be going down a whole feministic, equality, gender double standards rant route here? Should we be looking at the clearly confusing parenting going on by Barb's parents? Why Was No One Looking For Barb? That question will forever haunt me, more so than the monster that comes out of walls in the dark.At least one person was looking for barb, and also stuck in a tricky love triangle at the same time. Nancy's got some game, I won't deny her that. Set-up to be the smart, pretty, shy girl, with her cape-less wonder side-kick, Missing Barb, by her side, Nancy appears to turn to the dark side, Anakin Skywalker style eventually finding her way back in order to help Will's older brother, Jonathan, find Will from the Shadow Realm. Oh, that's brand new information for you? Seriously dude, you need to watch it!!!Even though Nancy's story-line, goes up, down and all around, I am slightly disappointed with who she ends up with at the end. Yes, Steve turned out to be a big-haired jerk at the beginning but he did help defeat the monster in the end AND lets not forget he told his even jerkier friends to bugger off. I mean, he's certainly no Jonathan, who only believed you when you said that Barb had been taken, and not run away, by the monster that took Will that everyone else in the town was saying didn't exist. Nice work. You did good.Finally we come to Winona Ryder, portraying a desperate mother, that can, at times, be slightly annoying, but we forgive her because she's a desperate mother. She didn't even need to steal our hearts, because seeing her desperation and commitment to getting her son back, especially when she hear's his voice, makes you just want to lend her your heart. (See what I did there?)All in all, Stranger Things is a fantastic watch, thrilling right to the end scene and providing revelations that just make your hair stand on end. It even got me thinking a couple times throughout the season if things like this actually do happen and the cover up is just that good. I suppose we'll never know. It seems we all just need to wait for that day when we're called up from sitting at home on the couch watching TV and find it's our time to save the world from a terrifying monster that somehow manages to go unnoticed despite being massive, ugly and killing numerous people. Yep, that's the day we're all waiting for.With the Season Two trailer released earlier in the week, we can only hope that it lives up to its older brother and the hype that, probably won't be as big as Game of Thrones, but will no doubt be there just the same.",9
"I'm in my early 40's and this series paid homage to 'literally' most of my top 20 movies from the 80's.It wasn't perfect, but it was dripping with so much awesome nostalgia I didn't care. It's also perfect for kids aged around 10 to 14 who love movies , and especially older movies. Well to that age group the 80's is old movies. Whereas Super 8 for example was made for a target audience of kids only important.I loved the cast as almost every character outshone themselves, watch this space for a least a couple of future mega stars!This series was great fun, especially to the age groups I've mentioned above.9 out of 10 from me, can't wait for the 2nd season.ETA - I started episode 2 at midnight, and just finished episode 8 now (7am).I'm so tired I'm borderline delirious @_@",7
"I rarely give a perfect 10 for films; out of 715 films I have seen and rated so far in my life (as of February 2017), I have only given a perfect 10 to 25 films--only around 3.5% of the films I have seen. Usually a perfect 10 film tends to be unique, innovative, groundbreaking, pushes the filmmaking artistry to a new level, or touches me personally. This film doesn't really meet such criteria but I gave it a 10 anyway.Sometimes you run across a film or television series that doesn't really push the boundaries but melds all the different elements nicely to produce a perfect film. This is one such television series. I just love how the filmmakers--Duffer brothers--got all the different elements, including acting, a mysterious plot, humour/character interaction, and style to work together seamlessly.If you like a family-oriented (not safe for little kids but main characters are kids and teenagers) series that realistically portrays relationships between parents and kids, while also dealing with a mysterious story, you will probably like this series. I think the acting by the large cast was excellent--not everyone was perfect but overall, the kids, teenagers, and adults acted very well together.The plot is probably the weakest part of the film. Some of it was kind of clichéd and predictable, with some minor parts seeming a bit unrealistic. I think the creators could have made it a bit more darker and unpredictable but I think they wanted to maintain the feel-good vibe, typical of the 80's. I think the careful attention paid to the style of the series, which is a homage to the retro 80s, makes up for the plot shortcomings.Overall, I highly recommend this series to everyone. The plot is a bit predictable so hardcore horror/mystery or art film fans won't like it that much. But I think the family interactions and the 80's style makes up for its shortcomings and rarely is there a film or series that is well made and appealing to a wide audience.",10
"The Duffer Brothers have obviously learned their lessons well, delivering an engaging and highly entertaining first season in a somewhat overwrought genre.The usual shortcomings inherent to mystery-drama-thriller-science fiction, predictability and plausibility, are managed quite well here and generally overcome by stellar performances all around, (Winona Ryder and Millie Bobby Brown are standouts), big budget production values, and a storyline that never veers too far off target. Up to date Grimm fans might be scratching their heads a bit once The Monster is fully revealed, (Isn't that an Alp?), but that doesn't detract from the overall quality or enjoyability of Stranger Things. The real test for the Duffer Brothers will be season 2, when such inherent shortcomings can be more acute and difficult to manage. Especially when the first go around is so successful. Expectations will be high.",9
"Having heard great things about this show, I decided to finally watch it. I have to say that I'm super happy with my decision! It is best to go into this show not knowing too much about it.The show begins with a fantastic first episode, leaving you wanting to know more and making you wonder what the heck is actually going on. The season continues with a lot of suspense and mystery, giving off a science-fiction kind of vibe with a touch of conspiracy.Not only is the story itself super interesting but the characters are actually pretty interesting as well. This is a show where you really do care about the characters (especially the group of young cast members). I also really like the time period that the show is set in. I find it adds to the show's appeal.Overall, the first season of this show is great! Definitely worth watching! I only hope that season 2 will be just as good.",10
"honestly didn't hear anything about this show and just decided to watch it on Netflix as something new and i fell in love with the series, the story is a new take on a lot of older tales but done in the most intriguing way, the cast (while some were unknown before this) are all absolutely fantastic, the characters are human, interesting and actually have a believable quality which makes you root for them all the way, the quality, sets, soundtrack, acting... everything just fits together like a puzzle perfectly showcasing this awesome story, i cant wait for more i have binge watched the 8 episodes twice over and i never once wanted to stop, amazing show, amazing cast and i hope that if you haven't given it a watch try it! it may just blow you away and if not then i hope you find something that gives you as much joy as this show gives me",10
"**I do not want to spoil this series for anyone so I've tried to keep spoilers out of this review.**I finished watching this series within two days. As it has been stated in many reviews this series is a love letter to 1980's Sci-fi and I believe taken inspiration from the director Spielberg and many of his movies. The series brings out the curiosity in the actors minds by allowing them follow conspiracies backed by scientific theories. The audience is drawn in as the series follows a linear approach to its story very easy to follow how ever the Duffer Brothers do know how to build tension without giving much away. The children's acting are second to none, they take the audience on this incredible journey taking you right back to 1980. Anyone who enjoys Sci-fi will appreciate Netflix's monster Mystery Stranger Things.",9
"Stranger Things, with no doubt was one of the best series of the last year, taking us to a different environment, and creating that atmosphere that. For other side, the history is a little predictable, and the end is very expected , but it was really good how the characters and the mystery coexist.",7
"When my best friend told me to watch this, I said - grudgingly - ""I'll give it one episode."" He asked to PLEASE watch 2. Grumble, grumble, grumble. (I'm old: I'm ALLOWED to grumble. You aren't. Not unless you're closing in on 70, too.) Well, the first episode caught me within 10 minutes: a group of boys playing the equivalent of Dungeons and Dragons. They go home, and one boy disappears. Not so unusual so far. But then, it switches to a government lab (natch: located only a couple of miles from the town) and a scientist is running for his life. But who - or what - is he running from? Winona Ryder - barely recognizable - is the mother of two boys, one of whom is part of a group of the 4 boys who are drawn into this mystery when someone shows up at their door. If you want to know more - WATCH IT YOURSELF! The storyline expands so smoothly, the episode is over before you know it. Thats due to excellent - and unforced - scriptwriting that pulls you along. Ryder's unhinged (she was a mental case, as they say, at one point) persona is contrasted by the innocence and completely goodhearted quartet of boys - PLUS ONE. The town sheriff is actually a smart guy, instead of the stereotype of the dumb hick sheriff one frequently sees. And of course, there's the Big, Bad Government who will stop at nothing to locate the ""PLUS ONE."" Just watch it. You will either love it (meaning, if you like good science fiction, it'll grab ya) or you won't, which means you've been watching CW so much, you think that shows like....well, nearly anything on that network, are actually good scriptwriting. Pity if you do. I watched the first two episodes and it's fair to say that, by the time I'd ended the first episode, I thought, ""Well, I can bear to watch the second episode."" And that was my last conscious thought until I found myself bearing down on the end of episode 8. And then it was over and I found myself annoyed because there were no more episodes.",9
"About Stranger Things, I looked forward to this series. But as my rating suggests, it did not deliver.First let me say I am no longer young. Second, I am not so old that I need a film to be explained to me. But I simply did not understand much of what was going on in the final three episodes.More important however was that the characters never seemed to act like real people. Particularly the adults. Case in point, one mother and father in the series never go into their son's room - not once. If they had they'd have discovered with whom he'd been sharing that space and well, that would ruin the story. So, I understand the 'why', but I think it could have been handled lots better.As for the kids' acting; really terrible.Finally, if there was one more scene of the kids jumping onto their bikes I would have screamed. In fact, I did.",1
"Sarcastic title, having finished season 1 a couple of days prior & looking forward to season 2.A great cast, good script & OK visual effects supported by good lighting, this show is a fun throwback to all Things 80's (You see what I did there?)& even part 70's (notice the Jaws' style police uniforms & vehicles). Swiftly combined elements of several film genres & music make for solid entertainment that proves - along with shows like Westworld - series are better then a lot of films that come out these days.There are quite some opinions that state season 1 wraps everything up ambigiously, but not necessarily needs to lead into a 2nd season. I'm rather glad it flows into season 2, which I read was always the intention.Stranger Things is worth the views, check it out!",8
"Watched Stranger Things Featuring Millie Bobby Brown(Intruders) as Eleven ""El"", Finn Wolfhard(Supernatural) as Mike Wheeler, Gaten Matarazzo(The Blacklist) as Dustin Henderson , Caleb McLaughlin(Blue Bloods) as Lucas Sinclair,Natalia Dyer(The Greening Of Whitney Brown) as Nancy Wheeler.Charlie Heaton(Shut In) as Jonathan Byers , Noah Schnapp(Bridge Of Spies) as Jonathan Byers,Cara Buono(The Sorpranos) as Karen Wheeler ,David Harbour(The Equalizer) as Jim Hopper,Matthew Modine(The Dark Knight Rises) as Dr.Martin Brenner, Joe Keery(Chicago Fire) as Steve Harrington, Sadie Sink() as Max,Dacre Montgomery(Safe Neighborhood) as Billy and Winona Ryder(Star Trek,Black Swan) as Joyce Byers.A Little late to the party But I really enjoyed Stranger Things A bit of Slow start and Nancy Wheeler's Romantic subplot drags the series for a bit but also really enjoyed it, its a more Creepier version of Super 8 also really enjoyed the Characters .great Score By Newcomers Kyle Dixon & Michael Stein ,Showrunner(s) Matt & Ross Duffer(Hidden),A More Creepier Version Of Super 8 9/10",9
"The strangest thing about this show is the fact that it is such a huge success. It is presented as an ""original"" series, but there's not a single character or situation in it that you haven's seen dozen times in other movies or TV shows before - just check the IMDb trivia and you will see what I mean. Conspiracy theory? Check. Government cover-up? Check. Alien/extra-dimensional monsters? Check. Shy and sensitive boy falling for the popular girl who dates a fool? Check. Worn-out cop who gets a new break? Check. You name it - if it is a cliché, you will find it here. The cast is OK. Millie Bobby Brown is great and the other kids are good, but Matthew Modine looks uncomfortable as a villain whose voice we barely hear. This show has the undeniable virtue of being addictive and you can easily binge- watch it on a single free day, but then you ask yourself: ""So what?"" I had fun, but I as bored at some points and didn't feel like I had watched a great show like the Marvel and DC pieces I've been going through these days.",5
"Overall, I liked Stranger Things more than I didn't, but I think that the show is overrated.Pros:Like the summary says, the storyline is creative and enjoyable for the most part. The main reason for why I stuck around till the end is because I wanted to know what will happen after each episode. The setting is nice, with the eighties recreated really well. The soundtrack is great, and it works really effectively with the setting. MOST of the characters were well written and acted (note that I said ""most."") Jim Hopper and Will's mother stood out as being especially good.Cons:The show is full of wince inducing clichés. From painfully unrealistic bully clichés, to predictable and overdone dialogue, Stranger Things has it all. It's also extremely cheesy at times. I found myself flipping the screen off on multiple occasions because it got too idiotic for me to handle. It's an unpopular opinion, but I particularly disliked Eleven's character. Though the actress did a decent job at acting what she was given, I felt like her dialogue and gimmick was the most corny out of everyone's. It seemed like her supernatural powers were pulled off in the most cringe worthy manner possible (although nobody seems to agree with me on it.) There are many cheap jump-scares. Although some had good build ups, each one was the same - a sudden roar accompanied by a loud sound effect.To conclude, Stranger Things is okay. With some shows and movies, I can look past the negatives if the rest is good enough, but I struggled to do that on this occasion. I'll probably be watching season 2 to see what it has to offer.",7
"**POSSIBLE SPOILER--VERY SUBTLE**Take the Goonies, make one of their friends an X-Man, put them in E. T., and replace E. T.'s mysterious government organization with the Syndicate from the X-Files, and then throw in liberal amounts of Easter Eggs from dozens of iconic 80s movies and comic books of the 20th century, and you start to get the idea of what Stranger Things is like. Rarely does a sci-fi show or movie hit all of the essential points for a perfect formula. This show manages it brilliantly, and like any good sci-fi, convinces you that this could actually happen, in spite of the fact that the premise is absurd. It does a brilliant job of keeping the focus on our core characters, and telling the story through their limited perspective. Further, the story never misses an opportunity to gradually develop it's characters with exquisite care. Whether we're seeing Joyce's manic desperation escalating, or Nancy's obsession grow, or Michael's infatuation progress we're never rushed and the show takes great care to make sure every character makes sense, and every scene leaves a lasting impression. A great show for binge watching, I absolutely recommend.",10
"Seldom does a television series appear and get this much attention and excitement and praise, and even more seldom does the show actually live up to it all. Stranger Things is delightful science fiction adventure and thrills, with a surprising emotional core. It has so much going for it-- a superb cast, cinematic storytelling, humor, a touch of romance, and goosebumps. Plus a cool synth score that seems like it came right out of a 1983 John Carpenter flick.I came to this series late but am so happy I tried it. It grabbed me by the collar within minutes. Anyone who likes Supernatural, The Goonies, The X-Files, E.T., Kolchak, Stephen King stories ... well, this is a massive treat for you. I could ramble on and on about the actors, the pacing, the 80's period vibe/details, but I will just say, if you're considering Stranger Things, try it. Jump in. It's worthwhile.",9
"Stranger Things is not the only the story about the adventures of Mike, Lucas and Dustin who try to find their missing friend. Nor it is only a story about a mysterious little girl called Eleven. It is something more meaningful, you feel it, the atmosphere and everything that encloses that beautiful TV show. People have different opinions and if you do not like something you do not have to hate on it. Just stay away from it. The down ratings Stranger Things gets are from the people who just can not accept the opinions of others. You can not give a TV show like that one star or two because there is too much effort put in it. My favorite TV show, thank you for that Duffer Brothers.",10
"The degree to which they recreated the style, tone and atmosphere of movies from the early 80s is incredible. Every detail - sets, clothes, props, music, etc. - is exact. I happened to watch The Terminator (the original, 1984) not long after, and you would literally think Stranger Things was made by the same people, in the same year (if you like Stranger Things and for some reason haven't seen The Terminator, watch it now). Throw that movie, Poltergeist, the Goonies, Stand By Me, the Breakfast Club, and numerous other movies from that time period into a blender, and you have Stranger Things.The story is interesting, and the acting is mostly very good. The only negative is that being an 8-part TV series (so far), the pacing drags at times. Some of the actions and events are illogical, and there are a few plot holes. The basic story is kind of standard sci-fi/horror, but it's done very well.Those are minor gripes. The longer format also allows it to cover a wider range of its influences. It's not perfect, but there are few TV shows or movies being made today that are better.",7
"Stranger Things is a Netflix original show created by the Duffer Brothers and it markets itself as a tribute to the classic1980's sci fi and horror culture.I saw the first season after having heard over and over again how great this show is, and immediately a few things stuck out for me, in regards to the show's originality.There is a fine line between paying homage to a book or a movie, and making a blatant rip off. And oftentimes, Stranger Things crosses this line. Some fans and critics have already said, that the writers of this show rely too heavily on nostalgia and on the source material they're supposed to be paying homage to.While recognizing most of the 80's sci fi references, and the plot elements that Stranger Things borrows (E.T., Alien, The Gonies, Stand by Me etc, etc), I also recognize references and entire plot lines that the writers of this show have taken from the 1990's TV-shows, like The X-files, Twin Peaks and even a lesser known sci fi thriller, The Pretender. There are entire scenes and story lines that look like they have been copied off of the X-files (even season 10, which came out last last year).It's difficult to find a modern show about the paranormal and supernatural that hasn't been inspired by The Twilight Zone, The X- files or Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I don't have a problem with that. The X-files was in turn inspired by Kolchak: the Night Stalker, from 1970's, and both the X-files and Stranger Things build their narratives on that ""80's paranoia and government mistrust"", as Chris Carter calls it.The problem is that when you borrow too much from older source material, and when you rely too heavily on the homages and nostalgia, you run the risk of compromising your own originality. And the lack of originality is Stranger Things' greatest weakness. This show doesn't break new ground; it doesn't surprise its audience that already knows their science fiction. Instead, it rehashes the plot elements that are over thirty years old and tells the same story that Chris Carter was telling us twenty years ago.The main antagonist in Stranger Things might as well be The Cigarette Smoking Man, sans the cigarette. The police chief who's drawn into this case, thinking that finding the boy will somehow help him deal with his own tragedies might as well be Fox Mulder or Dale Cooper from Twin Peaks. Or any other noir cop who drinks too much. And the mysterious science lab might as well be the secretive Centre from The Pretender.When critics and reviewers describe Stranger Things as ""Stephen King meets E.T. meets the Goonies, and with a pinch of X-files"" you know what you're dealing with - a potpourri of pop culture references. Well, I got most of those references. Do I get points for that now?Instead of coming up with something new, the writers repackage same old tropes and stories. It's the most shameless way to profit off of nostalgia and the audience's sentimentality. The creators sell us a poorly written story and underdeveloped characters wrapped in a neat bring-your-childhood- back package, hoping that we won't notice the bad product because of all the ""feels"".But it doesn't work for me. Because everything that Stranger Things has to show for - I have seen it before. I love old science fiction (it's basically all I read/watch); I love creepypastas and stories about shady government cover-ups, and this show seems to be made for people like me. But while I'm watching that very first scene, I know that I've seen this before. And I can make a qualified guess about what's going to happen in the next scene. And in the next episode (and I'm right on the money). Every plot twist, every development is recognizable and traceable back to the 80's and 90's source material this show borrows from, which only makes the next twist all the more predictable.Nostalgia baiting and lazy writing, that's basically hat Stranger Things is. That, and hype. Lots and lots of hype.",2
"This is by far one of the greatest artistic creations/accomplishments of more than a decade. Duffer Brothers, you astound me. This series from start to finish (including the composed title music) is an absolute brilliant accomplishment. It's ominous, complicated, a cinematographic brilliance, and much more. The cast Winona Ryder was superb and the young actors couldn't have been a better cast. I absolutely cannot wait until the new season and am making sure everyone I know watches...even if I have to tie them a chair to binge watch season one. An absolute A+++.Cheers!",10
Going through and reading the reviews for the show to those who hate it based on the fact that its not like any of today's shows ... you obviously missed the point it isn't suppose to be like today's shows its a show that is very nostalgic and takes you on a journey to what so many like myself in the 80s enjoyed ... no we didn't have the cgi special effects as what you are use to seeing today but the whole idea of a group of young friends having a wild adventure with a mix of mystery a bit of suspense and some corny fun is what makes 80s movies awesome and this nostalgic look back at that time is beautiful and well done.. what makes it so much more enjoyable is the music I am a huge fan to synth-pop/synth-wave/new-wave and 80s rock and pop ... so maybe you don't like the whole nostalgic pre-cgi corny cliché ridden tale but its Entertainment not meant to be taken seriously and that is what makes it fun ... too many of today's shows is too dry and lacks that fun element ... this is a break from all that actually its nice to just see a show that isn't pushing an agenda.,10
"I gave Stranger Things a watch after hearing good things about it. After doing that, it's now one of my favorite sci-fi TV shows. Everything about it is very well done. The storyline, characters, and music were great. The kid actors did a very good job and didn't come off as annoying. The best actors in Stranger Things were Millie Bobbie Brown and David Harbour who play Eleven and Sheriff Hopper respectively. Stranger Things has a great 80's vibe. I loved the influences from Stephen King, Elfen Lied, and other things from the 80's. I don't want to spoil the storyline for season one because it was so good. Can't wait for season two to come out. The new season can't come any quicker.",10
"To me watching Stranger Things was really engaging. Even though I'm not a native speaker it was quite easy to understand, it was the first TV show that I watched without Portuguese subtitles. A bad aspect was that the rhythm was very slow sometimes because maybe they wanted to keep the mystery until the last episode. In spite of that the actors were really capable and great. I recommend the show to everybody who likes terror and thriller, mainly teens.",8
"This show is very exciting and interesting. In the following i try to explain why I think that. The show 'Stranger Things' is pretty new and kind off reminds of shows like X-factor etc. The show tries to create a certain 80's horror movie vibe and does it well, especially with the setting and the time it plays in. Every episode is well thought out and filmed in a way that every minute is exciting. The music and the sounds highlight certain events very well and gives the show an intense feel to it. You can always watch this show, even with your family. This show fits many personal preferences so many persons with different preferences can watch this show together. (Like in my Family) The characters also very well thought out and I always love it when when you get to like certain characters and to dislike certain characters. All in all you can say that this show is very good and exciting.",10
"Well, this is really something you must watch! Everything about Stranger Things is absolutely amazing. I simply love the 80's! I was so hooked on it that I haven't slept all night even though I knew I need to go to work next morning. Winona Ryder astound me with her acting. And the kids...oh, boy...they are fantastic. Millie especially. She could be a big star in the future. The only thing that bothers me is...I can't wait for season 2 to come up!",10
"get up, come on get down with the table get up, come on get down with the dickness get up, come on get down with my penis open up your mouth and let me give it to yoooooooouAside from that, this show is absolutely f*cking amazing. If you do not watch this show, you are not alive. The acting is top-notch, the theme is great, and if you have sex while watching this show, you'll probably focus on the show moreso than the sex. It's amazing. Watch it.",10
"A young, brown-haired boy rides his bike down a moonlit street. Suddenly, the headlight on his bike goes out. After glancing down at the light, he looks back up to see a monstrous figure standing in the middle of the road, causing him to veer off into a ditch. He sprints away from his crashed bike into the woods. Whatever he saw, it wasn't human. And it was pursuing him.With haste, the boy darts through the front door of his house, out the back and into a tiny shed in his backyard.Silence.Hands trembling, the boy grabs his family rifle and loads it.The shed door creaks.His breathing quickens. He aims the rifle at the door.A low growl emits from the darkness as a shadow slowly rises behind the boy. He locks eyes with the hidden creature, allowing terror to consume him.Tension builds with the score; the fizzling of the shed's lone light bulb grows louder and louder as the camera zooms in on itSilence. A wide shot of an empty shed. The light bulb lingers as the scene gradually fades to black.On July 15, 2016, my parents and I sat down to watch the pilot for a Netflix original series called ""Stranger Things."" From the opening sequence described above, we knew we were in for something special.The story revolves around the mysterious disappearance of 11-year-old Will Byers and the odd rippling effect it has on the residents and atmosphere of 1983 Hawkins, Indiana. Will's mother, Joyce – a single mom already struggling with her own issues – becomes frantic and distressed in her son's absence.At first, the town seems unconcerned. ""Will probably just ran away,"" or, ""maybe he's hiding?"" Disappearances like this were rare at the time, as local police chief Jim Hopper is quick to point out. He says, ""You want to know the worst thing that's happened here in the four years I've worked here? The worst thing? It was when an owl attacked Eleanor Gillespie because it thought her hair was a nest.""As the investigation deepens, however, another person goes missing. A secret government facility is discovered in the woods of Hawkins, and a young girl named Eleven is revealed to have the power of telekinesis.My biggest fear for this show after seeing the trailer was that it would live up to its name, that its sci-fi and fantasy elements would overpower any sort of depth and realism present. While there are plenty of bizarre moments and far-fetched concepts in ""Stranger Things,"" they exist only to compliment the characters that keep us grounded in reality.The three main characters are 11-year-old friends of Will's named Mike, Dustin and Lucas, and Finn Wolfhard, Gaten Matarazzo and Caleb McLaughlin do an excellent job at bringing them to life. They play ""Dungeons and Dragons"" in their parents' basements. They laugh. They curse. They fight. It all feels genuine, and when Will goes missing, they band together and risk their lives to find him.Winona Ryder and David Harbour shine as Joyce Byers and Chief Hopper, respectively. Ryder conveys well the desperation any mother would feel after the disappearance of her son, as well as the raw determination to find him and bring him home. The character arc of Hopper from complacent drunk to fearless leader is also incredibly satisfying to watch.Amongst all of the great performances, however, the standout is easily Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven. Her character is shrouded in mystery and secrecy. She has a dark and troubled past, and her superhuman abilities serve as a gift and a curse throughout the story.Eleven's dialogue is limited, meaning that most of her character had to be communicated through facial expressions, mannerisms and inner dialogue, and 12-year-old Brown accomplishes this masterfully.""Stranger Things"" takes us back to the world of the 1980s, a world of Realistic-branded walkie talkies, Levi's corduroy jackets and wood-paneled station wagons. It was a time when kids could ride their bikes home at night without the fear of being kidnapped; when privacy on a phone call was dependent on the length of your rotary telephone chord.Its soundtrack is infused with 80s classics. In one scene, Will and his brother, Jonathan (Charlie Heaton), bond over ""Should I Stay or Should I Go"" by The Clash. In another, romance blossoms to the sounds of Toto's ""Africa.""Above all, ""Stranger Things"" is a love letter to 80s film. The tune of the opening credits is set to 80s-style synthesizers, which were commonly used in B-level horror movies at the time. Long hikes along railroad tracks evoke images of 1986's ""Stand By Me."" And as the children and Eleven fled the evil government scientists on their bikes, I'm sure that somewhere Steven Spielberg shed tears of joy on E.T.'s behalf.The Duffer Brothers have utilized the power of Netflix to create something unique. ""Stranger Things"" provides loads of 80s nostalgia for adults, while also reintroducing us millennials to the staples of that era. It is horrifying and uplifting; darkly humorous; unrealistic, yet somehow grounded in reality.With season two on the horizon and with presumably many stories left to tell, ""Stranger Things"" has only scratched the surface of its potential. Hopefully in the not-so-distant future, we will be able to look back on ""Stranger Things"" as a classic, a ""Goonies"" for our generation to pass onto the next. After all, stranger things have happened.",10
"This show is amazing and me and my whole family love it, especially the fact that there is no political correctness, Please please please keep out all the gay and trans crap!!!!!!!!! It isn't needed and also more Easter eggs please, I love all of that. This is show is definitely ten out of 10 though.",10
"Stranger Things is a 1980s inspired and themed science fiction horror Netflix show. The show is set in November 1983 and takes place in the fictional town of Hawkins. Hawkins residence live a fairly normal life until a boy named Will Byers goes missing in the woods. Three of Wills friends Mike Wheeler (played by Finn Wolfhard), Lucas Sinclair (played by Caleb McLaughin) and Dustin Henderson (played by Gaten Matarazzo) are very worried for him but what they uncover something more dark and sinister. After looking for their missing friend they come across a girl, who they call Eleven because of her tattoo. However they soon find out this isn't any ordinary girl but one with very special powers. It is very clear the show takes lot of inspiration from classics 80's films like The Goonies and ET.The performances from all of the cast are great especially the child actors, who show the right amount of charisma and banter you expect from kids growing up in the 80's. However, the star of the show here is definitely Eleven (played by Millie Bobby Brown) who plays the ET type of role in show. Millie's brilliant acting skills have a lasting effect on the viewer even though she has 42 words throughout the whole series.The Duffer Brothers brilliant writing and directing skills play with your emotions to create a love letter to all those 80's horror films. It's truly something special! 9/10",9
"Best TV show I have seen in years. Characters are believable, plot is amazing, actors are great! I read a review somewhere that said it reminded old adventures produced by Steven Spielberg and I cannot make a better statement. Even though the trailer seems too dark, it doesn't happen during the episodes. It is a brilliant show, engaging and funny.",10
"Stranger Things is the decade's ultimate 80s love-letter, and an innovator for internet television. And where better to release the show than on Netflix, the world's fastest- growing streaming service? Stranger Things is not only a memorable chapter for the 'Golden Age of Television' but also another great addition to Netflix's ever-expanding library of original productions. Alongside Daredevil, 13 Reasons Why, House of Cards, Orange is the New Black and the relaunch of Black Mirror; Stranger Things is another great addition to the streaming service/network.Stranger is everything you'd want from an 80s-set TV show: Spielberg-homages, Star Wars references, parallels to Xmen, conspiracy theories, and an adventure about childhood: filled with bicycles, mystery and realising what it takes to grow up.Stranger Things is simple yet fantastic. Small scale yet ambitious. Everything is done so well here. Definitely worth the monthly subscription to Netflix alone. Watch it now when you have the chance! Before Season 2 premieres this year!",10
"Stranger Things (season 1) is set in 1983 and is an amazing recreation of that time period with great acting from all roles but especially great acting from all the child actors, some of the best I have seen.I really enjoyed the entire story from every episode of the first season. The cinematography was phenomenal and the story was perfect and gripping.As of writing this review I have watched 3 times and plan to watch it at least twice more before the next season airs.",10
"What especially impressed me was the uniformly excellent acting of the children - really very impressive.I always think ""tone"" is one of the most important qualities a movie needs to possess - it needs to be coherent, well-thought out & consistent. ""Stranger Things"" has a very particular tone - the '80's feel, the homage to horror/sci fi/fantasy traditions - that is perfectly realized. It manages to be referential & ""cliched"" while still seeming fresh & original - a very clever trick. Congratulations to the Duffer Brothers!",9
"Important thing for any series is,you should go to next episode eagerly. This is achieved by this series.You keep on asking questions and you next thing is you will get more questions.Within 10 minutes you will get hooked to this series.Pace of each episode is great and has only eight episodes.Viewer who like investigation and sci-fi and are new to this genre will like this series. But viewers who have watched already number of good sci-fi and horror series or movies Will find it old stuff. All the characters are well written and developed over the series.Only negative thing is that,the story is clichéd as you go towards the conclusion. Hope they work on the story for the second season. This series is especially for children. I could have given 8,but towards the conclusion has disappointed me.",7
"I kept getting told to watch this show but didn't finally give in until February 2017 after seeing the Super Bowl ad for 'Stranger Things 2'. I watched 'The Twilight Zone', 'Star Trek' (Original), 'The X-Files' and a host of other shows but this is among the best shows I've ever seen.The entire cast is phenomenal and displays a great balance of adult life, teenage life and childhood. They do a great job with the kids especially, making them feel like the kids we all grew up watching in 'E.T.' and 'The Goonies'.The story is second to none. I watched the entire first season in 3 days, watching the final 4 episodes on the 3rd day. The entire plot centers around the mysterious disappearance of Will Byers. A boy who ultimately won't be found within the confines of our reality. Then a girl classified as '011' becomes known as Eleven or El after she joins the group of boys looking for Will.Winona Ryder is particularly impressive. Anyone who remembers her movies like 'Lucas', 'Beetlejuice', 'Edward Scissorhands' and 'Girl Interrupted' may confidently say this is her greatest work. I was never a big fan or her not did I ever dislike her, but she impressed me in this series. Winona's acting is unbelievable and her dedication to the story is outstanding.David Harbour's Jim Hopper is perhaps the most intriguing character. He varies from lazy and uncaring, to a dedicated investigator, to going far beyond the call of duty to making puzzling deals.We then have the saga of teenagers with Nancy, her boyfriend to be Steve, Nancy's friend Barb and Will's older brother Jonathan who is searching for his brother. Nancy is really in a tough situation throughout the series, caught up in a love triangle, battling her mother for her own independence and attempting to solve the disappearance of her missing and presumably dead best friend Barb. This situation draws Nancy and Jonathan together.The most rewarding part of the series is when the groups of characters finally all come together and share the information they've individually discovered.",10
"If you are a kid of the 80s (or not so a kid), this is definitely your series to watch. The aesthetic is similar to those brilliant adventure movies from the 80s like ET or the Goonies. As for the story, we could say it's a mix between The X Files, Poltergeist and ET (kind of). First of all, this is not a horror series, although you might get a scare once in a while, but is more of a thriller. Something strange is going on, and since the first second you might guess what is it, but you won't understand what really is it until about half of the season. The season consists only of 8 episodes, so it is easier to watch it in a row, as once you start watching one you won't be able to put it down until you are down; and I am talking from experience.Then we have the actors, all kids are brilliant in their characters, you really feel like flying with them on their bikes. As for the adults, Winona Ryder is back into action and what a way to come back!! She plays the stressed mother whose kid has gone missing, although at sometimes it looks like she is overacting, she is simply wonderful and makes us remember on why she was one of the best way down in the 90s. Do we hear a Golden Globe nomination? Maybe.Fantastic Netflix original work (finally!). Not a sequel, not a movie adaptation, but something original. Yes, influenced by Stephen King's works and that 80 style which makes us feel nostalgic, which might be one of the incentives to watch it, so please watch it, you won't regret it! Just stop what you are doing and go binge-watch it! It's only 8 hours, one Sunday are you are done! Go for it!",9
"I got to tell you, Stranger Things is one hell of an awesome ride since I've watched the movie Super 8 for the first time back then. There's no spoilers, so you're good. I must say, in my opinion, this show felt like Super 8 but it's more thrilling than Super 8, but it's very entertaining. I recommend you guys to watch it if you have not seen it yet. :)What I also like about this show is that it's from a Co-Executive Producer who once produced a TV Film Adaptation of Disney's Tower of Terror. :)",10
"Stranger things is a product of 2016 and people should pay attention to this. It surely used old well-known elements or settings from the 1980s but I believe that people should stop thinking of films in the 80s and stop comparing it to them. Let us take a look at the series objectively and from the modern point of view ! Surely it belongs to a genre that was started a long time ago and the 1980 nostalgia exists but please do not overreact because of this fact. Analyzing STRANGER THINGS in short: 1. The most important part of a cinema masterpiece or a TV series is the script. The script is just great, keeps you interested and does not involve retarded mistakes or plot holes. Some scenes might develop in a more obvious way that I like (i.e. not so original) and some words might not be the perfect choice in some cases /IMHO at least/... Then again originality is rarer than gold these days. But to be honest the script as a whole is just fine through the whole season 1. The script here lays a great and sturdy foundation of the ""family house"" the creators are building. A house of mystery, fear and bravery, of action and of basic human emotions. 2. The actors are amazing. The kids are natural, Dustin in particular is just the kind of kid that people will love and the kind of actor that is acting using his talent and to the best of his ability. Winona Ryder gives us a lot of strong emotions to chew and surely lives up to the image of a movie star she had in the past /and probably never lost/. 3. The effects are probably not the maximum possible movie high-tech wonder but they look cool and fitting to the main atmosphere. I surely do not expect more of the FX team for season 2. 4. The more you watch, the more interested you are. It does not get boring. Stranger Things does not crumble because of some soap opera motives like ARROW did. 5. You just have to like kids and sci-fi to watch, if you do not like kids just get out of here. :) ------------------------------------- Obvviously it is not plausible to just talk about what I liked about Stranger Things so let me point out some weak spots: - the bad guys often behave in a stupid and inert way - the cop sometimes takes weird decisions - several things in the last episode were very unacceptable, I don't wish to include spoilers...If Game of Thrones should get the gold medal for the best series of 2016, Stranger Things goes home with the silver ! 9/10",9
"Well done Netflix. What a great series. I binge watched all the 8 episodes in one day and still wanted more. I am left wondering a lot of things after the final episode. I also have questions about Will's dog. I think there is something special there. Why was the dog in the house was when Will came bursting home and no one else was there at that time? Wow, what a fantastic cast. They all work together so beautifully. Some absolutely magic performances and I can see awards being won by this show and individuals in the cast. Millie Brown is a natural. A real special talent indeed. I was really taken by Millie's facial expressions. I must say that Matthew Modine played an outstanding slimy rat. I did not like his character the first time I saw him. Well done Matt. Not really wanting to single out any individuals from an equally terrific bunch, but I hope credit is given to great performers. I was just blown away with the 1980 props eg: that left over from the 70's teak timber wall panelling; sickening colour schemes; the technology of the day (phones and walkie talkies) various furnishings, ornaments (I noticed the glass Christmas tree which came full of chocolate coated nuts), cloths, and hair styles etc which were all gorily awesome in their detail. Was it really that bad? It is full of fun clichés but it's like a good book you can't put down. I gave it a 10 star rating, and I thank all those involved.",10
"Stranger Things is a series that takes us back to the good old 80's and 90's. By watching it we are automatically referred to this time when the Steven Spielberg films were alarmingly successful. ET; Carrie; And so many other films of the genre seem to be reminiscent of excerpts from Stranger Things, which leaves the viewer with that air of nostalgia and this is a good emotional effect that TV shows and well- made movies cause in viewers. I really appreciate that genre.",10
"Well for my first review ...This series are Epic for a scary on a regular basis maybe 15 years for my opinion well i did see only 2 episodes and my excitement for what will happen next has no words to explain . Well for me it will be the epic intro for the new Alien movie :P , i feel a lot of dramatic content and it is my most newly experience of this sort of a movie mix.",10
I hope everyone reading this blog have seen the film E.T by Steven Spielberg and if you haven't seen the film please go and check it out because it's an awesome film which has inspired several other films and shows for more than 20 years in the sci-fi genre and this show is one of them.This show has not only taken the sci-fi element of the movie but also the style of it's execution.It just means the show has many similarities with the movie and had a great impact on the audience.The show is crazy and the amount of accolades it got was equally crazy.Check out articles like this at : www.paul96.orgArticles related to the show :http://paul96.org/stranger-things-the-enhanced-little-one/ http://paul96.org/eleven-the-ferocious-wonder-kid/ http://paul96.org/mike-wheeler-and-friends-the-four-lads-of-hawkins/ http://paul96.org/stranger-things-other-characters/ http://paul96.org/the-concept-of-super-powers-subjecteleven/ http://paul96.org/stranger-things-the-best-episodes/,10
"This a very good series. It atmospherically reanimates the 1980s, a decade which despite never having seen myself, seems to be the home of many of my favorite stories. The series's reliance on child actors, a bet which I think rarely turns out well for directors, seems to have succeeded here. The special effects were masterfully and more importantly tastefully done.Winona Ryder is the real star of the series though, and her portrayal of haggard single mother is mundane and brilliant. Another great Netflix series! I look forward to watching the next season.(I binged this in February 2017.)",9
Stranger Things did in 2016 what 13 Reasons Why has done in 2017!! Took everyone by surprise and turned out to be one of the best new shows in their respective years!! ????The four kids in Stranger Things act in a way not even the adults could... and that's what adds to the awesomeness of this show!! Consisting of only 8 episodes in the 1st season... a little less as you may think... but such less itself leaves you spellbound!! ????The 2nd season of the show is scheduled to arrive in the second half of 2017 as the rumours say... which will be keen to set new landmarks for the supernatural genre for the TV shows!! ????,10
"Stranger Things is what I consider to be the best Netflix original series to date. Not only does it include references to the works of Steven Spielberg, Wes Craven, Stephen King, and many other prominent creators of the 70s and 80s, But also features relate able, and well developed characters that are all given so much to do. No one in the series feels unnecessary or just thrown in, they all have good character motivation and they don't just do things for no reason. Even when a character does do something that is kind of dumb you can at least see where there coming from.There are much more things about this series that's great, but, I don't want to spoil anything, and I kinda wanna keep this as short as possible, so all I can say is that if you're a fan of any of the writers and directors I previously named or just science fiction in general, then this series is definitely for you.",9
"Let me explain first. I am a big fun of sci-fi pictures - not only from the 80's - but this is not a good one. OK if you like ET, X-files, Cocoon and similar films then you probably like this one. But if you seek for real sci-fi suspense then stay away. So much fuss for nothing. OK I must say that Mrs. Rhyder tries hard and kids act decent but that's all. I prefer go and watch again the Goonies or Philadelphia experiment.. Slow, spiritless, nerveless and without inspiration.",8
This show just blew me away when I first watched it it's amazing and the 80s setting was great because that's when I grew up but I hope for the new season there is more episodes because there was only 8 for the first season but they do that sometimes just to see if people like the show so they probably will be more roll on October.CANT WAIT.!!!!!!,10
"This is a television series that's set in Indiana and has won several awards. It's a mixture of drama, horror, mystery and science fiction.The first season is set in 1983 and was released in July 2016. The second season is set in 1984 and is due to be released in October 2017.A young boy goes missing and his friends look for him. They instead find a young girl who has telekinetic powers. The authorities claim that the boy has been found dead. However, some residents discover that his corpse is actually a dummy and that he's alive. They then try to establish contact with him.The writing and acting are good and it's significantly better than most TV series. However, it's slow in parts and I don't agree that it's outstanding.",8
"Cinematography: All of the scenes are filmed very well, the Red Dragon really shines here. Definitely made for a 4k TV. The CGI is really good and the old Film effect really helps with the atmosphere.Cast: The cast really makes this show special. The kids are some of the best child actors i have ever seen.Story: The story is very different from many other story lines, and it always surprised me. F.ex. Not the typical Lovestory with the Hero saving the girl and then becoming her boyfriend and rather a story about the hero then helping her even more and becoming some sort of friends. it doesn't get boring.The Soundtrack: It is awesome.I really don't understand the bad Reviews, watched the show in one day straight.",10
"If the influences from 80's movies and the actors being children is the most important things you can praise this series for, it proves that its not that good. Story-wise it looks like one good Fringe episode stretched over a whole season and you guess it so early it loses its magic. Yes it is well set up, children are great and 80's thing might pick up your fancy but all these just didn't work for me to forgive the weak plot. Referencing 80's, synth music and all seems like an easy way out these days.",1
"Obviously, it is so highly-rated because of its lofty ambitions & qualities for a ""TV show"", sort of like Twin Peaks & only a couple of others. It is also fun to spot the '80s artifacts & references, esp to films. Did everyone catch the Ferris Bueller one? It is also hard to stop watching anything with some kind of ""TBD"" monster waiting to be shown. However, the problems: ET-worship goes overboard by the 4th episode. The good-girl-trying-to-go-bad schtick is a main reason for Freaks & Geeks being canceled after 1 great season. The characters and their relationships are ALL Cliché. Every single character has been done basically exactly like this in a previous (multiple) film or TV show. Here's one: where have you seen anti-social-male-teen-from-wrong-side-of-tracks interacts with world through photography before? Stock character. Check. Starting in episode 3 or 4 (iirc), characters started to make inexplicable decisions, e.g. the sheriff breaking into the top-secret federal base, the good-girl-trying-to-go-bad entering the Upside-Down, etc & the show started to go off the rails.I will almost certainly not watch Season 2. The Duffers get ""A"" for synthesis but ""D"" for originality.",6
"My episode by episode ratings will give you an idea of the kind of show it is and how good it is:Ep1- 9/10 Ep2- 8/10 Ep3- 7/10 Ep4- 10/10 Ep5- 6/10 Ep6- 7/10 Ep7- 8/10 Ep8- 8/10Because there's no excellent elevation, we'll take the cumulative average:7.8/10It's a pretty good show that starts compelling, but that by episodes 5-6 really loses its steam. It regains some in episodes 7-8 but never hits its two best from early on. Ep 4 is the best one.The directing and editing is superb and casting is good. I liked it and would recommend a look, especially at the first 4 episodes, but eps 5-6 you could miss most of and not miss much.A decent show that once again proves just how elite Breaking Bad was because it doesn't come close to it.7/10",7
"The first season is amazing! I have been anxiously awaiting the second season, and then I watched the trailer. As excited as I am to see what happens, I am completely walking away from it simply because it found a way to include a deservedly dead pedophile's music. I understand the era and time it was popular, but there are many more musical hits that could have been used. Thanks for ruining the series for me!",10
"First and foremost, Stranger Things is a very entertaining show. The acting, 80's references and a general lighthearted tone all mash to make a compelling show. The entire first season is about find Will Byers, a 12 year old boy that disappeared into the ""Upside Down"" a alternate dimension that corresponds with our world. After Will disappears, his friends find a girl (nicknamed Eleven) that says she knows where Will is. There are subplots that interlock with the story that are all interesting.When I first heard about the show, the idea of a show built around child actor worried me a bit. Child actors, mostly, fall into two categories: genuine and disingenuous. Luckily the excellent direction from the Duffer Brothers and the performances from the kids fall into the former. 80's culture is perfectly ingrained into the story. There isn't too many, nor are they made the focal point of show. The film grain on the show is subtle enough to be noticeable to the audience, but again, is not too obvious. The music is mostly good, but it can be too electronic at times.My problems with the show start with the demogorgon, a monster that lives in the Upside Down. **Minor spoilers** The demogorgon comes into real life through the wall in a sequence that feels like a bad sequel to The Last of Us. The build up for the creature is immense, but both the look and actions of the monster fall flat. Scenes like this lack real stakes, and this does not have much tension. **Major Spoilers** The last major scene has Eleven sacrifice herself to the demogorgon as she disappeared into the Upside Down. This was entirely forced and contrived. The series builds Eleven as essential to the puzzle that is the Upside Down, but this scene uses her as a plot device. It is your classic set up for another season that shies away from themes introduced through the entire season. It's a shame.But those are just a few of my complaints. I doubt most people will have a problem with them. Overall though, it's just such a fun show to watch and I'm excited to see where it goes. Happy Bingeing!",8
"The high ratings for this show continue to surprise me a year later. Terrible, plagiarized tripe, from two brothers who would make the Chuckle Brothers look like the Coppola's.It just kept getting worse and worse - silly acting, predictable story- line plagiarised from countless 80's classics and dumbed-down to the extent where it became laughable.Truly sickening to see this utter tripe lauded by so many. I shall not be watching the second season of this garbage.",1
This series is about things that are strange stranger things it's amazing it's so good I was Hoocked two or three episodes episodes in . even tho I was wondering why am I hooked I don't like but I do. It's so good kids killed it it's so amazing its about a kid named will and his missing from town. from the 80s and ET and Steven kings novels and 80s said nostalgia the cop also is amazing he is so good he is investing and interesting and deserves nomination. these kids deserve enemies that's how good they. Warning spoilers are coming so u r warned 11 was amazing one of the best characters is the who show if this doesn't start i career I don't what does she oops almost think it is a he. 11 is so good and deserves A Emmy i don't know why she doesn't have a nomination unless she does one Of The scenes that I starting liking the show was when u starting caring for these characters in this show. It had great dialogue in this series s. One of my favourite scenes is when 11 shows off her super powers I felt how the kids felt cause I was a kid and I felt the connection they did I was actually a kid unlike kids now. actors today never get sprites that kids say kids say kids things like me when I was a kid a kid. I There r scenes that r just like ET like when they all are talking to each other and it's like ET and stand by me they have the power guy which is 11 and then it was ET they have a scene on the train track it's literally stand by me and then they have Goonies things like so many times then they have so many references the one thing that makes it not a perfect series. But it's not two grades down because of that it's not ET or standing by me for me it's not that level of goodness but it's good tho and don't get disappointing . Its just a series or is it. back on topic it's so good. when will is missing the people think the mom is crazy but later we find out she is not crazy the things out kids say kids things like me when I was a kid a Re crazy when will is found he is very bad and is sick and barely survives it's sad but true. The kids think it is gone but the monster is still out there. To cap off the review it is a entertaining series just a mystery. The kids and adults do good thing s so I would say 8.5 out of 10 it's amazing and the best show in years dispose me not watching any shows in years ??,8
"Merits: The season is very short in compared to other TV series. This makes it watchable as you don't have to invest so much time- 8 episodes versus 22! The cast was excellent. Hats off to David Harbour and Millie Bobby Brown. They were brilliant! The Upside Down concept was good, though it couldn't be connected properly to the creature.Demerits:E05- Why didn't Nancy and Johnathan go together through a passage to the Upside Down? Was Nancy had that brevity? And how did she escape the passage, when it was shown that the creepy creature saw her! E07- How come Barbara couldn't be saved and Will was? At least they could have tried! The last major scene was entirely forced and contrived.. Eleven vaporized so that they can show her coming alive in the Second Season was totally unnecessary.Overall, a one-time good watch!",7
"the only very amazing thing about this is the setting or mise en scene of the 80's; including the photography, music and dressing of the characters. Winona also has a solid performance, as an experienced actress. Everything else is f*king stupid. WHY THE HYPE? It's a generic story with generic characters who are not likable, except for the curly haired kid. Sci-Fi? really? please...Waste of time. I know everyone loves the bald kid, this show, the ""love stories"", but I'm not one of them. i don't see anything special about this, AT ALL. Seriously, why you like this, people? If we're talking about weird ""sci-fi"" stuff who has no scientific background whatsoever you can totally watch Twin Peaks. WAY BETTER. This is laughable, boring, generic, and too long for the slow paced and weak story line.",2
"Stranger Things. Long story short: I loved it. I watched the first season in two days only. However, before I start watching it, I didn't know if I was going to like. I mean I didn't watch any trailer or read any review. I began without knowing what it was. I watched the first episode, and then I could not stop. The actors play very well. Moreover, I'm a big fan of David Harbour. Then, the story is perfect. In each episode, there is more suspense and we want to know what happens next. I really love the way that the series is shot. The thrill is maintained and the feelings are forwarded. So I can undoubtedly tell you that Stranger Things is one of the best TV Shows you'll ever see.",10
"A reprise staged with ambiance, fiefdom of classical 80's hits like E.T., X-Files and The Exorcist, this show is a time traveler for fans who love the 80's and want to see a reboot from best of both worlds.Though I've followed GOT, Walking Dead, Dexter, Supernatural, Sense8, X-Files, Twin Peaks and some of the best series out there, I rarely write reviews, but this one is an exception.It brings the best of everything that an 80's born would love to see. Winona Ryder justifies her role of a strong, persistent mother who wants to save her child from evil. And the Kids, yes they're portrayed like 80's kids, damn, you'd just want to give away everything to see their pure childish innocence, will, wit and clan.Makes you think; Did we miss the best of our generation and is it behind us and long gone, no, optimistically it's not gone.",10
"Whoever wrote the script and directed this series didn't do their homework, or the story was written by AI. All of the storylines are taken from some other shows in the past and put together under different names and situations. The protagonist can't act well. He shows his frustrations in his facial expressions too often. He doesn't establish chemistry with the female lead. The female lead is a typical woman reacting to dangerous situations with indredulity and confusion. The director should have had some ideas for making the acting more credible. Each time, one character appears who represents each player of the story, the Asian woman who works in the White House, the terminator guy who represents the FBI, etc. Acting is wooden and the story is predictable. The car chase scene in episode one is almost laughable. They shouldn't put in a car chase if they can't outdo myriads of other car chase scenes already tried before. Overall, a terrible disappointment.",4
"First of all the acting was refreshing but that was expected given the cast members.One might be quick to consider The Night Agent to be yet another conspiracy thriller series full of the same clichés and contrivances that you'd expect. It's true that this isn't the most original show of the year, but at the same time, that doesn't prevent it from being an incredibly engaging watch. With 10 episodes, each clocking in around 45 to 50 minutes, The Night Agent is exciting, addicting, and successfully able to balance a storyline that could have easily become over-complicated. We've seen shows like this that start off promising but then fall victim to an overcomplicated plot where if you even blink, you may be missing a key plot detail. That isn't what The Night Agent is. The storyline is concise and easy to follow without ever descending into simplicity. While there are certainly moments that aren't the most realistic, it never takes you out or makes you stop caring.",8
"The first episode is highly derivative. If, while watching this you think to yourself, ""I've seen this before,"" you have. The train bombing scene is very similar to the one in ""Source Code (2011).Even the title of the series is derivative of John Le Carre's book ""The Night Manager.....and the tv mini-series of the same name. I could not find anything similar, other than the name of ""The Night Manager,"" when I compared it to episode 1 of ""The Night Agent,"" but I am certain something will show up in future episodes.There also seems to be a little bit of ""The Good Shepherd (2006)"" thrown in for good measure.Finally, you should know that even the ""exciting"" scenes of this first episode are plodding, dull, and boring. I made it halfway through episode 3 before I fast-forwarded through the remaining episodes. The story at the end is just as boring as the beginning of the series was.This series is simply a bad take on a classic genre. Be sure to avoid it if you are an espionage thriller buff.Bad! OH SO BAD!",1
"I didn't know this was based on a novel by Matthew Quirk starting it so I wouldn't know if this was a great adaptation.I liked it still. Not perfect by any means. It's your typical political thriller drama with twists and turns. Nothing new, you can say maybe cliche too certainly not something to win awards with but if you're into that genre I'd say give it a go? It was a surprisingly smooth ride. Kinda exciting. Had some good tension and action. Nothing too over the top. The characters didn't pop out as overly annoying or too gary/mary sue type. There's several povs that they focus on aside from Peter and Rose that I thought connected well so it doesn't feel too one sided.I like Peter and Rose. Rose I thought was going to be damsel in distress but thank god she's not. She earns her weight. Peter giving Owen vibes from The Recruit (another Netflix show starring Noah Centineo). Let's just say he can do his job well but sometimes you question some of his more hinky choices haha though perhaps less charming compared to Owen. The actor feels more like Gerard Butler movies saving his country type guy. My favorite characters are Dale and Ellen. I love unhinged characters. The other characters are good they have more going for them that just one off tropes.The vibe of the show I'd say is more similar to Bodyguard (the one starring Richard Madden). It's not as playful as The Recruit was. Anyway overall I thought it was a good watch!",8
"Good production value but that's it. The dialog, oh my, is so bad, so dumb it makes my head hurt. Script in general must be garbage since all the characters are one dimensional and full of overused dumb tropes. I honestly don't think any actor can work a bad script like this.I was really annoyed with a rescued princess type that has a problem with the world or anyone trying to save her. What a horrendous trope.But that's nothing. Only a second episode in and a bunch of unbelievable/ lazy things are happening like chatting with someone on the White House emergency phone and holding up the line. No problem, that's just the same phone you called the night before to save your life, why allow the same opportunity to someone else.Saying you can't lock the door behind you while an assassin is chasing you and there is clearly a basic latch shown... etc.I think I'm gonna quit now, I gave it a fair try.",5
"I almost had high expectations about this but boy I was disappointed.The main story is not that bad, it is cliche but I don't mind this. A lot of shows or movies have cliche stories but if they are well written the outcome is great. That's not the case with The Night Agent.The script is mediocre at best, the characters are badly written, there is no chemistry between them and the bad guys are almost laughable.The acting is also very weak especialy from Gabriel Basso. He looks like he doesn't belong there (among other things).Luciane Buchanan is doing a little bit better.It has a good pace, I give them that and the fighting scenes are not bad but these are the only reasons I don't give this show an even lower rating.",5
"Will anybody be left alive after a couple of episodes? If people working for secret services were killed that often, there would be no secret services. Why is it necessary to have so much pointless violence in movies? Because the screenplay writers can't think of any other events? Because young audiences adore violent scenes? What a disappointment, both for those who like good movies (and good plots) and those who know anything about secret service organizations. I gave up after the first episode, as it is clear that it will be nothing but repetition. Death as the main attraction? Truly a pity...",1
"All the hate in these reviews!! Why? Let me tell you, people don't watch tv for just entertainment and the thrill of the chase nor the step by step uncovering of the truth; they watch to criticize actors and decisions of writers. I love a conspiracy thriller series and Netflix provided just that in this show.Also if I watch something and don't like it - then I don't like it but I don't put it on blast and turn other people against it just because it wasn't my cup of tea. These type of reactions to shows are the reason so much hate exists in the world.The show was good! I really enjoyed it! Watch it if you love a good government conspiracy!!",10
"IF you love bad acting, then this series is for you. IF you want stupid dialogue, the this series is for you. IF you want to paint the FBI with a bad brush, then this series is for you. This is just painful to watch... If you don't believe me, give it a try! Try watching the train bombing and not picture bad acting. Try watching the night at the aunts and uncles and not picture extremely bad acting. I don't know about you, but if I just saw my aunt and uncle assassinated, I would be traumatized and devastated but the niece's acting is so bad it was ""just another night out""... Try to picture the car chase and not think of bad acting. The dialogue is beyond painful and the characters have no ""realism"" or ""chemistry"" to them at all. Whoever wrote this and screened the actors needs to find another line of work... BAD BAD BAD.",4
"Its probably pretty difficult to make a movie/show about the contemporary FBI/CIA or any government agency in a positive light and not have it be a complete farce, but it's like the writers didn't even try. The acting by the leads is a little better than par for the writing, which is absolute hot garbage. That being said, even certain deliveries of average script were off, and as others mentioned, there is absolutely no chemistry between characters/actors. The overall tone of the show is so flat and predictable, and there is no denouement from the non-stop basic and somehow boring action sequences.Characters are so static, not just depth wise but emotionally. Like every situation regardless of someone dying is just this artificially tense dialogue and acting.",1
"With that said.. Was it a masterpiece? Something you'd see on the big screen or Oscar-worthy? Probably not.It's full of clichés & other typical formulas,that would be found in similar television shows or movies.From a female perspective.. It does keep your attention,did watch all ten episodes in a day.Acting to actors chosen & cinematography,was decent enough.Is this worth watching? Sure. Not certain it would be something to rewatch,like other series.On a final note,again.. Why bad reviews? It didn't seem low-quality or budget and had many known actors,action & dialog wasn't deplorable.Give it a chance before,deciding off reviews alone.",6
"Ok so what's up what all these negative reviews, let me tell i just finished watching all 10 episodes (50 min each) and thought to just check the rating but oh boy people are just giving very negative opinion here. It's same as Netflix recent series ""THE RECRUIT"". I have watched that one too and i loved that too.Yes, I agree that the story is little bit stretched all that happening in one go but for people who love spy-thriller conspiracy type TV -Shows will 100% love it. It's exciting, easy to follow and concise.Talking bout acting department loved that as well. All the actors from did their best especially gabriel basso Loved it so farTo summarise in one word IF U HAVE ENOUGHT TIME (10 HOURS+) U CAN AND SHOULD DEFINATELY CHECK IT OUT , WORTH THE TIME OTHERWISE U CAN SKIP IT.Have a lovely weekend to anyone reading this.",9
"I was immediately interested in the first episode. It has murders, chase scenes and excitement from start to finish. That spilled over to the 2nd episode. But then by episode 3 it got dull and boring. Too much backstory. However it got fairly good again towards the climax in episodes 9 and 10. Although the premise that the vice president, chief of staff, head of secret service, and several others were involved in a conspiracy to kill a world leader along with the president at camp david seemed implausible. Also the vice president willing to let his daughter die in an explosion also seemed insane. I think if this had been 5 or 6 episodes instead of 10 then it would have been more entertaining and kept its fast pace. Otherwise it was a poor copy of ""24"".",6
"Like many have complained, the acting is not great on this show and the lack of chemistry is apparent. Might have more to do with the script than the actors themselves. Who knows....but the story isn't very good either.Netflix doesn't know how to make compelling, strong female characters. They seem to make the female characters, annoying, toxic and controlling. And at the same time trying to portrait men weak.The Night Agent, Gabriel Basso, is a SIMP. He is supposed to be working at the White House, but he is only about satisfying every whim of Rose Larkin. Who is annoying and entitled ""victim"" who shows barely any emotion even after her Aunt and Uncle were murdered. She believes she is more capable than FBI to solve the case.It's very hard to say anything good about this show. Well, D. B. Woodside did some solid work.",2
"This series is filled with cliches and amateur style acting. It's the kind of acting you'd expect from a 1970s porn movie. Some of the emotional outbursts of the characters make no sense at all, and it's almost comical how quickly these characters can randomly show up to respond to calls or take care of incidents. It's like they're all flying in space ships or warping around inside the show.I didn't really choose to watch this one, the wife found it on Netflix and I sat idly by half paying attention to it. Couldn't help but laugh at some of the scenes and cliched one-liners that you thought would've died during the disco era.",4
"Watched because had some time and seen most other highly rated shows. Pleasant surprise. Liked the cast, not Oscar worthy performances but good for this kind of show. The lead actors both were very good. Nothing new but nevertheless a good fast paced spy thriller. Plenty of action but not excessive. The plot unravels at a steady pace and Kept me engaged and binge watched over 2 days. Some background on all characters. Some posturing and subtle references to so called woke commentaries. Have not seen most of the actors in the show before. Watched this with an open mind. Overall I loved this show.",9
"Cliche plot, quite predictable; no chemistry between actors and writing is not exactly the best.The acting falls short sometimes, however there are a few moments where you almost connect with the leads.On the other hand, it will keep you entertained for what it is; a TV show about Agencies that you can watch when there's nothing else on.Remember why you're watching shows; to pass time and unplug, relax and have a good time. In that case, it will do the job if you get into it without any expectations. This is definitely not art, this is not pure garbage either.Not great, not bad, just above average.6 out of 10.",6
"Started out great and then it went downhill real fast. The acting is not bad... but if the story is problematic... what can the actors do? There is an overkill of action for no reason and the script is farfetched The characters are badly written and the bad guys are unbelievable and that is putting it nicely.It's not like they didn't spend money money on this thing... the sets are nice and the overall production is first cabin. To me it seems like they thought they needed to put way more action than clarity... which fell to the wayside. Like another persons' intro... ""Bad writing ruins everything"".",5
"This TV series is surprisingly very good. My husband loves suspense spy thrillers and he could not stop watching. Yes, we binged watched the series! From the first episode, it hooks the viewer in. As more information is revealed the series captured our interest even more. It was a pleasure to watch Hong Chau as well, who is amazingly talented from The Whale and Poker Face! Love that Hong Chau is in this series as well! Will there be a 2nd season? I certainly hope so!! Great series! The rest of the actors were very good as well, and there are some familiar faces. I hope that some of the current cast will appear if there is a 2nd season.",10
"Well written story, captivating and interesting from start to finish. Yes some episodes did get boring and lacked creativity, was very predictable and felt stretched out but it was mostly entertaining with well held suspense. Sutherland is a brilliant actor and they couldn't have chose a better person for his role, the other actors were also great. The backstory was good but I felt it was too focused on it at times, the ending was okay. It had the perfect amount of action, emotion and chase scenes. I rate it a solid 10, everything about this series was so good that I binge watched the whole 10 episodes. Some lines could have be written better or not been used amongst other characters but overall pretty good. Check it out for sure!",10
"I have to say, to give some series on Netflix a 10/10 is just not what I normally do. (My IMDB account got deleted...)This is not only an outstanding story, but the acting is spot-on. The main actors in this, although unknown to me but for the guy from the terminator, are professional and very slick! Everything looks and feel natural. The writing is just so good and although I am only halfway through, had to be commended on the excellent style!I was very surprised to have such high entertainment in a series. This could have been a top-notch movie, if Netflix decided to go the ""silver-screen"" route, instead they give us an 'on-your-edge-of-your-seat' whodunnit masterpiece I know will stand the test of time.Excellent job to Netflix and all the actors!",10
"That 'The Night Agent' (limp title, by the way) was taken from a novel is apparent from the way that the story flows, in a largely time-linear fashion, with few and only brief explanatory flashbacks. Furthermore, there is a continuity to the plot, rather than an episodic tone, which too often happens in stories told in a series, with individuals appearing one week that you sense are going to make a small but telling contribution before being killed off before the credits to that portion of the story roll.Our unlikely pair of heroes - or 'star-crossed lovers', if you care to see them in a Romeo and Juliet context - are brought together when a married couple of secret agents are accidently overheard by their niece, Rose, discussing something of significant 'national importance' before being wiped out by a pair of professional hitpersons. Before dying, they provide Rose with a secret telephone number answered by an FBI agent, Peter, located (for some unexplained reason) in a windowless office in the bowels of the White House.As all of this takes place in the first half of Chapter One, I do not feel that it is giving too much away of the plot by explaining this unlikely connection. Suffice to say, the story evolves over ten chapters to a conclusion which may be seen as a somewhat far-fetched 'tangled web we weave', but not impossible, involving the usual motivations of a lust for power and a greed for money. Peter and Rose (maybe, with names like that, I should have likened them to a fairy tale rather than Shakespeare's lovers!) are the central characters in the story and they play their roles competently and credibly; Peter (Gabriel Basso) is somewhat wooden and one-dimensional, but that may suit the impassive nature of his character, whilst Rose starts off as the stereotypical 'helpless heroine', but eventually reveals a tough and resourceful core. There is little 'chemistry' between Peter and Rose, but there would not necessarily be any, as he was just doing his job and she was trying to cope with the sudden deaths of her aunt and uncle, the only remaining members of her family at the start of the film.The leads are surrounded by a decent cast, including the two hitpersons, various colleagues and friends of Peter and, eventually, the most powerful person in the world, namely POTUS. One of the characters, a short and feisty female senior member of the White House staff, reminded me a great deal of the character in 'Veep' played by Julia Louis-Dreyfus, in that she seemed incapable of completing a sentence with 'dropping the F-bomb' in it! Unusually, at times we see the story through the eyes of the hitpersons, who are revealed not as 'faceless goons' but as individuals simply trying to do a job - however unpleasant and illegal - and get through life.There is the usual allocation of people hitting, and being hit by, other people, shooting at, and being shot at by, other people and car chases, but these moments are never excessive, disproportionate or irrelevant to the plot. Like peeling away the layers of an onion, the story becomes revealed in a stepwise fashion in a way that never seems illogical or ridiculous. The pacing of the development of the story is slow at times, but without ever becoming tedious.Whilst I am sure that there are a thousand and one reasons why what takes place could never happen in reality, at no time did I feel that the actions of individuals were out of context with their roles and personalities and nothing stood out, for me, as impossible or incongruous. This was a well-made, entertaining and gripping tale which I would recommend to anyone with the interest and concentration to follow a story from a small, insignificant beginning to a powerful, albeit unlikely, climax.8 out of 10 stars.",8
"What is it with the vocal fry with female actors? So much croaking it's driving me nuts. A good show spoiled by poor side plots. How is it there are eagle eyed conspiracy theorist sitting outside the very building our main protagonist parks. From across the road they seem to be less interested in their food but more interested in looking at random strangers in case they are wanted killers. Please !!And did I mention the exaggerated croaky voiced females who seem to think that putting on a strange voice is somehow clever, sexy or attractive? And I'm also wondering how it is that I need to write so many words in this review.",6
One of the better shows Netflix has produced. It has good thrills and better plot twists that you don't see coming. The acting in my opinion was on point. And a female lead who is not overly ambitious or powerful but not afraid to get her hands dirty along with a male lead who isn't like a normal action star and always handly beats the bad guys. If Netflix can stick to this formula I think they'll have a good success for future seasons and shows. Hoping for a second season.the chemistry between the two is pretty great too. Overall a very good watch and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes espionage thrillers.,10
"Couldn't make it it through two episodes before turning it off. From the lack of police support when he sees the bomber after the train incident, to the immediate swap of killer to cop during the search for the girl hiding in the closet, and the fact that she didn't want to tell the FBI that she saw the killer in case they were in on it (the killer already saw her see him, so the bad guys know anyway).The acting and characters are very bland except for the bad guys, but not enough to carry the show IMO.Watch ""The Recruit"" (same genre) to see how good acting and a smart writing can make a difference...",3
"Despite the low budget feel to this series, it percolates at an even keel but always aims forward. I was drawn in and binged it to the end. The action is well choreographed, the pace accelerating with each episode. The many plot points kept me intrigued; as each layer is uncovered, the intensity grows.That is not to say this is perfect. Far from it. Despite the interesting plot, holes as big as the Grand Canyon make for some forehead-slapping moments. The dialog is colorless, derivative and cheap. The soap opera elements bog down some of the middle episodes but I'm glad I stuck with it. The pacing and action are worth it and the two main characters are appealing.",8
"I can't understand some of these reviews here on this show. I started it yesterday and it has gripped me from the first moment. It's going very interesting and I'm on episode 2. Can't wait for more.I interrupted my work just to see what's next. How can people say such bad things about this? If you're looking for drama and excitement, then it's here. Someone even said there's no chemistry with the lead stars. What? Something is wrong with you hopeful critics.Please don't listen to them. Watch the show for yourself. I remember when Red Riding Hood with Amanda Seyfrield came out, and I went to the cinema to see it. I loved it and raced home to do a review. I was shocked by the negative reviews. It was then that I determined never to follow other people's reviews but to watch a show for myself.I read these reviews before I started The Night Agent and I'm glad I ignored those reviews because I am enjoying the show immensely. Will do another review when I finish it.",7
"This is not just predictable it is about as painful as an 8 hour episode of CSI if one were to be made. Absolute cardboard action, acting, set design, characters and dialogue. I am wondering who is writing these 10 reviews because this is actually worse than Reacher to be honest.I guess this is hitting the target market for people who have a hard time with anything other than your most basic regular crime, spy or political thrillers or perhaps the readers of sun par books on holiday.If you like, that's fine, I personally would rather paint dry than be able to ad lib better lines and imagine a real story that could have happened. Netflix is really scraping the bottom of the barrel lately and this is a perfect example.",4
"I don't Understand all the negative reviews. This is the best action series i have seen lately. It's captivating (watched it in 1 day), interesting plot twist. None stop action and suspense will keep you glued to the screen. Sure there are many things that seem unrealistic/unbelievable but who cares. It's not supposed to be factually accurate. Most action movies packed with unrealistic things. Sure it's not Oscar worthy but it's not 1/10. So to counter some of super low ratings I'm giving it 10. I enjoyed It and i think many people will too. Hope there is part 2 and hope it's as good as this one.",10
"One year after thwarting a terrorist attack on the Washington D. C. metro, FBI Agent Peter Sutherland (Gabriel Basso) works in the basement of the White House monitoring an emergency phone line that never rings for a intelligence program called Night Action jointly reporting to the FBI, and the President's Chief of Staff, Diane Farr (Hong Chau) who got him the position despite Sutherland's history of having a father who allegedly turned traitor that has made Peter a popular target for conspiracy theorist. When cybersecurity specialist Rose Larkin (Luciane Buchanan) moves back with her aunt and uncle following the collapse of her startup, her first night she hears them discussing urgent matters in hushed whispers before their home is attacked by two assassins (Eve Harlow and Phoenix Raei). Before her aunt and uncle are killed they give Rose a phone number with a code phrase they tell her to call along with the words ""Osprey was right"". Retreating to the neighboring house, Rose calls the number which puts her in contact with Peter who helps her stay alive during pursuit until the police arrive. As Peter takes over Rose's protection, the two are thrown into a wide reaching conspiracy that reaches all the way to the highest echelons of power.The Night Agent is an adaptation of the 2019 novel of the same name by Matthew Quirk and began development in 2020 under the stewardship of noted TV writer/producer Shawn Ryan. The show was picked up by Netflix and has recently debuted on the streamer and I'm happy to say it's an engrossing and thrilling 10 episodes of television.From the opening metro bombing where we're first introduced to Peter Sutherland, the series immediately gets you hooked as it jumps to one year later and the unexplained bombing has been co-opted by liars and conspiracy theorists who try to smear Peter as complicit in the bombing rather than a hero. The show does a solid job establishing the high stakes of the series while also creating both Peter Sutherland and Rose Larkin as likable and engaging characters who you want to see put together the pieces. Gabriel Basso gives a really good performance as Peter and having been a fan of this actor since his days playing Adam Jamison on The Big C, it's nice to see he's developed into a capable leading man with a relaxed masculine charisma that gives him the same level of appeal Robert Redford had in Three Days of the Condor. Luciane Buchanan is equally good as Basso's co-lead sporting a sense of humor and spunky self-assuredness that makes her skillset complimentary to Peter's with both characters getting equal chances to shine.The show also features some solid supporting performances with Fola Evans-Akingbola very good and charismatic as young but determined Secret Service agent who is paired with a welcome appearance by Lucifer and 24 alum D. B. Woodside as a more seasoned but damaged veteran. But most prominently we have Hong Chau who is very good as Diane Farr who gets to play with the conflicted nature of her character. Chau is quickly becoming one of those actresses I look forward to seeing having loved her appearance in 2019's Driveways and continuing her strong run with notable appearances in The Menu and The Whale in 2022, and I'm pleased to say Chau is no less good here.The plot covers most of the major beats you know from this type of conspiracy thriller and if you've seen the British series Bodyguard or the movie Three Days of the Condor you'll have a pretty good idea of the plot beats that are struck in terms of what kind of story this is. However, just because this is well trodden ground don't mistake that for a lack of quality because you don't always need to be original but you should always need to be engaging and the movie does a good job of that. While The Night Agent takes itself seriously (in comparison to the more dramedy inclined The Recruit), it does take pauses for exchanges between our cast as well as moments of genuine humor that give the show a bit more personality than you'd probably expect upon first seeing it. This even comes down to the assassins played by Eve Harlow and Phoenix Rael (whose characters I don't believe are named in the series) as they have this quirky romantic relationship that's showcased in between the chases and shootouts. As with many conspiracy shows there are the occasional bits that do stretch disbelief, but for the most part the central mystery was keeping me engaged especially when it was complimented with engaging characters and performances.I really enjoyed The Night Agent and think it's a solid 10 episodes of TV. The central mystery has a great hook and a pair of likable characters, there's a strong feeling of tension and paranoia during the investigation, and there's not a bad performance from the bunch. While the show does leave the door open to continuation, I'm pleased to say the series is mostly self-contained and doesn't brazenly ""season bait"" so if there is a second helping of The Night Agent I'll gladly take it if it can be kept to the same level.",8
"It's probably too soon to judge this series for me since I've only watched the 1st Episode but I can't ignore how badly it was written from point of security. The agent talks on the speaker phone in front of this woman whom he just met/ saved. He gives out all secret Svc info such as the code name for the operation. Every time she asked a question he give out too much info like "" this is an abnb belong on a friend of mine's acct!! I may like the show later on simply for being an action show but seems like writers had no clue how the secret Svc/fbi operates! I was surprised that he didn't ask her for the pic of paper that she used to call him immediately after they met!",3
"If you like the first two episodes and see absolutely nothing wrong with them, then keep watching and you will enjoy.If you watch the first two episodes and started having questions about the writing, acting, ex machina, lack of coherence....then stop now and save your self the trouble....it does not get better.1.

I too like other reviewers had high hopes for this one. We were looking forward to an exciting action packed series and I genuinely thought it might be another version of 24 but then the F words started. We watched two episodes and had to stop. As is so obvious and prolific in modern shows - the degeneration in script writing standards unfortunately continues with the unnecessary use of bad language that adds nothing to the story. The plotline has so many elements from other shows but as to what happens after the second episode we'll never know. I hope someone will make a good series soon without the unnecessary bad language or sexual content.,5
"I thoroughly enjoyed the entirety of this fast-paced, sometimes comical, always intriguing and wee bit romantic saga. There were no few ""F-Bombs"", but apart from that I was so happy to see there was a minimum of gore and gratuitous sexuality. .Few of us are naive enough to think the government is all truth and noble pursuit. Thus even the story line had a ring of truth to it. I found myself cheering when the bad guys were thwarted and scratching my head when some new twist begged for an explanation.All in all, it is one of the better series I've seen in a long time. Please tell us Seasons 2, 3 + are on their way.",10
"I don't even know where to start. You know that feeling when somebody tells you a lie and it's so obvious that you don't know if you should be mad because they're lying to you, or because they take you for a moron? That's the feeling you get when watching this show. It's so awfully stupid and lazy.A simple example; if the VP's daughter get shot in the leg she probably won't be moving around limping for the next few days. No crutches, no wheelchair.People don't say ""we have digital copies"" when they talk about files on a digital camera.These are just two of many examples throughout the show. Every episode again. Watching these kind of shows makes me wonder what it actually takes to become a writer for TV. And do they watch the result and think that they did a good job? Because to me it seems that they got bored after episode two and decided to cut corners wherever possible just to be done with it.",4
"I must say I never thought Night Agent would be this good. I was expecting more drama at the white house and some few killings here and there. To my surprise it's a lot more than that. It's very thrilling and gripping action mystery to be solve throughout the entire season. Everytime one episode ends it's creating this urge or temping me to want the next and so forth 'till I realized it's already 6am in the morning. I was darn hooked to it I never realized it's already sunrise. I never had this same feeling since 24 tv series on the same genre. Not as the same hard gritty action as 24 but the story, suspense, thrills and pacing almost the same. I totally enjoyed this one. Too bad Season 2 seems unlikely at this point but if they do I hope they maintain same level of formula as season 1 or even better.",10
"It is a Well paced thriller keep you hook from the first episode. The pace of the continues from episode to episode but it never loose the pace. Instead it gets better as it reaches the final episodes and very well enjoyable finale episode to fish the show. Reasonable action scenes and gripping story. Finally Netflix made an action drama series which has standards to meet the likes of Amazon Prime. Another great show which is based on the bestselling novel which never fail to entertain the viewers. Avoid the negative reviews and tune into get entertained with roller coaster ride of action, thrill and fun.",9
"A great show! Gripping development of plot, likeable lead characters, nice action and suspense. Of course as with practically all shows of this style there are some far-fetched moments, but at the end of the day it is entertainment, not a documentary. It is fun to watch and keeps your interest.I do wish writers would stop having all characters use the f-word all the time, but this is common in contemporary shows. To me it is just lazy writing. Intelligent, professional people speak accordingly. Nonetheless, this fault doesn't detract too much- we binge watched the entire first season and look forward to another!",8
"I was hoping for a good new action series, with some of the actors listed it was promising, Liked the 2 first episodes, but after that the quality of the story loses it, as it was a collection of plots from other movies/series. Many of the scenes became confusing /disconnect and there are big gaps in the story and it seems to been cut down, and that very poorly, it must be the explanation for the sloppy storytelling . And on top of that the female actors are overdoing the cool, tough and rude attitude. Worst is probably the way the plot changes locations back and forth almost like the entire story is taking place in the same block. Be prepared to be disappointed.",1
"Is this the most well-written or well-acted show on TV? Absolutely not. Was it fun & action-packed? Absolutely! Gave me '24' vibes...sometimes we just want to be entertained and go along for the ride; this ticked those boxes for me, and I would love to see another series, felt like they were setting up for one at the end! Enjoyed the relationship between Peter & Rose too, look forward to seeing it develop. I do think the show needs to decide if it's going for the 'young adult' audience or wants to go full on 18+, it seemed to hover between the two, so I think they need to commit to one or the other. 8/10.",8
"The first four episodes were entertaining enough. The subsequent episodes became cluttered with a plot full of holes, multiple minor characters, and too many twists. Ten episodes was way too long to carry the story. The major characters were developed unevenly. Can we get a series where modern people don't have family/daddy issues? Is America headed in the wrong direction because of bad parenting? I like the two evil villains and wish they could have their own Killing Eve type show. Psycho hit lady was actually the best character. Her boyfriend was a close second.I made it through all ten long episodes in spite of the overly complicated plot and awful music. Back to watching reruns of Dr Who til spring returns.",5
"The White House has a bat phone manned by our policeman hero. He is a hero because at the start he saves a train full of people and is good with kids. He has to answer a phone that hasn't been used as far as he is aware. The phone it turns out; is for when foreign spies who have flipped and started working for the good guys get in trouble. That is to say if you were spying on America and they catch you but you want to work for America and not go to a dark hole forever then you are obviously going to need someone in counter-intelligence who doesn't know anything about you or your circumstances, who has to look up stuff in a binder for when you find yourself in trouble you call the White House. Honestly it really makes more sense this way. If I say it more clearly it makes absolutely no sense at all. So when things are at their worst for the hapless foreign spy ""Night Action"" protocol can be invoked by those with the number and codewords. If you can access this shadow state you get through to a guy in a windowless office who doesn't even have a computer because stuff is so secret and has to ring other people to ask them to do stuff for him whilst looking at busy work for a year. In a windowless office in the White House. He has to physically go there in order to answer the phone and then call other people on the phone without leaving the office. He is highly trained for this role by the FBI but recently got head hunted into Night Action jointly run by the FBI and the White House Chief of Staff for call handling and sensory deprivation. I'm not sure how bad the budgetary problems are in the Federal Government but you have a highly trained operative on call handling duty. To be fair he is being shared by the FBI and WHCoS so that's a positive. Does he need to be in the White House though? Is anyone going to go and speak to him in person?If all of this is starting to sound a little implausible then perhaps the entire thing is an elaborate joke being played on hero cop. It may have started as a cherished office tradition that escaped the ban on hazing? New inductees were told about ""the Night Action"" in hushed tones. Each new member was introduced to ""the phone"" with a sense of reverence and left alone to begin their vigil. All other previous candidates got up and left after 12 minutes, nobody in the office had our hero pegged for 12 months. The joke had obviously got out of hand and perhaps sensing that the hero is about to snap, the WHCoS assures hero cop that in fact it all hasn't been a colossal waste of time and talent but instead; for ""the last 12 months I've been training you for something I wasn't sure what for."" We reach the apparent climax of the show right here: it turns out this wasn't just a prank gone on far too long but this was in fact the final test. All the other candidates had proved their good judgement and common sense so were useless to the President. Given the vague and meaningless explanation for the horror he had endured in the box ""for something I wasn't sure what"" our hero stands firm. Rather than scream with frustration at his wasted sanity our hero proves he is a ""good soldier"" and ""ready to do whatever it takes"". This is said in whilst stood in front of the star spangled banner. We have entered Executive Death Mode. In episode 3 he builds the death star. Research and all the other stuff spy stuff was actually happening back at the real office (which resembles every generic NCNCIS set). It is staffed by a great bunch of guys. A really terrific group of hard working behind-the-scenes characters. They will generate a great deal of generic, genial but also sometimes, really genuinely touching and heartfelt subplot.The algorithm has decided this is what we deserve so what are you going to do about it?",3
"I cannot understand some of these poor reviews and.quasi-esoteric complaints about poor writing. I found it to be compelling and watched back-to-back episodes.In contrast to quite a bit of Netflix offerings, this series had a good story line developed over 10 episodes and ended very well, and to that it left it open for a sequel. I would be the first on board to watch a part two series for certain.Bosso and Buchanan did very well as the two main protaginosts. Their performances were quite believable for the desperate situations they found themselves in. Fola Evans-Akingbola and D. B. Woodside were very welcome in supporting roles.",10
"However, all of the actors involved tried. I am glad all of them found work. So I score it a 2. The rest is terrible. Stiff and bored performances barely prop up the worst script. Cheap foreshadowing. 'We are such good friends.' Guess who gets it next? I feel this would never have been filmed without the casting of Hong Chau. Honestly, I feel like I got punked to watch this. It seems like all the actors are reading the weather. Blah, blah blah. Hate to provide a negative review, as I know the no name cast did what they could. The premise of the story is so dumb. Imagine there are several high level government officials in on trying to take over the government I guess. I guess because it is too dumb to even believe that the story was created.Watch the Recruit. At least there are some laughs.",2
"THE ONLY CHARACTER I DIDN'T LIKE WAS ROSE.THEY MADE HER INTO AN ANNOYING PETULENTTEENAGER WHEN WE KNOW SHE IS AN ADULT FROM THEBEGINNING FROM THE CONVERSTION WITH HER AUNTAND UNCLE.SHE IS ADVERSARIAL IN ALL DIALOGUE AND IT ISTIRESOME, BUT THE STORY MAKES UP FOR THEAGGRIVATION. THE AGENT ACTOR BASSO WAS VERYGOOD AND NICE TO SEE ROBERT AGAIN.REVIEWS IS ASKING FOR 200 MORE CHARACTERS BEFOREPOSTING A COMMENT. SO HERE IS THE SYNOPSIS:
The Night Agent is a sophisticated, character-based, action-thriller centering on a low-level FBI agent who works in the basement of the White House, manning a phone that never rings -- until the night that it does, propelling him into a fast moving and dangerous conspiracy that ultimately leads all the way to the Oval Office.",7
"Mostly because of the two leads but a great supplemental cast especially the Asian agent. The first ep had non stop action. The rest slow down as they begin unraveling the huge conspiracy. Terrific show that yes is not too original but then what is these days. Reminiscent of the recent The Recruit, Condor and The Bodyguard but that's ok because those were all good shows also. Only halfway through and it's definite binge watchable. The two aforementioned leads are very likable and the show excels when they're working together. Ignore the whiny complainers who literally hate everything, probably including themselves.",10
"There is an interesting premise here reminiscent of Jack Ryan type spycraft and conspiracy thrillers, but the characters do not act like the people they are supposed to be.FBI agents apparently have no training in firearms, hand to hand combat, or evasive driving techniques. They also have no protocols for any scenarios, and their safe house procedures are a joke . They talk to one another like a pack of school bullies.Worse, the witness seems to have a better idea how to protect herself and investigate who is behind the conspiracy than the people charged with protecting her.I think the writers performed their research by watching bad network cop and FBI shows. Regardless, common sense should have kicked in to give some semblance of proper procedure.There are also odd subplots that don't add anything to the primary plot but keep appearing to slow down the progression. In particular the assassin's who prove to be complete sociopaths yet the show keeps trying to force us to relate to and feel sorry for them. Weird.Even so there's enough to here to watch, even if the end wraps up in familiar fashion.",6
"Only thing I could not get over of this amazing, wanna be, Netflix version of ""Jack Reacher"". Is that the lead character is honestly the love child of Chris Pine and Connor McDavid from the Edmonton Oilers hockey team. Seriously look at him! Normally would not post a love child that is not solely movie/tv. But.... k well now I have to type in at least another 200 hundred characters. But if you put the two picks of McDavid/Pine, you'd see that I'm spot on. Show honestly deserves the binge though, great acting, great story line, even got T1000 playing a cop again. Brilliant. It would have been a ten out of ten if I wasn't stuck in this Chris Pine and Connor McDavid love child thing... it's distracting as hell.",8
"If you think MCU is peak cinema you'll probably enjoy this mediocre garbage. Terrible acting, unconvincing action, every scene so improbable it left me asking ""seriously?"".Can netflix please cast a strong female lead who isn't insufferable? Having a bored, irritated and stubborn female lead is one thing (objectively awful) but to pair her with a doofy agent who is obsessed with her (for some reason) is truly agonizing. The worst part is there is zero chemistry and it just adds to the totality of everything in this show falling flat. The ""zinger"" one liners in this are so utterly cringeworthy. Just truly terrible.I love government agency shows but this was an abomination. I'd rather rewatch The Americans.",1
"The Night Agent formula: the mix of Mission Impossible, 24, Patriot Games, and all those famous threats to US President combined into 1 TV series called The Night Agent.The good news is it is entertaining and a great choice to relax with a bowl of popcorn.The bad news is, there are not much of opportunities for every actor in this series to develop their characters. The series is very fast paced and leave very, very few seconds for an actor to show their acting prowess. This formula was successfully develop by 24 but The Night Agent only has 10 episodes to introduce the main characters, so they kept the main characters focusing on 1-2 person on focus at any given time.Overall, if you are looking for a good entertainment to relax your tense brain and you like action films, watch The Night Agent, you'll get good action and fast paced story you usually enjoy in cinemas at TV screen.",7
"Oh, (groan), not another one of THOSE . ... and an entire SERIES, no less!! I suppose some would consider this a mid-range (ratings-wise) action movie to be viewed when in the mood for short doses of ANOTHER collection of the impossible and implausible situations. The worst is the character ROSE .... another mindless, clueless airhead who wanders through the piece as the maiden in distress, alternating hot and cold, ability-wise. Was this character written or designed the way she is? Is she a product of poor writing, or poor acting? Ditto for the super hero, indestructible, boy scout male lead .... a result of poor writing ability, or poor acting skills? I lean heavily toward serious problems in the writing and directing departments! Things only get worse as the series progresses. If you're looking for ""not to be taken seriously"" chunks of diversion, loaded with a lot of ""Are you kidding me?"" moments, look no further! This one is for you!",3
"TV screenplay that is on par with other highly watched series, and better than many ""made for cable"" mini-series. However, it tries to incorporate too many genres. The gratuitous video game violence may try to bring in males with arrested development who still live at home. But sadly, it is a poor excuse to deal with characters that the writers could not intriguingly integrate, and instead merely kill off. There is a bit of National Treasure meets espionage which is compelling. But the cat & mouse, fish out of water, spy genre is insufficiently focused -- to be a compelling thriller. There are plenty of teaser sub-plotlines which are dangled before the audience, but insufficiently developed, only to be ultimately tied together with little character and story development. Edit this series down, and it would be a good 2-part episode that feels like Dean Devlin's Leverage.The shining star is Hong Chau, who brilliantly plays over her age with gray hair (absolutely genius touch), but has beautiful hands. Her performance makes the illogical facts seem remotely plausible. Also an honorable mention to a rock solid performance by Gabrielle Rose, who was under utilized.Hint: If a writer is going to attempt an espionage / corruption screenplay, then they had better get their technological issues correct. Here, The Night Agent dismally fails by confabulating unrealistic technology excuses for lack of writing skill. E.g., discussing ""air gap"" security, then transmitting WiFi from within a faraday cage secure facility. And, switching SIM cards in the same ""burner"" phone, which remains trackable with the same IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity). Further, there is a running joke in Hollywood that deeply insults any person with an IQ above 120 that a SIM card must be destroyed to be untrackable. And if you passed spy training, you well know that you only need to wrap your cellphone in 3 layers of aluminum foil to block all RF (radio frequency) signals. Proof -- try it, and then have somebody try to call you. All the cellphone tracking myths used to compensate for poor writing skill, merely demonstrate the deficient status of contemporary education. And if you can't find aluminum foil in the kitchen, just put it inside a metal pot with metal lid. Fortunately in The Night Agent, they used the Subaru Forester 2nd Gen update, which does not come with any uplink (trackable, StarLink) system.",6
"The Night Agent starts off promising with its intriguing premise and cliché but entertaining storyline. However, It becomes difficult to support the female characters due to their excessive portrayal of a tough, cool, and rude demeanor, and one can't help but wish for the female lead to be killed by the killer.Furthermore, the portrayal of the secret service is disappointingly weak and ineffective, and the police are portrayed as stupid. The plot execution lacks depth, and the storylines and subplots are not well-developed.Overall, The Night Agent fails to deliver on its promise, and the weak execution and unsympathetic portrayal of its female characters make it a disappointing watch.",6
"Yes, there are plenty of clichés involved. Here's the thing, how many different ways could you possibly write a political action movie? Seriously? What, there's like maybe 4 different possible plots?1)The President, Vice President or their family is kidnapped.2)The President, Vice President or their family is in danger.3)The Vice President plots against the President.4)The extremists want to take over the country.Pretty sure that covers all of them. So yes, this will be similar to several movies and/or TV shows. There's no possible way around it when there's only so many possible plots to use. I binge watched all ten episodes and I enjoyed it from start to finish. Don't let these bad reviews about clichés chase you away without even giving it a try.",8
"Professional keelers which never hit on the first shot? Check
Bad guys which dress and pose, and put on an accent of bad guys? Check.Standard stupid car chase when no one hits no one, no fatalities or injuries of other drivers and bystanders when driving against traffic? Check.Counter intelligence seceret agents discuss confidential affairs when their niece is upstairs? Check
The fate of the nation is in a single hard drive? Check
The hot fbi agent set a breakfast date with the hot witnesses exactly at the time of the attempted hit on her? CheckAnd I watched only 2 episodes. .Nothing close to real spy movies of John la care.But I still watch it, so it has some entertainment in it.",1
"Every now and again it's good to watch a series where not a lot of thinking is required. The Night Agent doesn't require much thinking. It's harmless but not much substance. As a teacher it is reminiscent of something teenage boys would right. The storyline and language are both cliched and full of plot holes.Locked doors that seem to take big guys ages to push open. Guns with silencers. Obvious bad guys walking the streets of Washington in trench coats and guns strapped to the leg and an overzealous use of the ""f"" word.Probably the most irritating part of the show is the FBI boss who speaks like she is a robotic character from Futurama. She would also be the dumbest boss in any spy series.",6
"I rate the first three or four episodes 3 out 10 due to poor character development, unconvincing delivery and terribly written dialogue. In addition almost all the strong roles are women and the men, especially the lead, are emasculated. The young female lead, the neice, goes from being a cyber security expert civilian to playing a key role in all Secret Service and FBI activities in one episode. It was not able to suspent my disbelief past 30 minutes. If you're looking for examples of Hollywood desperately trying to advance womens' roles at the cost of forced acting bordering on laughable, this is it. There are some believable female roles, but the director/production decided to promote as many female roles as possible. Even if the acting is weak and the roles are not well cast. The most interesting characters are the assassins, especially the male who is killed off in the 8th episode. The overall story has good potential and shows complexity, and it's fairly well developed throughout the 10 episodes ending in a predictable conclusion. But there are so many instances of weak line delivery and poor writing you'll start yelling at the TV or grasping your head in disbelief. In the final 6 episodes the action increases and characters are knocked off raising the stakes and increasing tension, allowing you to take the focus off the weak points I mentioned and get into the developing story. I would rate the last three or four episodes 7.5, but the major weaknesses are still present. The series gets off to a very shaky unbelievable start and ends predictably. In the hands of an experienced director and screenwritten by a Breaking Bad writer this series could have easily been a 8.5+. Disappointing...",6
"I am always sceptical when yet another FBI/CIA/spy conspiracy show comes along. But I gave this one a try, and it got me in right from the start. I ended up watching all 10 episodes over 2 nights (which I never do) because, like a good book, I couldn't put it down.The producers didn't treat the viewer like and idiot and spoon feed the plot information to you. You actually had to work it out yourself.There were plenty of suspects and red herrings, some really good suspense, some decent acting, and no unnecessary blood and gore.A very good ""who done it"", then ""who done it to who"" and ""why would they do it"" suspensful action drama.Sure, there were plenty of clichés and plot holes, but you expect that with this type of show (FBI agents and professional hitmen who couldn't hit a barn door from 10yards...)
I'd certainly still recommend it if you like these type of shows.",9
"What is this really? The cyber security genius girl can do everything and anything! She fights trained assassins, she tells everyone what to do, she kills trained assassins, she does investigation better than experienced detectives, she talks down to everyone including the president, she acts and talks as everyone on this planet owes her something! I wouldn't have had any problems with any of this and could have just accepted her as bad cliche writing! However my biggest problem is that she is presented as the moral compass of the story, as a role model for young girls, as someone to look up to! And that just scares me!",3
"Gabriel Basso provides a solid performance as FBI agent Peter Sutherland. Basso has considerable depth and range. Moreover, his posture and physical affect are in perfect alignment with the various situations he finds himself in.Luciane Buchanan, on the other hand, who plays the niece of two covert FBI agents is stiff, monodimensional; over-the-top insufferable, and undeservedly entitled. She offers some range in the final episode so she is capable of nuance. Perhaps the flaw is with direction. There are five directors; each responsible for two episodes.The script and plot are a mess. There is misrepresentation over the various responsibilities of the NSA, FBI, Secret Service and CIA. Furthermore, a civilian is able to do things that no civilian would ever be permitted to do. Low-level FBI agents have direct contact with the president; something that would never happen in real life. For that matter, they also have direct contact with the White House Chief of Staff. That's never going to happen.Finally, real conspiracies have very few conspirators - the smallest number possible to achieve their goal. There are just too many unnecessary conspirators.The series IS entertaining. I watched all ten episodes. However, I note that the crew does not include a consultant; someone with government experience.The series is based on the book of the same name by Matthew Quirk. However, the plot of the book involves finding out who is a Russian mole in the White House which seems greatly more believable than this series' conspiracy theory. Presumably the book does a better job in the realm of who does what with whom in the White House.",6
"I'm on episode 3 and have got hooked on it. It's a great action and it keeps me going. I would definitely recommend to anyone whether you love action movies or not. It's also a good suspense that keeps you off your toes, like what's going to happen. It makes you wonder who you can trust and who they can't. You may think you figured it out but then there's someone else. The acting is good.I hope they have another season. Makes me wonder if each new season will be based off of another person in protective custody or if the plot will continue. Like I mention, I'm only on episode 3 so unsure how final episode will end.",10
"It has moments that give me hope, such as the charismatic co-leading Gabriel Basso. But too many amateur, shallow spots poke holes in those dreams.Someone storms out of a room to leave the conversation, and unexplainably comes back into the room asking what's going on. Non-sensical leaps to further the plot and it's only episode 2.The show lacks depth and nuance, opting instead to play on a potentially good plot with embarrassingly obvious and hyperbolic emotions I'd expect on a 3rd rate remake of Buffy.I'll watch one more episode to be sure as I'm only 1 in, but the lapses are too egregious to leave me feeling anything but insulted and disappointed.",3
"Maybe my user opinion and writing skills are no better than others, oK. But this is not a '7.5' rated production, unless you also think shows based on video games is a plot unto itself like the overrated ""the Last of Us"". This is supposed to be a high level conspiracy story, but there is no consipracy. Not even the conspirators know what side they are on the connections are so random. I am sorry writers and producers, there needs to be a conspiracy in a conspiracy story, not just a blank box to ""insert conspiracy here"". The Audience wants a few clues that hold up longer than the next shallow scene.",6
"This series is highly entertaining and a great watch. It is so nice to see a simple story, written beautifully, and acted so well. It is great to have Gabriel back in a series. He was fantastic as the son in The Big C with the fabulous Laura Linney. Now he leads this series and does a terrific job at it! It was great seeing a series that didn't spend 30 minutes with its setup, explaining how characters got where they were. This was taken care of quickly, basically through simple talk between characters. So welcome back Gabriel! Long may this fabulous series reign! I hope Netflix is listening to these positive comments.",10
"Same old, same old!! This had nothing different to offer than the hundreds of action films and series of its kind! It is characterised by many as a great espionage thriller series but I have to disagree. There are few plot holes here and there and the acting is just..decent, nothing special. Believe me, there aren't any surprises and no thrilling moments. I guess, it's an OK watch if you our out of any other options.If you are really looking for a remarkable series of this kind and still haven't watched it, search for "" The Americans "". Real suspense and superb acting. You will not be disappointed!",5
"If you have ever seen 24 or any of the CSI iterations, you've actually already seen this series and don't know it yet.There's really nothing original about it at all. You can easily predict every plot-line after the first episode. Just think ""what's the most cliche thing that can happen here?"" and that's exactly what will happen.The acting ranges from bad to mediocre. The writing, as mentioned above, is both predictable and infuriating.The only good thing about the entire show is that I'm happy to see Netflix try to make something that's geared toward adults. It's a swing and a miss IMO, but at least it's not another teen drama.",4
"One of the better conspiracy series in a long time. The story is well built up. Diffferent storylines comes together in just the right tempo. Action, dialogue and some light humor are in balance. Acting is maybe not perfect at al times from all actors, but surely above average. The only real weakness I experienced was the plot, which becomes clear in episode nine. I won't get into it, as I would give too much away. Let's just say that the final goal of the conspiracy could have been achieved in a more simple and rational way. At least that how I see it. The drama in the first episode seems totally unnecessary. Still have one episode to go when writing this review. Looking forward. All in all well done except for the less intelligent plot. Therefore only eight stars. Will be worth your while.",8
"From the screenplay to the plot, character building, and acting, it seems like the work of amateur filmmakers or, at best, a graduate project. The creators seem to be more interested in garnering public attention through poorly thought-out stunts rather than producing quality content. Moreover, they seem to have haphazardly utilized the ""popular"" concept of identity politics by having female heroes, leaders, and villains. However, they've failed to depict these characters with nuance or complexity, instead relying on the perspectives, thoughts, and voices of simplistic, action-craving men.As a result, the execution was lazy, uninspired, and typical of the male self-congratulatory attitude. It's apparent that the creators do not genuinely care about telling a story with deep and truthful female characters, but rather exploit the concept for their own benefit.Shocked that Netflix released such a low-quality TV production, which highlights the streaming industry's desperation and lack of taste.",2
"I have been looking for a new series to watch for a while. Started a few, didn't finish them. Had been looking for something similar to '24' and 'Person of Interest'. As 'The Night Agent' came out on Netflix, I gave it a shot and I found it entertaining. Spying, conspiracy, cliffhanger endings per episode, suspension, gun fights, moles in the whitehouse, technology. What more could you ask for?Usually with series' now a days, the episodes get tedious, it loses its appeal and you forget to watch the remaining episodes. Not with this show.Highly enjoyable and I hope Netflix decide to continue the show into further series'. Has a '24' element to it, reminded me of the British TV show 'Bodyguard' to begin with.My only gripe is the amount of unnecessary profanity in some of the episodes. But, that's the level of people's conversations these days..",9
"I watched the opening few minutes twice. You know that moment when you start watching a new programme on your own and then you think that your wife would enjoy it too? So you stop watching, and build it up to your beloved ... ""Darling, there's a new series starting Netflix it looks pretty good."" So you sit down to watch again from the beginning... suffice to say, of the first one and a half episodes, the first 3 or 4 minutes are really good and it goes steadily downhill from there. From the second half of the second episode onwards it might reach dizzying heights of dramatic excellence but sadly we'll never find out as we gave up. Cheap production values, writing and plotting have resulted in a sadly disappointing series. All of that said, I did like the gag with the wallets....",2
"The series is not bad but too long, eight episodes would have been more than enough. After the sixth episode I found it hard to stay in front of the TV. Basso's performance as the FBI agent is fine and solid, if a bit naive at times. However, the performance of Buchanan, who plays the niece of two FBI agents and a specialist in Silicon Valley security systems, is too flat. I don't know if it's because of the script, but her character completely devoid of any nuance or charisma. On the other hand, as a woman, it's good to see women in decision-making positions, but it would be better if the script didn't insist on a constant ""you man don't respect me because I'm a woman"", which ends up tiring and showing women as witches.",6
"Dear Netflix, Stop making a series out of everything. Sometimes a story can be told in a two-hour movie.It started out well and held my attention, unfortunately, by the fourth episode the story began to fall apart. There were too many bad guys, too many twists, too many implausible plots. By the fifth episode, I was scrolling through my phone.But the deeper the plot got, the less plausible the storyline became and the less off topic. Yes, I know it's a story, but it felt like different lines were stopping and starting and taking different paths just to lead to a very convoluted story. And the VP was willing to sacrifice his daughter? Politicians are slimy, but who knew?",5
"I got through episode 1 and that's more than enough for me. The script is rubbish, it's filled with cliche after cliche. They gather up all the most used film or TV cliched scenes - bomb, hero, deep cover agents, car chases, shooting, a mole...and it all involves the White House. Netflix is having problems keeping viewers, maybe they should look at what they're producing. Does anyone read scripts before approving productions? And the directing is really poor, the FBI isn't going to have two agents standing outside a house, they'd be in vehicles. They're not guards at Buckingham Palace.I liked Gabriel Basso and had no major problems with the cast, the problem was the dumb script.",3
Don't invest five minutes in the disgrace of a series. The dialogue is flat. Several of the actors seem like they are at a table reading. The storyline dries up pretty quick and the only thing you're left with is caricatures performances by stream Lee mediocre actors who have no business acting to be quite honest.Don't invest five minutes in the disgrace of a series.

"This show started out quite well. A bit of character back story and development. A plausible conspiracy. An initial event to intertwine our main characters. All of which was quite well acted by an ensemble of a less than well known cast.Then we quickly start taking short cuts in good story telling that make any reasonable viewer cringe. OK, our initial survivor in need of protection does have a high tech security business backstory so maybe just maybe she would have some serious hacking skills. Still doubtful she'd be able to penetrate the highest levels of US government security.The serious issues arise as our victim heroine also develops a serious desire to fight instead of flight. Something the entertainment industry seems to default to these days but is far less accurate in real life.Our dynamic duo continues to infiltrate and access high security locations literally within feet of the bad guys but make their escape every time.What started out promising devolved into stereotypical triteness unfortunately all to common in today's entertainment.",4
"As much as I want to give this a good score I can't. I loved the main actor because I saw him when he was younger. But I was laughing the whole time I was watching this. What is this guy doing that 911 operators can't do?! Other than get involved? He dispatches police vehicles and they take FOREVER!!! Then you get this ""high profile"" person to keep safe the caller? What was the point of this line? Then they're super aggressive towards the person they're supposed to be protecting. Like seriously? How is this good writing? I am still watching the show because I want to give it some time. But these are my criticisms so far.",4
"Main characters(Gabriel&Luciane) are so charming and attractive. Loved the details of killers as well.Peter(Gabriel) looked so naive and kind for an FBI agent, but that's what it makes this drama so special.You can see how warm and empathetic Peter is through his eyes. Great acting!I was not that bothered with the storylines by the way, because of those great actors made me feel like I was at the scene.It'll be great to have those agents like Peter in real life, who's trully worried about his proteges, as much as his nation, tasks, and orders.Some people may think the writing is not that unique or twisted enough from other spy thrillers.However, as a person who's tired from too much details and guessing game, I enjoyed the drama as it is.Simple yet Powerful enough to absorb its audiences.Really hope that there's season 2, of course having Gabriel in it.????",10
"I'm not sure what I expected when I started watching this. I wanted something that was interesting. Sadly, this was not it. The plot is not anything new. The actors are not bad, the series actually has some of my favourite actors, the reason I gave it a 5. Otherwise I would give it a 4.As I said, the plot is not new. Writing is mediocre. I think, I've been spoilt by European shows. The writing is better. The action is better. The storylines, in general, are just more enjoyable. Honestly, I really wanted to like this show, again, because of the actors. It's too bad it wasn't the case. If they do a second season, doubtful, I hope they try harder.",5
"So annoying- could have been good but bad acting, bad script, bad plot, plethora of clichés (snake tattoos, sociopath killers, guilty children, sailboat sex, secret stashes that just happen to show up at the right time, President in the dark betrayed by trusted staff ) killed it for me. But my wife liked it so I sat thru it. I didn't read the book but it can't be as bad as this, can it? If the FBI, Secret Service, Police etc are as incompetent as depicted here then we are really in trouble. If this show was a dinner you would have sent it back to the hack chef. Don't confuse this with ""The Night Manager"" cause that is Major League and this doesn't make it to the minors.",3
"I really enjoyed this movie! I watched all 10 episodes! Thank you to all the actors and producers! All who had a part in making this movie so fantastic! Peter and Rose were awesome! Peter looks so much like my son. Who is in the Air Force. All the actors were amazing.Please make another one for this summer.Even the bad guys did a great job! My family would love to see a continuation of this series,
I gave it 10! For great performance! Best thriller and action packed! I was really wowed watching this movie!I can't wait to the movie you make! Thanks again and have a great summer time. Be safe!",10
"I am really enjoying this series, and I can't stand much scripted television lately. The villains so far revealed are two vicious paid assassins and they are in love. Or so the psychotic female character is, and this is hard to reconcile with her enjoyment of the murder of the kind lady who let her tour her home. At least she left the baby alive she and her assassin partner departed the home with the dead woman.I couldn't follow how the bad characters who order deaths like Door Dash are connected to the White House so far, but I am sure it is coming.One blooper was not making sure the door was closed when the agent left his apartment. I plan to also go back and see what camera brand that was placed on the bookshelf in case I need one someday. I might need one someday.",10
"The plot is ok and the antagonists were just mediocre, but what made the big difference to me was the likable casts (fresh) and the 24/Bourne-esque style and pace of the show that kept me on the edge of my seat. I ended up binging on this show in three sittings.You'll truly enjoy this show if you can look past the cliches and the unrealistic parts of the show - which is not uncommon in this genre. The series ended satisfactorily but it made me want more.Netflix originals lately have been meh, but they got it right in this one.I highly recommend that you give this show a chance and not read too much into the bad review.",8
"The 10-part series starts of with the Jason Borne vibes and carries itself with turns and twists enough to get the viewers hooked early on to find out what happens next. However, as the plot slowly unravels, the story starts to stray from reality to the point of impossibility.Functions of the FBI, Secret Service, and overall National Security are reduced to child's play. NHS (National Homeland Security) has no role in the coverage of the domestic terrorism plot. White House Chief of Staff is empowered to give assignments to the 2 protagonists, one is a civilian, and the other is a fairly newbie FBI agent to solve the terrorist plot without the knowledge of the director of the FBI or the director of the Secret Service. Besides the NHS, the Military Intelligence and CIA have no serious involvement in the case either.The male protagonist, all-American national hero prototype Peter Sutherland's (Gabriel Bosso) character is written more like a state trooper who writes speeding tickets on the highway. His feelings are not presented on his face. His partner, female protagonist Rose Larkin (Luciane Buchanan) on the hand neither looks like a hacker nor acts like a former million-dollar self-made business entrepreneur. But she is a firecracker and reminded me of Olivia Munn's character Casey Brackett in the 2018 ""Predator"" film.I think that they should have explored more of the crazed killer's character Eilen (Eve Harlow) who appears to adore killing as a form of art. The best acting comes from Hong Chau's character Diane Far. She stands out from all the rest.It's watchable and entertaining despite being so far away from reality.",6
"Would have been better at 6 episodes. So predicable. Over powering blue colour throughout. Why?Another one that was written backwards to make as many twists as possible but unfortunatly everyone saw them coming before they happened. Another american show with container yards empty of any workers, bullets the go at right angles once fired and super heroes who are able to run away from soilders with rifles and not get shot.Set up for a second season, but not sure it will make it. For a guy wanting to go live in a cabin to suddenly go travel the world as a night agent and leave behind rose was a bit off.",5
It's a really gods series with a lot of plot twists. The story is pretty gods. So I would say that this series is one of the best to came out this year. The start of this series had me from the first second. The actors are also pretty good at there roll. So I have to say that this series is so good that I'am looking forward to watch ist again. So please Netflix bring another season from this piece of art. The length of this season is also pretty accurate I never was at this point we're I think Dawn this Episode is long. The special effect are ok. The selecting of the location are good as well.,8
"I can't understand the bad reviews. I'm not sure why people who watch a fictional show expect real life. This is a gritty, fast paced action/thriller series which keep you on the edge of your seat throughout. I feel like the people who have left bad reviews are the same people who are stuck up, snobbish and generally complain about every last thing in life! Live a little, this series is brilliant. It has everything you could want in a thriller, and gives nothing away until the very last moment, it will have you shouting from your seat and usually your guesses about the who bad guy is will be wrong!",10
"Am I losing my edge? My perceptive powers? How this befuddlement could achieve a Richteresque SEVEN actually gives me disquieting chills. Why Ms Chau didn't throw a foot-stomp 'in T- Rex fit when they slapped silver-gray, morality - is - neutral wig on her is a monumental puzzlement. Talk about a spy movie with ALL CUTOUTS ! I'm all for actors getting work, but don't put them in manacles, dress 'em up in spy suits, put 'em in cars that drop out of the heavens, come with pre- installed tracking device, female assassins who can leap to OP's in a nanosecond,and pyrotechnics worthy of a Godzilla 1955. Waited For an Age for Scooby to show up..Alas, he never did.",1
"The writing is pretty bad and the acting mediocre at best, though this is a fun watch and I did make it all the way through. Good for a weekend where you have nothing going on and need some filler show until the next great one comes out. There is potential yet falls somewhat short. Plot fairly predictable in certain parts, fast-paced sometimes yet slightly on the slow side other times. I've seen other people saying it's low budget but I did not get that impression at all. It seems like they could have gotten better writing and acting for the budget they did have. All in all, it's a fun watch so give it a go.",7
The only thing I dislike about this show is that it's just 10 episodes. No moment wasted. Storyline builds quickly and effectively captures attention. I watched all 10 episodes in one sitting. I couldn't keep my eyes off. The cast is amazing. Enough action scenes and conspiracies to make it a true thriller and espionage tv show. I just love how the story is told and the progression. No room to get bored. It feels like something out of a Robert Ludlum novel. I can't wait to see more of this in the next season. I kept thinking this is the type of situation Jack Bauer would find himself in...only that Peter is much humane compared to Bauer. Absolutely loved every bit of it. Rose is a real badass tho. She wasn't made to be your usual damsel in distress. I loved that she could hold her own.,9
"I don't usually watch American TV shows, so this was a welcome change.Currently on episode 9 out of 10.I found the story intriguing, albeit a little predictable. There were some funny parts which lightened the serious atmosphere. Some episodes were more interesting than others and left you yearning for more.I liked the dynamic between Rose and Peter. Moreover, it was nice to see the relationship between Chelsea and Monks improve. Maddie was a frustrating character at first, however, you end up understanding her resentment/attitude, as well as admiring her intelligence when kidnapped.I was disappointed with the use of almost constant explicit language; certain characters worse than others (Diane). It was unnecessary and headache inducing.The acting, on the whole, was decent. However, some characters were amateur-like, over-acting or generally annoying/boring to watch, in parts. Easy to ignore this, though.Recommend watching this show.",6
"I came here really to complain (criticize?) most suspense/mystery/thriller series or movies made in the USA. THE NIGHT AGENT had promising reviews & a great, if clichéd, premise (a conspiracy in the White House). So, what went wrong? There are several plot holes & improbabilities that you don't see in similar Euro series.For one thing, to make the Senior character more impressive, the young FBI agent who is the NIGHT AGENT reports to the White House Chief of Staff!!! In real life, for example, 'Alex Haig and Bob Haldeman' were Chiefs for Nixon. I read the POST Watergate books and those 2 guys had NOTHING to do with Intelligence Gathering or who answers the Watch Officer phone in the basement. I don't think Trump's guys did either.We also have the 'Hitchcockian' tool of an innocent person on the run and ""you can't trust anybody--there's a mole in the White House.."". Ho hum.. These gadgets can still be effective if a tone of realism is mixed in. For example, if I hire an assassin, and he is only partly successful, I don't keep him around chasing the witness-- I give him a cheque & put him in a plane to Tasmania--I can get another guy (that no one HAS seen) to clean up the mess. I'm afraid that, if you watch the police-based Euro series, the writers get these details right from the 'gitgo'--I have viewed scenes of 30-40 street 'plods' crawling across the lawn near a murder scene looking for trace evidence. That's a lot of trouble for a 6-second scene just to add fidelity. It's hard work, but the Director does it. Sometimes you wonder if it IS a movie!In tbis, and other U. S. produced Netflix series, they simply cut those corners, leaving 5 or 6 plot holes in every story.Having said that, this is kind of a no-brainer fun action series, and the acting is great. There are just too many dumb lines to recite.",6
"Well, I took a chance and followed the ratings from IMDB but shouldn't have. This comes across as a very low-budget drama. Acting was subpar for half the actors involved. Maybe the acting could have been elevated if the writing had been better. As one other review mentioned, there was so much about this series that was just plain implausible if not farcical.I'm no prude but I don't know why writers think throwing F bombs into the dialogue in almost every conversation is going to elevate the program. It did just the opposite for me. It dragged it down.So my suggestion is if you have nothing to do on a rainy day some weekend and don't mind binge watching, go for it. Otherwise, clean the silverware or drive to town and buy a new pair of gloves or something more worthwhile.",5
Watched the first episode and am probably done. Violence in the series is not supported by a well constructed narrative. And it is not enhanced by a less than charismatic lead actor. Pretty but vapid. And the Deputy Director . . . What's with that terrible wig that she can't act past. The last moment of the episode was the clincher. The baby-in-danger bit was lazy and manipulative. We've moved beyond that in other streaming series'. There are so many other worlds to spend time with. This one doesn't move beyond the typical network fare. The actors here that are competent are totally wasted. Find something else; there is plenty of worthwhile stuff out there. But this one to bed.,4
"Made it to the end of episode 4 and can't handle it anymore. Bad acting, poor story line, no excitement. What a let down from Netflix. Can't understand why it is #1 on Netflix. Felt like it was made In somebody's backyard. No real connection with the actors. I particularly am not a fan of the acting of the chief of staff. She does not play the role well and it does not feel believable. I don't feel like I am in the white house. I feel like I am at a local town hall meeting.The videography also is subpar. The shots and colors lack visual appeal and excitement. Really disappointed in this show.",1
"Great show, inteligent, but without being extremely complicated, a classic example of a political thriller. The cast are all amazing and I found I cared about all of them particularly when some dont survive. I like how we find out the real situation about Peters father and if he was Innocent or Guity, and that Rose really comes to show herself to be an amazingly strong Woman as she saves Peter's life several times during the episodes and her treatment of Diane Farr in the last episode. The relationship between Chelsea and her protectee VPs Daughter Maddie is well written and performed brilliantly. One of the best things about this is the 10 Episode run, I loved 24 but this has the advantage that everything is much tighter, but with the same quality of twists and turns. Also, even though the CoS ended up corrupt, I still cared about her and didn't want to see her end up getting the full brunt of punishment. I do hope netflix commissions more as would love to see how Peter and Rose have a relationship, that is probably my only regret that they did not become Night Agents together but it could easily be made to happen in S2..",10
"I'm giving this a generous 6 since it tried and there were a few redeeming qualities about it.Nevertheless, This was infuriating at times with the level of stupidity of some of the characters. There was also the incredibly impossible fantasyland of a world this took place in. About 50% of the dialog was insufferable and would have been better off if they just removed it and cut this series in half. And lastly, the acting, specifically that of Hong Chau, was like watching a lot of the acting in daytime soaps. Overdone, misplaced, or completely lacking expression.With all that said, it was still entertaining and yes I watched it all the way through. It was a good gap filler when there nothing else to watch.",6
"This show makes no sense right from the start.Spoiler alert but apparently it's an assassination plot against the President and everyone around her is in on it including the nice Asian lady chief of staff who had been her friend for 20 years but betrays her for no apparent reason.But why go to all that trouble when they could've just poisoned her tea at any time?It's not like any of the other serous, high profile crimes they committed we're investigated by anyone.It would have taken 5 minutes reviewing CCTV for any cop to figure out that Peter wasn't responsible for the ludicrously botched train bombing and given him a medal for saving dozens of lives.Why didn't the Aunt & Uncle just run away when assassins came to their house?Surely the assassins randomly kidnapping a baby would've brought maximum heat onto them?Why was it even necessary for them to kidnap a baby?Why would a whole team of Secret Service agents walk off the job without getting relieved? I have seen volunteer lollipop ladies show more dedication than that.How did the assassins get the jump on the retired secret agent lady who was more paranoid than a weed smoking Vietnam vet?Surely she would've had a claymore mine rigged up to her back door?Why did they bury her body but not any of the other victims?Why didn't the neighbors call the cops immediately when they saw the assassins had broken in next door?How did the assassins stroll out of there while the cops were staking them out? Why didn't they call for a Swat team backup?And on it goes.",1
I stumbled across this on Friday night and I am so glad I did!! It keeps you on the edge of your seat!! I didn't want to take a break from it to go to sleep. They did an excellent job making you think twice as to who they should trust and confide in!! Every time you think you have it figured out they throw another curve ball at you. It kept me on the edge of my seat!! Saturday morning I started watching where I left off on Friday night and again I had trouble turning it off to get some errands done. I started watching it again Saturday night and didn't get to sleep until 2:30 in the morning because I had to know how it ended! Gabriel Basso and Luciane Buchanan played well off of each other! I really enjoyed their chemistry! Everyone in this cast did an amazing job on this show!! I highly recommend this show if you are into thrillers and like a show that keeps you guessing. Looking forward to season 2!,10
"1. Very little chemistry between the leads
2. The ""villains"" make Boris and Natasha seem realistic
3. Thoroughly unlikable Chief of Staff (and a wooden performer, in this series anyway.)
4. Unnecessary abundance of ""F-bomb"" variations. One can imagine creating a drinking game centered on how many F-bombs per line there could be
5. Amateur hour dialogue for-the-most-part anyway
6. Plot holes galore
7. Over-the-top performances from much of the cast
8. Are Government Employees really as stupid as this series portrays them? Well, in real life, probably so.9. All of the D. I. E. Boxes and more checked
10. If realism had been considered essential to this series, then disappointment is in order
11. In summation, I was initially intrigued with the concept and some of the cast of this series...but, this is a near-total failure. Just my opinion of course.",2
I could tell within 3 minutes that this was going to be another immature badly written show. All it took was the main character to say 'I've got you!' to a little girl whilst rescuing her and it was downhill from thereLazy cliched dialogue trying to make a story interesting for teenagers(?) can't see any grown adult that would talk to another person in the way these characters do. Workplaces where normal rules of how people behave or interact don't apply.Characters are over emotional rather than interesting and I just constantly think they never represent the types of people that would be in these roles which completely undermines any belief in them.,2
"Let's catch some serial intrigue and action, I figured, but this series wasted little time before pat archetypes gave way to trite stereotypes as hamnfisted misdirection left me wondering why a ""THIS IS NOT A RED HERRING"" subtitle wasn't employed to underline how little regard this series has for its viewers and their lack of critical faculties.Indeed ""The Night Agent"" wastes little time before thumbing its nose at viewers with silly little gaffes like a supposed ace evil assassin who holds her pistol ""teacup"" style ala Sabrina in ""Charlies Angel's,"" to name just one. Who needs armorer training, or for that matter script editors or acting coaches when you assume your audience consists of numbskulls perfectly happy to lap up the pap Sony Pictures tries to feed them here?I gave up in episode 5, just after our heart of gold FBI agent protagonist's gun went ""click"" instead of ""boom"" in the middle of a fight, leading to an inane hand to hand battle because the writers need to fill a full hour, don'tcha know, so plot devices like a federal agent carrying a gun that doesn't work at critical junctures and who neglect their training by failing to perform a tap/rack failure drill make perfect sense as that hour has to be filled by something, anything regardless of whether it makes sense.Many here clearly suspended disbelief willingly and embraced all the contradictions and technical lapses; if doing so floats your boat have at this mess. If instead you seek some sort of return on time invested gazing at a screen and prefer casts and crews that don't assume the audience consists of candidates for protective restraint, pass this one by.",2
"The Night Agent is a solid modern ""who's behind this?"" spy drama, although it doesn't stray much from the usual tropes. The good guy has dozens of close shaves with death, and many around him don't survive.As is typical, it's pretty easy to spot which friends and allies are there to be the one's who don't survive.I also hate the Bodyguard love interest which no one can ever seem to avoid, including here. But I will say the two characters did seem to have a very good chemistry, and more than most, their affection seemed warranted. Also, they didn't try to make it overly sexual, but something a bit deeper connection. Good job writers, even if you did go there.And the relationship between the ""Hit Couple"" was good and entertaining, and showed a level of complexity that few spend time in developing. Very good job here.My biggest disappointment was probably in the fact that the final event was so dramatic. If it's not ""save the world"", it does often boil down to ""save the President"", etc. Hey, saving a couple dozen/hundred regular folk should be a very big deal.Solid 8, which was really closer to a 9. If you have limited time, be sure to pick this over ""The Recruit"", which starts out well, and becomes more silly in the latter episodes.",8
"A great pilot, in the vein of the Jack Ryan series of movies, is soon followed by another generic, boring streaming series. Our hero from the pilot is rapidly turned into a useless wimp while the girl he was set-up to protect becomes generic strong female character of the 2020's why he just stumbles with befuddlement through scenes of her telling him what to do.Oh, and filler. This is a streaming show, remember? That means about 2, 2.5 hrs of content stretched over approximately 10 hours. So every episode is padded with boring, useless dialogue of backstory or relashionship, even between the hired assassins, until the end of the episode where, Stranger Things style, we get 5 minutes or so of real story that abruptly ends.The fact that this is so highly rated speaks volume to just how terrible politically-correct entertainment has become.",1
"Except for the unnecessary excessive overuse of the f-word (that Netflix is famous for), this is a decent series. I would have doubled the rating if language could have been more creative. Nice to see some newer faces as the main characters. The time flashbacks to explain how they got to here can be a bit confusing if you miss the flash on the screen ""one year ago,"" etc. It's always a good story when you struggle with who the protagonists are. We're on episode 9 now. We'll make 10 tonight. If there's another season, maybe Netflix can increase their vocabulary. Profane doesn't have to be vulgar.",5
"My 80-something father loves it. I would rather clean out garbage cans than watch this, nevertheless I'm watching it bc my dad loves it. Night Agent is not good. High production value. Good action (if you're into that; I'm NOT.) I've walked out of theaters on films like this. The writing is so bad it makes good actors bad. I'm not a fan of Hong Chau to begin...this has increased my disinterest in her. If you're 60+ and prefer movies to films, you might like it. If you prefer action to character development, you might like this. I'm in the middle of episode four and I'm about to fake a debilitating illness to escape. D*",2
"This is really poor, but unfortunately typical for a run of the mill, couldn't care less Netflix show. There are far too many episodes for the writers to be able to create and maintain a coherent plot. The acting is abysmal - totally wooden and unwatchable. Netflix could possibly stop producing so much rubbish and put a bit of effort into giving us one or two shows that are worth watching. It betrays a contempt for the critical judgment of its audience. I can't understand how any reviewer can give it even a hint of approval. If I could have given it zero I would have done. 1 out of ten is flattering.",1
"I don't review very often but this series deserves a special place in 'meh'.Gabriel Basso is surprisingly believable in a Jason Bourne-esque way and the plot line itself is engaging but, and I can't stress this enough, the dialogue is awful. There's so much exposition that it feels as if we - the viewer - are being treated like idiots. Beyond cliché and into the land of parody.Also, I've no idea what the wardrobe dept thought they were doing by dying Hong Chau's hair grey and pumping it with hair spray?!In the right hands this could have been a real contender with the excellent Jack Reacher series but it fails to live up to the premise.5/10.",5
"I love political action shows so I was excited to see Night Agent released this weekend. Not going to lie, I did binge watch it in 3 days. I felt like the writing could have been a little better, but overall, found it really entertaining and felt like the plots were intriguing. If you like shows like Homeland or Jack Ryan, you'll like the Night Agent. I hope it renews for a second season! I also hope Netflix and other TV show producers create more political action packed shows like this one. I think it's definitely worth watching if you like this genre of shows. I just wish there were more out there like it!",7
"I think it would have been much better if it had been 5-6 episode top. 10 was a kind of exaggeration. However, it is not bad at all.The production value is top-notch in every sense, there is no shaky 'home video' style BS here, which is fantastic. The male lead is a bit heavy on acting, not bad but not great either. The female lead is great, not because of her stature but her acting makes the whole story gel. All the other actors are doing a fine job.The story - America f@ck itself - is not new, to say the least, but have a good array of movies like that, Three Days of the Condor comes to mind first.It is a solid, slow burner thriller not to blame any other nation or religion but themselves. The scapegoat? There is always one.",7
"I read all the hyped-up reviews and was excited for something good to watch while waiting for the new '23 seasons of the flagship shows to drop.Even the first scene had some implausibilities, but I kept going. After the stupid fakeout of a cop finding her in the closet (ridiculous!) was so unbelievable, I turned it off immediately, not making it even half way through the pilot.Netflix will most likely cancel this before the 2nd season, and now, might even want to stop releasing whole seasons on day one as a cost-saving measure, as most NF decision-makers would have seen how bad this was and likely pulled the plug after 3-4 episodes.Save yourself. Something better will come along soon.",1
"I enjoyed how they put the story line together, but I would have liked a cliffhanger at the end. I liked how there were story lines of the bad guys in cahoots and then the secret service bonding, and then a little relationship building with the FBI Agent and the girl. Assassins also having a story line. Many great details in the script were enjoyable, but there were also some head scratchers.I'm a simple man, good action, not too much gore, limited nudity. Some unrealistic things at times I noticed, but still engaging. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed it.I would recommend and I hope there is a season 2.",10
"It's not perfect but it sure is engaging!No idea what the very bad reviews are all about here! Not all performances are going to be like Succession! Don't know why they were expecting a Emmy-winning performance from the show. Let's go with the bad first: the script is not perfect, there are obvious holes, but then, again in a show, like this, you don't expect to get that! The direction could've been better and so too the acting but largely only on occasion. The worst is The storyline to the contrary to other reviews is reasonably original BUT rediculously preposterous. But that is where the negatives end for me! Now for the good: the show is engaging and keeps you watching! The performances are decent and believable... if sometimes overstretched. However the show is well worth the watch and a decent step for Netflix and Sony! I believe there will be a season two, and the next one should be well, thought through with a better script this time, with better direction!",7
"Was not expecting this to be this good , Excellent series , loved it. There hasn't been an action series created like this for a long time. As a fan of '24', 'Homeland', and 'Person of Interest', I have missed shows like that. This show is up there with them. Only gripe is the unnecessary profanities throughout. I think the beauty of The Night Agent is how everything comes together at the end , with a new piece of the puzzle being unraveled each episode. You wouldn't want to stop. Great action series, very suspensefulTotally recommend , despite some plot holes and a few predictable plots10/10.",10
"TV spy thrillers are often silly and formulaic, but The Night Agent reaches a new low in that respect. The plot is implausible and incoherent, bordering on nonsensical. The acting is also wooden and uninspiring. Honestly 10 episodes seem too many to tell a story that could be told in fewer installments, especially considering that, unlike in the best spy thrillers, there are no significant plot twists. The ""villains"" so to speak are disclosed pretty soon (approximately half-way in Season 1) and the attempted plot twist at the end turns out to be highly predictable. Still, it is an entertaining flick despite being generic and forgettable. For better products in the same genre, I suggest looking at British spy series.",5
"Okay, to everyone that stopped after episode 1: This show is REALLY good. For me i finished in one sitting. If you're a fan of Jack Ryan , The Night Manager , 24 and the rest , you will surely like this series. It gets better and better. Netflix totally surprised me with this one. Great actors , great plot (two interesting story arcs), surprisingly well-written characters (even the ""bad guys""). The pilot episode felt a bit clunky at times , but as I mentioned earlier , this show only gets better .And not to forget ,i really loved the naming of every single episodes which are based on the first ten minutes of every episodes..
Incredible idea.Can't wait for Season 2.",10
"This is a great show. I can't believe all the reviews about it not being realistic and a misrepresentation.It's a tv show. It's written to entertain, not represent exact scenarios or actual systems within the FBI or secret service.Police academy made 7 movies after all, we don't believe that's how our police department are ran do we?Lighten up and enjoy it for the drama and the ride it takes you on.I wasn't familiar with either of the leads but I thought they were good. It definitely had me wanting more from the first episode.I will be recommending and hoping for more.I'm not a book guy but apparently there is a book so I will even attempt to give it a read.It is quite thrilling but very much an easy watch and bingeable show.",10
"Looking for something new to watch after binging 'You,"" I came across Night Agent. I thought I'd give it a look. I've lasted for 6 episodes and checked out IMDB to see if it's just me... this lead actor is the worst I've ever seen. Maybe it was the lateness of the night, 2am that makes me so critical. Who knows. But, please don't ever give this guy another acting job.As somebody who lives in DC, I have to say they did a good job with the opening scene on Metro. At one time, for security reasons you weren't allowed to film in the stations. Anybody who lives here and has watched House of Cards can tell you all the Metro scenes were wrong in that show. It was odd that when he found the bomb, he didn't immediately make a call. There's cell service, even in the tunnels. Also, everybody who commutes knows ""if you see something, say something."" It's unbelievable that he's the only one who notices a dude in a black hooded jacket shoving a backpack under a seat. We always have our heads on a swivel, it's ingrained in us.While I was watching this, I kept thinking how much better this would be if done by British TV. They have a way of doing mystery, thriller, cop drama that is second to none. And, they can do it in 6 episodes.I'll finish this but it will be torture.Gave it a 6 for a half way decent story and good Metro scene.",6
"The idea of rogue elements within the government may not be new, but the series presents the issues with fresh perspective and style.The camera point of view film method used for the series is called the Subjective Film Technique. The next decision made by the director was to remove emotional scoring that would influence the viewing audience to take a side in any scene. Only emotional trigger points are scored but just within the subjects scene themselves. Typically films with bad guys or terrorists are filmed in an objective manner, not so here. We are given for example a couple who are domestic terrorists named Ellen and Dale. The audience is left with an examination of their daily life. Their thoughts on living in a normal house with picket fence living. This can be unnerving at times. Unsettling yet thought provoking. Later, the script releases some of this tension finally by showing the audience that even these characters know they are mentally ill. Perhaps in reality we wonder, is this also a truth?Truths in any movie can be personal, and more so in this series because we are asked to come up with our own. We are not given direction. Not everyone is who they seem. Mature audiences will enjoy this intellectual examination for its neutral non-bias stand, others who are offended must understand its done for the purpose to see more angles within the material.",8
"If you loved all the many versions of Tom Clancy movies and series, I think The Night Agent is better. And I loved all the Tom Clancy shows! Gabriel Basso and Luciane Buchanan are perfect as the two leads in this series, playing our heroes Peter Sutherland and Rose Larkin. The rest of the cast is wonderful as well. So nice to see D. B. Woodside again as one of the other heroes. Also, I am a huge fan of Kari Matchett, who played President Travers. I could name the entire cast because they were all fantastic and played very well together.There were several writers and different directors, but whoever the show runner is? Did an amazing job of keeping the pace not only on track, but very fast paced.My husband and I have gotten so tired of the slow burning (AKA BORING) shows that keep being dumped on ALL internet apps lately, not just Netflix as some have mentioned in here. This one is what I call immersive. You LIVE inside it as you watch. It is a wonderful throwback to the shows from the 90's which were mostly packed with action and never lost your interest. I won't go into details to give away any spoilers, but it is comparable to the Clancy thrillers of the 80s, 90s, and 00s. Not sure when the slow burners started taking over which the artsy fartsy folks love so much but us regular folks who are too busy to invest precious time into something that just drags on and on and never seems to get anywhere. But how refreshing to watch a show that is smart, exciting, and cohesive and while it IS about politics, it isn't political or woke, so everyone can enjoy it without the tripwires that make you move on to the next one, hoping it will be better.I DO want The Night Agent to move on. Move on to Season 2 please, Netflix! Nice set up there so if you are too dumb to renew THIS one, at least we got this one wrapped up in the end. Very satisfying. I don't like giving out 10s as a rating, because nothing is that perfect. But I tried to think of SOMETHING to detract a star from my rating and loved this so much, I couldn't think of anything I thought could have been done better. Maybe a couple of plot holes. But far less than I saw in The Last of Us! So, for the first time in a long time, I gave The Night Agent an earned 10! We want MORE of these and LESS of the foreign, badly acted slow burners, Netflix! For once, keep what works! You have blown it more times these past few years than any other app I watch! Kudos for FINALLY getting one right!",10
This is a good classic 'baddies versus goodies' action series. I binge watched this and bought the book as well. I enjoyed the series despite the plot holes in some of the shooting and fight scenes.Gabriel Basso's character reminded me of Reacher. He also looks a bit like a young Arnold Shwartznegger. Eve Harlow reminded me of Helena Bonham Carter.I liked the non stop action and some of the twisty turns in the story. There were some annoying bits where characters behaved in ways which seemed implausible but on the whole it was a very relaxing way to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon. I watched the ten episodes and enjoyed it. I wonder if there will be another series? I hope so.,8
....every position of power is a woman. Why is it that in most of these shows being made today the women act like men and the men act like women? Femininity was the best thing you ladies had going for you and you seem to be doing just the opposite. The President is a woman. His boss is a woman. Even the assassin is a woman. So I am sure if you are a woman of today that has to constantly feel empowered this is the show for you. If you are a guy like me I found it to be more of a fairy tale than anything that could actually happen in real life. ALWAYS find it laughable to watch these 100 pound women take down and beat up men twice their size and strength.,3
"When the only actor in the cast that you recognise is Marciano, you know it's going to be a rough ride. The scene in the Metro looks like a back lot and the train doesn't look real. The only person that observes the bomber dump his cargo surreptitiously, is at the other end of the carriage and he works for the FBI ?! The acting is wooden, in fact it's not even that good. It would appear that no small amount of money got this up and running, but it's completely in vain. It would appear that nothing was spent on either writing or casting of the characters. In that sense, it comes across as nothing better than some daytime PBS potboiler.",3
"I loved this series and binged watched in one day. All actors are superb specially the two main lead their chemistry.The action , suspense and thriller bound us to connect with the series.I actually watched the series two times, and can watch it again. I had highly recommended to my friends and family to watch the series.In India it is still in Top 1 position from the time it is released and in other countries also.I hope they will announce the season 2 .We are waiting for the official announcement for the season 2.Second season will be more thrilling action packed and romantic one also.",10
"--Light Spoiler warning for anyone attempting to watch past the first episode ---Some great actors phoning it in, a script that must have been written by 1st year film school students, a screenplay written by a 6 year old, and a plot which is just laughably bad.Literally every spy/conspiracy trope thrown in for good measure, more ridiculous 'twists' than Shayamalanadingdong could hope for, 'hacking' where at one point the cybersecurity 'expert' tries to format an encrypted drive to access it - oh, a bluetooth wireless dongle in an air gapped secure white house FBI computer that is then allowed to install screen mirroring software? Surrrrrree.... The list of stupidity is almost endless.Added to all of this is the complete lack of emotional range any normal human beings would possibly show to the events unfolding.Don't even get me started on the 2 assassins and their ridiculous scenes.Which brings me back to the title - how the hell did this show get greenlit while quality TV shows get cancelled?",2
"Just finished this, it wasn't as bad as what some reviews state.Is it oscar worthy? .. No
Is it a Masterpiece?.. NoBut, what it is, is just pure entertainment, Fast paced and no nonsense enjoyment.Offcourse, the acting needs work, 100% the writing was a little concerning regarding dialogue, but, who cares.I mean, the mission impossible movies, Condor, The Bodyguard, Reacher, 24, which all fall into the same bracket, allthough great tv shows, are not masterpieces.Just pure entertainment from start to finish, and I hope Netflix do a season 2, I personally think it deserves another shot.I give it 7/10 which feels just right.",7
"This is a 10 episode show that will keep you guessing right up until the very end.The acting is quite good and the story line is solid. The Director allows enough opportunity for character development in the lead roles.It's not a big budget show but enough to make it believable and entertaining.It's not a re-hashed thriller like so much of what passes as entertainment today.As the story progresses, there are flash backs that will help develop the lead characters better and help answer questions about their motivations.Gabriel Brasso & Luciane Buchanan are exceptional in their roles.At the end, Peter finds out the truth regarding his Father.",8
"The story line and various complications are handled well, tension builds, but really not an outstanding piece of work. A time passer. Guess the end scenes leave open the possibility of further development of the two leads' relationship, but it looks like a long shot with the two going separate ways to follow obsessions over their careers. Series 2? Doubtful.There is too much time and effort devoted to fights and shooting encounters. The basic plot that some folks on government are beyond reason and willing to take it upon themselves to do the reprehensible because of erroneous convictions seems plausible, and so does their manipulation by others with clear but greedy objectives.I think this series has a good framework and capable actors, but treats its plot to too many wrinkles we have seen before.",6
"I love a good action thriller and this does a decent job of providing good thrills. The action is pretty slick, the characters are at times intriguing and entertaining, and the conspiratorial story leaves you wanting to get to the core of the mystery. At the same time, there's some stuff that will leave you dumbfounded. Dialogue can be silly, decisions or things characters miss can be goofy, and I rolled my eyes several times. It can also be pretty predictable. There were times I knew when a character would die or who the bad guys were. Even red herrings are fairly predictable. I also wasn't a fan of the big reveal and the motivations behind the main bad guys. Even for a show like this, they didn't feel all that believable. Overall though, the show is entertaining. It's nothing all that special, but it's an entertaining watch.",7
"There are so many limited series out there today. Some are great and some are just terrible. I was so impressed with this one. It took me back to the thriller type movies from the past. It involved the White House and even though you knew watching it that there was some ridiculous scenarios and hard to believe moments but here they don't matter to you. You are glued to your seat and are taken through many surprises and twists.The actors are all very impressive and believable. Loved seeing the scenes where Peter was fighting and Rose, not crying idly by, helped every time and save his life countless times
I hope there is another season. It sets up well for it.",9
"Wow! This was one of the best and most entertaining series in a long time. I love these conspiracy thrilling stories and this one was well done. Both main characters are great. The chinese lady I didnt like that much acting wise. Sometimes dialogues may occour a little cheesy and plain and simple. But the action and constantly wanting to know whats coming next are amazing! Camera quality, music and cinematic filming were great! Peter is very smart and likable and the ending is perfect in my eyes. If you like homeland, bodyguard, bourne, reacher, jack ryan - this one is for you! Its not that deep with character development like homeland, but for me it was the perfect entertainment! Hoping for a lot of seasons to come!!!",10
"Il be honest off the Bat the acting in this isn't great and I kinda worked out who was the bad guy fairly quickly! But I did enjoy it and the below par acting actually works with the dry persona of agents and how you would expect them to behave, so it actually really worked well!Well paced series that unfolds and gains momentum each episode to a well rounded season finale, violence not to over the top if anything maybe a little more would be good, some of the hits would have been good to cut back to mid interrogation so you get a feel for the hit man and woman's sadistic nature but that's all I missed.Other than that great binge fest and will be extremely annoyed if they make a season 2 and cancel on a cliff hanger like Netflix usually do! It's really they only thing to worry about when picking up a new netflix show to watch!",8
"Not all that bad! I was pleasantly surprised how much I liked this show. It has all the boxes ticked for me with decent cast, good story and mix of drama and action. Funny at times and enjoyed watching all the episodes. All of them. Yes some eye roll moments and bad acting from some of the actors (at times) but better than many other new shows being made. Main characters worked well together and had good chemistry throughout show. I would definitely recommend to friends as something to check out if they are looking for something good to watch.Finally something I kinda liked and did not feel the usual forced in your face bs... gets solid 9 from me!",9
"This isnt a bad show but its pretty standard fare for a netflix thriller. The acting is bad clear across the board but the writing, well the writing is bad, no good, bad. Plot holes you can run a truck through, scenes that you have to leave all sense of logic behind. Way to much backstory for certain characters that are not necessary. The two main assassins they tried to horseshoe in a weird love story and it wasn't needed and didn't work. It was like they got 10 episodes and had to add a bunch to the story to make it last that long. It all ends in a neat package like these always do its a decent watch.",6
"Mildly entertaining. Weak and totally unbelievably script. Agent is knocked unconscious but still able to chase down bad guy after train explosion and not one officer is there to assist.Bad guys have to retrieve black bag from home owner. Instead of just going in and stealing it. They keep snap an infant, pretend they are returning to their old home and end up murdering the home owner anyway???FBI director insists that agent can listen to higher level meeting, but then the agent just stands outside the door while they scream at each other on the other side of door.Agent is manning super fbi hot line, but then just finds time to aimlessly talk to girl friend on the hot line.Finally acting by fbi director and chief of staff, very melo dramatic.Ok to watch for simple amusement but certainly not worth a 7.7. Lots of action, some of it superfluous.",5
"Decent acting for the most part.Otherwise, this story had all the things the viewer expects and let's face it wants.There are the perfectly foiled partnerships of the vulnerable but gritty girl who will fall for her good guy hero and the calm cool assassin with his ride or die crazy in love murderess. We got the blue collar hardworking don't trust anyone secrete agents. One dies. Yes, he was black. Might as well have put him in a red shirt from the start.Got the villain who thinks he needs to destroy things to save the world. Got the other villain who thinks she is in it to protect the institution. Got the other villain who is in for the money. Check, check, and check.The plot had all the spy secret assassin cat and mouse games and all the predictable conclusion. Even the dead-end plot lines were predictable. All to be wrapped up in a nice little bow by the final episode.Why did I watch it? Well I was sick on the couch. It killed time. It was binged. Slow Horses is better.",5
"A spy thriller that's been done plenty of times before. Didn't read the novel, and now don't feel the need to. My biggest issue has to do with the acting, including the male lead. He was a cardboard cutout of FBI/Secret Service ""square-jaws"" we've all seen too often. And plenty of poor acting 'accolades' to the rest of the cast, except for Luciane Buchanan, the female lead. While we've seen this 'damsel-in-distress' character many times, Buchanan brings a modern sensibility to her role. She was the best thing about the series. She is in danger, but when she takes action it seems fairly realistic to the character.Someone on here asked, 'Why the bad reviews?'. Welp, bad acting, bad writing, bad directing, and MANY plot holes. That's why. I fast-forwarded through much of the show because it was so cringey and predictable.Watch Krasinski's Jack Ryan series to see something superior (although the current season wasn't as good as the prior ones).",3
"Well, I almost overlooked this one and I'm so glad I doubled back to have a look at this. What a fun ride. Excellent cast. Great writing. Delightful surprise to see ""Martin"" from Super 8 all grown up and playing the leading man. Very much enjoyed seeing him in this role.So many twists and turns. Lots of mystery and suspense. Great action. A satisfying number of edge-of-your-seat moments.I really liked the performed believability of each character's experience.And of course, a good underdog story is always enjoyable.Well-developed characters you could root for or against. I connected emotionally with the characters, even the antagonists.The show had you going from start to finish. Was sad when it was over cuz now I'm not sure what to follow this show with, but the season had a very satisfying resolution. I'm definitely here for another season.",8
"I was intrigued by the trailer. It did not disappoint!This is a really well written, directed, and acted TV show. A good one on the back of ""The Recruit"" from Netflix.This is much more grounded and realistic with your usual stuff, but that is what makes it a good political

... and now The Night Agent, I'd say this is a good time to be a fan of the genre.So Why bad reviews? It didn't seem low quality or budget. I really hope there will be a second seasonPS - I've only mentioned TV shows of the genre that are still running and not cancelled/ ended.",10
"""The Night Agent"" is an incredibly engaging and thrilling TV series that will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The storyline is intricately woven and the pacing is perfectly executed, making for a truly binge-worthy experience. The show is filled with twists and turns that will leave you guessing until the very end.One of the standout features of the series is the fantastic cast. The talented actors bring their characters to life with incredible depth and nuance. Gabriel Basso's lead character, Peter Sutherland, is particularly noteworthy. He delivers a captivating performance that is both intense and emotional. Luciane Buchanan & Sarah Desjardins both are very beautiful & fantastic.The supporting cast is equally impressive, with standout performances from the likes of Fola Evans-Akingbola, D. B Woodside. Their characters add layers of complexity to the story and keep the audience invested in the outcome.Overall, ""The Night Agent"" is a must-watch for anyone who loves a good action thriller & romance. The series is expertly crafted, with stunning visuals, a captivating storyline, and a talented cast that brings it all to life. If you haven't already seen it, I highly recommend giving it a watch!",10
"The Night Agent is packed with mystery, action and intrigue. It's a must see show which truly delivers an excellent storyline. Best new series I've seen in a while! Hopeful for a second season. This story is too good to leave it as the season ended. The lead actors delivered a great performance and for the ladies, Gabriel Basso is a refreshing new face which will entice viewers. He portrays a young FBI agent trying to make it in a world of corrupt politicians. His character is a bit green in the beginning but quickly proves he can do the job. It's an intelligent, action packed thriller which will not disappoint!",10
"I thoroughly enjoyed this series! Watched it from start to finish over two days.Having never seen any of Gabriel Basso's previous worked, I was pleasantly surprised by his ability to carry this film. He made a for believable character and his acting was good.Initially I was worried it wouldn't conclude and I'd be hanging on for another season's release. Fortunately, as I've read, there will be an additional season but each with its own storyline which has a start, middle and end. This makes it far more worthy in my books.I'll definitely be looking out for the next season release of this series.",9
"The premise of this show is great, somewhere in between Bourne Identity and Enemy of the State, so I looked forward to this.It started with great pace and quite decent acting. I could accept the small gaps in the writing, because the action is good. I also accepted the weakest link, which is in my opinion the two dumb criminals, who were really annoying and don't fit in the thriller style of the series (some sort of Harlan Coben style version of Bonnie and Clyde).What I really detest is Netflix's obsession to keep people stuck to the screen by streching the length of its TV series, leading to useless scenes, even complete episodes, that you can simply skip all together.This series would've been so much better it it were told in 'just' 5 episodes. Ultimately, I quit watching after the 6th episode knowing I had to endure another 4 of the same. Such a waste. Netflix stop with stretching the length of your series!!!!",5
"I had originally drafted a bad review after watching the first two episodes. Please keep going because you will be in for a surprise, an awesome one!!The first two episodes of the series were completely different from the rest of the series...they were badly made, badly directed and topped up by bad acting. The only actor that had kept me going was Peter, the Night Agent. He carried his character as well as he could despite the weak script and the bad direction in the first two episodes. The series took a sudden and surprising turn from about the third episode. It was almost as if they had hired a brand new writer and a brand new director. The actors suddenly settled well into their characters and were suddenly doing a great job of acting! The story too took a great turn. I didn't know what to make of it. The rest of the series will keep you hooked and fascinated. So, please don't give up after the first two episodes.... I was ready to move on after the first 2 episodes and it would have been a big mistake. I am really glad that I hung in there....",8
"This ticks all the wrong boxes. It is a very generic plot with all the usual red herrings you can see coming from a mile away. The acting is flat. The main character acts like it's his first weekend on the job. The assassin couple is nothing new. They actually reminded me a bit of the ones in Archer, but without the humor.And because the amount of actors is actually very low, you can completely predict who had an opportunity to put some spyware on a certain phone....It is getting tiresome how these series are produced, they try hooking you with a nice opening scene, that's where the budget goes. And then it just drags on and on and on.Throughout the series there is never any real tension.Unfortunately a lot of fake optimism in reviews to bump up the numbers. Anyone who ever saw any spy thriller knows this is mediocre at best. 4 /10.",4
"And his name is Gabriel Basso!!!Gabriel Basso is going places, I'm telling you, he's great!I love the character of Rose too, she's a firecracker!!It's got a lot of potential as a whole, I'm not sure if it's the script or just the execution, but something makes it feel a bit B Grade.... There's some pretty terrible acting in this show... All of the villains are very terrible! The acting is anyway....
Story is actually good!... but I've not read the books so I can't compare it.I look forward to seeing if it gets a second season, I wanna see what the future has in stall for Peter and Rose. I like it enough to keep watching!!",6
"I gave this series 5 stars out of 10. As I state in my title, take it or leave it. It's ""OK"" TV, not great, but not terrible. There are scenes that are terrific, and others that have me screaming at the TV.If I could have given 51/2 stars I would have. I didn't feel like I was ripped off and scamed by a crappy series, it was pretty good, but it suffers from what I call ""Lazy writing"" at times. Lazy writing is what I really despise in a movie or series. What do I mean by lazy writing? Well, the script writer puts our heroes in a really tight and dangerous situation or has them needing to escape a dangerous situation and they are able to do it without much effort. Everything that the heroes needs to fall in place that will allow them to come out on top happens. You need to escape from the White House when every single Secret Service agent is looking for you, no problem, just hide behind this wall as an agent walks right past you and then you go where he was. Be able to swipe a key card from a collegue in order to go in and out of rooms because your key card has been disabled. It's amazing how there could be a rogue in the W. H. and yet they are able to easily escape. That is lazy writing. Putting our heroes in the most diifficult situations and making the escape easy.The best thing about this series was the female lead Luciane Buchanan. She is a terrific actor, had great lines, and is a fresh face I expect we will see a lot of in the future.We have an FBI agent whose job is to sit in a room in the W. H. and man a phone that might ring. If it rings it means an agent is in trouble. One night it rings and our hero has a young woman on the line that says her aunt & uncle told her to call this number because there are men in the house trhat are trying to kill them and her. That's how it starts. From here on out we get the ""Reluctant Buddy"" story. Two people forced to work together who start off opposing each other. (Yawn) We have assasination plots, treason, murder, spies, secret agents, the whole 9 yards.If you watch this it won't be a complete waste of time. But it won't be on any top 10 lists as a great series. If you aren't a perfectionist, it's a watchable series. Just don't expect a 10 star series.",5
"What's not to love about this show? Appealing leads, decent plot twists and good action sequences. Yes, some of the actors are annoying (vice president's daughter should have died for her atrocious acting), and the plot/scenes have some noticeable issues. The President isn't convincing and comes across as a pawn rather than a leader. Same goes for the chief of staff, the casting is a bit questionable at times, but the two leads are watchable. At the heart of it, it's entertaining. If you love action/good fight scenes, a little bit of suspense, and are willing not to look too deeply into the story, you'll love it.",9
"Very entertaining conspiracy thriller in the same vein as Three Days Of The Condor. Yes he should have had more concussions in 10 episodes than a football player gets in a 20 year career, but we want our heroes to be tough and unstoppable. Plus it keeps the action moving since he doesn't waste time in the hospital every episode.Cast has some young good actors mixed in with veterans and character actors that help keep us guessing who to trust and why maybe we shouldn't trust anyone.Some of the NF series have been lagging behind the other streamers lately but this show is very bingeable. A solid thumbs up!",8
For all those who said it was a bad story line obviously didn't watch more then the first 2 episodes. There is some confusion to start with but everything comes together and makes sense great writing to keep you asking questions and wanting to know more. Highly recommend watching it and trust me you will want to go past the first 2 episodes. Truly hoping for a 2nd season. Binge worthy watch each episode makes you want to play the next one. I don't understand how anyone could give this anything less then a eight out of ten. Watch it and make your own conclusions but I think you will agree it is 100% worth watching.,10
Well when something turns up No 1 on Netflix I always get suspicious. It could have been a good series but this is truly bad. Acting is terrible. Where did they find these actors? Plot is full of holes and not very true. It's low budget all the way. I am very disappointed and even more so as they already talk about a season 2. If this is the new way of Netflix future I am very concerned. Usually they make good stuff but this is truly bad. They try to cover it up with even more bad action scenes that look more like an old James Bond movie then something made in the 2022. I think we are passed that moment of old school fighting scenes. Please no more of this.,4
"It's a great stay-inside-thrilling-action marathon worthy series.The acting is really genuine with the two main characters having pretty straightforward differences but important similarities that makes the chemistry natural. It holds together their bond through out the story. Every episode kept me at the edge on my seat and ready to press next.It's filled with both action classic plot twists and turn arounds, but also more unexpected characters and relationships combinations. What I really liked was how you connected with multiple people in the story, not just the main characters!Give it a watch, I'm sure you'll enjoy it!",9
"It's entertaining enough, I suppose, but only if you don't think about it too much or don't pay too close attention to it while watching. Anyone giving this anything above a 7 is out of their minds. Or they don't have minds. You'd have to be borderline braindead to think this is a 10/10.The worst things about the show are the acting and dialogue. Some of the dialogue is so bad that it physically makes me cringe. And when you have dialogue that is that awful, you can't expect the rest of the script/plot to be any better... and it isn't. Just so many plot holes and nonsensical situations, that I don't have enough time or energy to spend writing them all out. If you've watched the first episode or two and are hoping it will get better, then you might as well go ahead and give it up.",6
"I have been involved in the tech startup space for years and loved (finally?) seeing a non-lampooned character.People who succeed in this space are often very smart, super-quick thinkers and tough characters. Rose was a perfect illustration of this.The scenes where Farr is berating much bigger men are great - worth watching again to appreciate how the camera pulls back to see the projection of her anger.As a long-time martial artist, I thought the fight scenes were well also very well done. We didn't see the shaky-cam that's made some of the Bourne movies so annoying.Much of the series is framed with moral ambiguity. How do you know you're on the right side of something? Does a simplistic moral viewpoint mean you let the country down?The pace was engaging. It could maybe have been tightened down to 8 episodes but I didn't feel it was dragged out. (My wife, who's not much of a fan of this genre, thought it was a bit long).",10
"I have just finished it, and I am asking: ""What exactly was the Plot hey had to foil?"" I'm actually not clear.What it did become was a Maze-- who was a Good Guy and who couldn't be Trusted? Endless Good/Bad forks in the road.(best guess: if over 40-- don't Trust, Under 40 -- Trust-- but that is just a rule of guessing)
A Melange of a whole number of shows-- 24, Body Guard, Patriot Games, etc. Heroes having to prove they are not Traitors.Excellent, however, The Women are Smart. Some are even Experts! They take actions on their own, not waiting for Rescue. Finally!!I suspect it makes a much better Binger than a slow and steady-- which would likely result in becoming easily distracted.I wouldn't watch it for the acting. It was adequate.",5
"My husband and I just binged this show over 3 evenings. Wow, this show was good! Oh, sure, I'm sure there are a few plot holes and my willing suspension of disbelief had to be activated. But I do not nitpick a show to death over ""oh, that could never happen"" scoffing. The pace was steady and fast, the characters believable and evoked emotion - some I was rooting for every step, some I despised. The action was great especially for my ""there has to be explosions"" husband. More than once I held my breath hoping that the good guys would prevail. The mystery of why and who ran unanswered all the way to the end. In reviews, I saw comparisons to The Recruit. That's been on the TV while I sat with my husband in the living room but it did not grab me like this show did. Nicely done!",10
"It is a preposterous, yet interesting storyline. I enjoyed the twists and turns and most of the lead characters are good. I did not care for a couple others though. I think this could have been at least 1/3 shorter than it was A little writing could have been tightened up and some fluff removed. Decent job tying it all together at the end.I can't take recommend it but I won't say don't watch it either.I don't know why we need 600 characters for reviews. Is there no value in brevity? Is 600 the limit where IMDb thinks people won't post nonsense, but just give up? Politicians can set the world on fire with 280 characters but I need 600 to convey my opinion of The Night Agent? Weird.",6
"This is a fast moving and fun action series that keeps you engaged. To enjoy it, you cannot be too analytical or expect any logic to how the events unfold. Suffice it to say that events happen only to suit the narrative and keep the action moving along at a rapid pace. Some events lack context, while others seem to be included solely to pad the script and stretch out the time to get it to the required number of episodes. The fight sequences seem to be very ""Kung Fu"" styled, complete with sound effects. From how the first season ends, it's clear that they are hoping to have continuing adventures for a second season. The lead character seems to be a hybrid version of Jack Reacher, 007 and Superman rolled into one!",8
"""The Night Agent"" is yet another Netflix series that begins with an interesting premise, and then devolves into a frustrating and often ridiculous mess. For this type of presidential political thriller to work the action and intrigue needs to be at least somewhat plausible. If you stick around for all 10 episodes you will find yourself saying ""that would never happen"" -- a lot. The bad guys (and gals) are over the top caricatures, eliciting unintentional humor rather dread or fright. Thankfully the good guys and gals are likeable throughout, and the one redeeming quality in the series. There is annoyingly gratituitous cursing throughout, and a sex scene that no one ever, ever needed to see. Editing certainly was not a priority for ""The Night Agent""; this nearly 10-hour overblown mishmash could have been distilled into a couple of hours of relatively good entertainment. But instead what we get is a series that is really no better than the network TV dreck that we're subscribing to Netflix to avoid.",4
"The acting, writing, plot and plot devices are about as basic as you can get. If you have never seen an espionage thriller before then you I direct you to the reviews that are singing this shows praises. If you have, I direct you to the ""honest"" reviews. It's about generic as it gets. It is the opposite of ""24"". Don't let anyone fool you. This is more for the person who thought that ""Designated Survivor "" was quality television. I finished it because it's in my wheelhouse, but it did hurt my brain. I cannot believe this is from the guy who gave us ""The Shield"". Surprised that this isn't on broadcast television. It ticks just about every box that currently passes for entertainment today. My Fellow Americans is way more compelling than this.",1
"Terrible acting, especially the lead? Check. A Swiss cheese of plot holes? Check. Completely unrealistic? Check.But it hums and has action. It knows who it's audience is and it hits that right on target. If you liked Jack Reacher or Jack Ryan with some more speed and more dumb then this is for you. Frankly there is a lack of these types of shoes on TV these days.There are a few bright spots. The assassins are fun characters and Fola Evans-Akingbola is a solid actress.I hope for a season 2 or at least more shows like this on streaming networks. A little smarter with better acting wouldn't hurt.",7
"It was intense & deep. Totally action packed political crime suspense thriller, that doesn't let you move from the screen, even for a single second. Acting skills of every actor was great amd within the role. Doesn't gets boring even for a single second. Like many political thrillers, it was not slow with useless table talks. A combination of political crime within the top institutes and full time action. If someone doesn't want to get bored, this is your watch. Storyline was great too, matched side by side with every character, and every Actor was in depth with their roles, great work!Something worth watching.",10
What a GREAT series ! Binge watched and couldn't stop watching characters were excellent #storyline was great the ending was perfect you already knew you would be watching the second season but it didn't tick you off with an ending you knew you would have to wait to get an answer to. Good suspense good drama great action spy thriller. I highly recommend this series great for a show if you are looking for something to binge watch. The leads and other characters were perfect. Writers directors editors did an awesome job. I will definitely be watching season two and I hope they hurry up and shoot it. I REALLY loved the fact that they didn't jam transgender issues and other politics down our throat just an awesome show suspenseful edge of your seat goodness !!,10
"There are very few redeeming features of this series. The storyline, though with a few twists, is predictable, the characters utterly uni-dimensional, and the acting is stiff at best. There are a few too many nonsensical scenes that defy logic and the action is trite and typical.That being said, if you are able to completely set loose any expectations of quality entertainment and are willing to sit through many hours of suspense that is hardly suspenseful, action that is mostly out of place, and sex that even Disney has a greater capacity to depict and deal with then it is worth a watch. If you, however, prefer good entertainment, keep looking.",3
"I got through an episode and a half before I had to leave. The dialogue was everything I hate about Hollywood. If they had dropped 80% of the dialogue, the actors would have had a chance to strut their stuff. Decent actors but the dialogue completely handicapped them. Really liked Gabriel Basso. I think he could have been great in this sort of vehicle. A couple of the other reviews suggest that it gets better but not sure I can endure even though I do believe the plot/story line is worthy. Note to script writers: allow the audience to contribute. Leave a smidgen of mystery. It will be more engaging and draw your audience in without the 'I'm standing up now' type of dialogue. If the actors can act, you don't need them to say every little detail. That said, there were things I liked about the show. But not quite enough.",5
"What is wrong with US script writers and editors? I'm serious they are all rubbish if you want an honest assessment of their ability to script on theme!This new series started off OK, but within 3 to 4 episodes it was back to the usual banal, human drama rubbish that every single US writer seems to think viewers want! Why is that, what do they think people want to see in a TV series, or is it as I suspect because every single piece of new drama these days has nothing behind it conceptually except a weak kick off idea, followed by a thin plot, supplemented by excessive character development because of the thin plot, shot in cheap motel rooms, at night and fake offices because of the cheap budget and the thin plot....!This is supposedly a spy/political thriller, but most of it starts to revolve around personal relationships.... the VP's daughter and her art teacher, the hired killers frustrated suburban life aspirations blocked by their job, the almost involved female lead with her FBI handler / protector, the female secret service protector of the VP daughter's ms nice gal approach, the old friendship between the female president and her head of staff, etc, etc.For crying out loud take away this rubbish and there's basically zero plot left. I mean some of it is so badly written it makes me want throw up! There was the stupid giggly teenager scene between the male and female lead in a motel bedroom in E3 I think it was that went on for about 5 minutes, then there was the what colour curtain fabric do you like honey in our white picket fence suburbia dream home scene between the two killers, or the my grandma pawned this necklace but my grandpa worked double shifts for 2 years to buy it buy it back but I can lend it to you for tonight scene between the VP daughter and her female secret service protector...... vomit, chunder into the great white China telephone, puke, gag...!Really and this is supposed to be serious entertainment?Acting is also marginal, casting is poor, few of the characters seem real, and most are simply annoying!",3
"I wrote a review of this last night and my phone deleted it, which is just as well, because i may have been harsh. Grateful to have censored myself, here i go again.Rarely do i see a show on tv with such low quality dialogue and writing. Everyone is botox'd and most of the acting and set design and wardrobe here presumes a washington DC archetype, so we get unimaginative and cinematography of bland set designers. Every facet looks second rate, and that could be easily overcome with dynamic and interesting performers, but not here. The lady in the premature gray wig, who somehow THINKS she is stealing every scene, i found uniquely unqualified as an actress. Ditto for the frozen prune-face bald man, ""i am a dc veteran douchebag loudmouth who screams everything."" A lot of audiences might be fooled into thinking both performers are wry and creative, and maybe they really do have skills, but i doubt it. On this material, they are just plain bad and their scenes are excruciating.We have terrible dialogue and it is like acting students workshopping characters in an acting class, but thankfully, we rarely see this level of bad on tv. A Kim kardashian lookalike character named Rose had me yearning for the real Kim in the role...the acting would have been better. I watched the first episode and began the 2nd, but only endured 15 minutes because it felt like torture.I take no delight in ripping anybody's artistic efforts apart, but this show doesnt even rise to the level of TECHNICALLY proficient, i'm afraid. In several areas of industry standards, it seems deficient, and that is a surprising thing to notice when watching tv. Still a lot of viewers might not notice any of this, and enjoy the show in spite of all my observations. There are a lot of car chases and fight scenes and bodies flying thru the air and landing with a thud. People being attacked and strangled/hanged and closeups of their dying, jerking legs and shoes seems to be a mainstay/fad across tv shows nowadays in the '20's. Despite my brief viewing of this show, i saw it 3 different times. It's like the fad of the ski avalanche/snowblind/blizzard or sasquatch/bigfoot storylines across programming that i remember as a kid from the late 70's.The bright spot i found was the lead actor guy, who was the strongest of the lot. With more experience and an actual good director whom we don't have here, he will probably find the perfect role and really shine, but oh my goodness, i am so surprised any network would decide to air any of this.",3
"I really liked this series. I'm usually strictly sci-fi, but I binged this in its entirety, in two nights. The two lead characters, Rose and Peter, felt like an awkward pairing throughout the entire series. He came across a little doofy and she just kind of seemed to be in the way mostly. A few of the actresses saved this show for me though. Hong Chau and Fola Evans-Akingbola played their characters well and really outshined most of the male actors. Diane Farr was the lead character, imo, and stole the show. She was fierce, powerful, unapologetic, leading, mysterious, manipulative and quite dazzling. I loved so much that they chose to have the character have that amazing and beautiful silver hair. Wowza! It really sealed the deal in creating that power look. The show didn't explore Kari Matchett's character (President Travers) as much as I would've liked, so she didn't get as much of a storyline as I think she deserved. This series definitely had me yelling out at the tv quite a few times with some less than par storyline issues, and again, some actors just weren't delivering it for me. There is only one book pertaining to this series that I am aware of, so I would be surprised to see a Season 2, but there is definitely another story there to tell - so hopefully they bring those actresses back to tell it!",10
"If you didn't yell ""VANCOUVER"" at least once early on, you might not be in the right place.This is a budget production straight from Hollywood North, but it serves its mission very well.I'm doubtful there will be a season two, since it appears to be based on a novel and the source material is done.However, the characters could easily be used for another go round if netflix decides to make a go.---I won't say it's perfect. There are plot holes here if you overthink and dialogue is occasionally clunky. But the acting and action kept pulling me forward and I stayed with the binge for the full run.Leads Luciane Buchanan (Rose) and. Gabriel Basso. (Peter) did a good job gaining my sympathy as a viewer and their chemistry worked.Hong Chau (Diane) was probably my favorite character, given the ""is she/isn't she"" tension.Although. Eve Harlow as. Ellen did ""twisted and on the edge"" so well that she deserves a mention, too.---The entire cast took the job seriously and delivered.Yes, it's a budget mini-series. Yes, there are flaws. But I'm still going to re-watch it another run.",9
"To begin, this isn't my genre at all. I happened to see a trailer and decided to pause my 3rd rewatch of The Last Kingdom to check it out.I'm glad I did.Though the plot is solid, the writing can't be rated ""awesome."" The delivery of the lines by all the actors made up for it though. The cast were chosen wisely. They were almost flawless, delivering their lines timely and with the right inflections and emotions.The personal story of Ellen and Dale really didn't do anything for me at all, didn't develop the characters and didn't have any bearing on the overall story. I just found out that this was a novel adaptation, so maybe this just wasn't necessary to the finished product.There was some rule bending, as there is with any and all CIA/FBI stories, so no stars off for that at all. It's not the first series to throw a civilian into the main plot. It was kind of weird that Rose caught onto everything so quickly.It was fast paced. It made you think. It was one of those series where you think you know, only to find out that you don't. I low key suspected Farr wasn't the angel that she seemed to be.I only caught one terrible green screen scene. Dead body, distraught partner/girlfriend. If you've seen it, you know.It was great to see D. B. Woodside (from Lucifer) in this. His character was interesting.Fola Evans-Akingbola's portrayal of Arrington was solid.Overall the series was visually appealing and entertaining. It was worthy of my time and I watched the entire series. I'm hoping for another season, especially when the ending really left everything open to more.With all the current garbage premiering on streaming platforms this one stands apart. Notably absent were all the forced tropes and sociopolitical jabs, making it a welcome and refreshing series.",8
"I would have preferred the ending to include an invitation from The President to both Peter and Rose for night agents. A couple walking down the street draws less attention.If they were less worried about a season two, he should have gotten off the plain. Maybe throw in a pick up and twirl in the air and saying something like ""I was told to keep an eye on you. Kiss and roll credits.I hope a second season is greenlit just to see the duo back together.I binged the series. If were not up to par then I could have moved on. I enjoyed the show even ignoring several goofs. The Vice President resides in The Naval Observatory, and yet Maddie says she is happy to be home while being treated in The White House. Nitpick yes, just an observation of many inaccuracies. Still a good show.",8
"Cringe. It's like the writers took every cliche, put them in a hat and picked them out one by one. The dialogue seems to have been written by a 5 year old who's just read their first Hardy Boys. The characters are wooden and seemingly plucked from the worst of the genre. The plot is as predictable as it is ridiculous. I've read some reviews expressing pity for the actors but they have no excuses as they must have read the script so had every opportunity to realise that this was one to avoid. Netflix normally produce great, clever series but this is just pure mince. Do yourself a favour and steer well clear.",1
"I very much liked the beginning. It was exiting and as a viewer i couldn't wait to skip to the next episode.The performance of the main characters was solid. What i did not like is how quick the situation escalated.The main character (Luciane) that has never been in an environment of shooting or murders, survives an attack at night, a day after she picks up the phone and talks with the agent for hours, not only keeping the line busy but the transition of the movie genre changed very quickly, while on the phone i thought this would turn out to be a love-romantic story.The scenes of the booming and shooting were very unprofessional for a series that would be trending on Netflix.Missing shots 2 meters away? An explosion happening next you while you just had a gun put on the presidents head? And you standing up have a talk with your ""girlfriend"" and the soldiers let you do that... What? What was that?I don't know whether the producer changed while it was being filmed but the transition from ""can't wait to see what happens"" to ""guessing what will happen"" was not what i was looking for.Overall it not the worst.",6
"Only half way through season 1 and already fixated on a season 2. Come Netflix step up and give us a season 2 ... and maybe 3. Great character development, SOLID action and suspense.This is by far the best new series I have discovered in MONTHS. If you enjoy cop shows, FBI and all types of secret service, good guy vs bad guy this might just be up your alley.Night Agent is a great popcorn and soda night out feel about it and keeps your mind active about who dun it and what could possibly happen next.More streaming services could benefit from more knuckles like Night Agent.Come on give us more!",10
"The story was decent albeit having a few questionable plot devices. But the acting was really par at best with the exception of the lead female (Rose) who was good. But most of the main cast called it in or just aren't that good.It's true the cast were unknowns for the most part but it's hard to believe 90% of them were that bad, so I have to look to the direction, too.I don't mind an unknown cast. I they can act and the story is good, who cares, but in this case there might be a reason they are lesser known.So most characters were wooden while one over acted (the VP's daughter). Again, it might all fall onto the director.",8
"The old patriotic formula repeated exhaustively of terrorism, attack against the American president, corrupt politicians and agents, shootings, car chases, etc. Added to all this a group of second-rate actors, several plot holes and badly done action scenes, the result should be the worst possible, but it is not. The point is that the plot in general holds attention, the direction is competent and we end up getting involved with the characters.An improvement on the plot holes and on some implausible solutions forced into some scenes, as well as a better choice of actors, would have given this show a considerable upgrade, but it's still a good pastime for those who aren't too demanding. The main couple of actors exaggerates too much in their acting in my opinion, they make a lot of faces, mouths and grimaces, they follow a hammy school of acting that I don't know how there are still people who appreciate it nowadays. Acting is acting soberly and truthfully, not making faces and overacting, at least in my view.But this series in not unwatchable, you can pass your time time in a good way if you like the theme and you are not too demanding.Rate 5.5 out of 10.",6
"When you start groaning and then laughing in the first fifteen minutes...it's not the reaction an espionage thriller is supposed to illicit.The story line/writing is unbelievable in any sense of the word. A video game has more believable elements than this. There are plenty of shows where you have to suspend reality, but this requires not only suspending reality but removing it completely. The acting is wooden, and the bad guys fairly scream ""Don't trust me I'm a sociopath"" yet they easily get what they want, and of course have to garrote people to show the audience that they are really truly bad. We have a saying for shows like this, ""it's like getting hit with a stupid stick throughout the show""..This one is a log.",2
"It's exciting. There's lots of action, twists and turns and on yeah, it's fun! Just go with it! If on the other hand you are a secret service, FBI, CIA, special forces expert or a wanna be expert, with a critical eye for all secret or covert US and World government operations...well how about you just watch a documentary or read a training manual or something. Anything you watch won't be real enough for you.Yes there are parts of the story that require a little bit of a ""well sure, why not?"" kind of attitude. Is that so hard? Really? Have you seen any of the world and US events lately? Truth IS stranger than ""Night Agent"" by a country mile.Looking forward to what comes next Netflix. I'll gladly binge watch season 2,3,4 ...",9
"It was predictable and then unpredictable then boring- unrealistic. It took 7 episodes until both of them make out. Haha. Once you watch it you gotta finish it 10 episodes long thank God. Acting wasn't bad but storyline is so hectic and pretty much you can guess who the traitor is (the bad guy acting bad will definitely not be a traitor and the good one acting real helpful and trusting is always gonna be the one thats gonna f u up.) its very meh- i actually have 1 more episode to go but it felt like i wasted 2 nights for a medicore limited series. I like the villains though- good acting, got me spooked.",4
"Fun escapism. Kudos to the writers and developers for not falling into the pitfalls of many of these multi episode Netflix type of shows. Maybe they read are reviews? First the male and female protagonist were likable, good looking, got along without spending a lot of time fighting about stupid stuff, and they both participated fully in the quiet moments and action throughout the story. They also didn't jump into bed during the first episode but after their characters were well developed, several episodes later, and in fact, they stopped making out cause of his wounds, and we assume that they did finally jump in to bed with each other, but it makes for a show that can be watched by all.Episodes were not wasted on hour long inconsequential flashbacks. At the beginning of each episode there was a flashback that lasted a few minutes. The flashbacks were focus on the storyline, and assisted the story.Of course there was A lot of implausible situations with FBI service, Secret Service, hacking White House data, etc. But who cares. In fact, after Trump's reign, some of these situations might not be that implausible. This was just fun entertainment. Everybody semi-knows who the bad guys are and the outcome, but it was still a surprise. So spend a couple evenings or a weekend and sit back and enjoy yourself.",8
"Highly addicting! I love the plot to this show,. It keeps you on your toes.. there is alot to follow along with, so you cant just have it playing in the background, you really have to pay attention to who's who and what's going on, but that is what makes it good! I love the two main characters, who eventually start to fall for each other. Peter is super hott! Hehe..
yeah but it is a refreshing show, it actually has a plot, unlike most shows nowdays, they all just have no point to it, but this show def does! It is one of the top shows on Netflix as of right now, thats how i stumbled upon it. But yeah!!! Totally Def recommend it!",10
"The Night Agent is kind of a strange one.Two main stars do try hard, fuse well, and are very charming. Their acting works for most of the time, although there are blunders every now and then. The filming, the photography, the audio and the setting is all very well done. And for a thriller, it has quite solid pace and very little of boring fluff. It feels like a quality product in most aspects.On the other hand, there's a big, gaping problem with this show. I don't know how else to put it... but that the writer of the show simply wasn't very intelligent person.A spy thriller needs to be spot on with weapons and tactics, tradecraft and psychological portrayal of people who work for the FBI, Secret Service, The White House, and so forth. The writer of such show must have deep understanding the sort of people who do this.And this doesn't really happen in The Night Agent. Most cutthroat, cynical, sane and rational branches of government, agencies, and people who work there are portrayed in some sort of dumbed-down, weird, semi-jingoistic and family-friendly manner. Sort of like show ""24"" if it was re-shot by Disney and rated PG-13. Everyone comes off as a clueless civilian, messy politician or a honor boy scout, while the villains are straightforwardly cartoonish and inept.Same goes for ""action"" - the guns sound wrong, the explosions are your classic movie petrol fireballs, the ""tracking devices"" have huge blinking lights visible from low earth orbit, the ""hacking"" is mostly messing around in Windows Command Prompt and so forth. It's also kind of amusing to see a ""hacker and cybersecurity expert"" spending days without touching a computer.And, while it feels like there's a lot of action, there really isn't, it's more of the ""oh no!"" moments like in ""Ozark"" or ""Breaking Bad"". Actual body count is extremely low and shooting-chasing is pretty poor, so it's still mostly a show about talking heads. That said, the ""oh no"" stuff is still pretty well done, so you get at least a good illusion of pace and urgency.Also, the people chosen to be cast in this movie all look *really* weird. It's like the audition was called out to find and throw together most strange-looking humans on the planet. I wonder what was the general idea behind this, some sort of misled diversity attempt? It leaves quite strange and cartoony vibe.While couple people who you'd actually expect to work in those government jobs - middle-aged white men and women - look so unmemorable that I couldn't tell them apart even after watching all 10 episodes, even though they were somewhat important heads of various services and such.Thus, compared to any other movie or show who got this cold, dark and professional environment more or less right - like ""Homeland"", better seasons of ""24"" or the movie ""Mile 22"", ""The Night Agent"" falls incredibly flat. I feel like just watching this made me dumber.First two episodes are kind of interesting, and then it starts rolling down the hill till the end.So... while it's well-made and generally watchable, it's definitely not brilliant nor memorable. It's dumb, family-friendly and campy like ""Blacklist"" or ""Designated Survivor"", with some of extra needless quirks added. Make of it what you will. A tale of mediocrity, I guess.",5
"The actor playing Peter Sutherland is a solid actor and plays his role well and believable.Sadly he is held back by a disastrous performance of the lady playing the 'grieving' computer genius. I wrote 'grieving' because she never spills one single tear after the death of the two most important people in her life who raised her.Her facial expression is always exactly the same as if frozen in place; the entitled angry look (so familair in current day cinema sadly). It really doesn't matter which scene she has to play; sad, in love, happy, depressed; just 1 single look forever etched on her face.And then the plot and writing. Ouch. The lady, who needs protection because murderers are (for some reason) after her, is simply everywhere. She can't be shaken lose. Instead of hiding her somewhere she follows the hero of the story around like a spoilt all-knowing puppy.And the plot goes from coincidence via stupid decision to Deus machina via stupid decidion to coincidence.It's actually quite is disheartening because this kind of escapism is what people actually crave. We really need better writers and a main character that can actually act.That said; the majority of the supporting cast was not too bad. They deserve a better writer.Again; Netflix cancelled Mindhunter, a mature, intelligent show with brilliant actors. Loved by critics and the audience alike and decided to gave us this. Bizarre.",4
"I love action shows like 24 or Jack Ryan, but the issue about this genre is that there are usually a lot of turnovers and sub-plots and action that might overload the public, which in the middle doesn't recall how they even began. On the other side, we have low paced shows like Homeland, which might be ""boring"". What impressed me about this show is that it has the perfect balance between pace and action, it only focuses on 1 issue, it has some action and also some drama so we can get to know the characters, so it's never boring and it's never to overloaded with an excessive amount of plot twists that might get the public lost. Also, it's original and interesting!",9
"I laugh in the middle of 2 episode!The acting is so bad. The plot is the most easy thing to guess. I'm in the second episode (yes second) and i already know who his the bad guys and good guys.Its pathetic. Who in netflix board is approving thiss rubbish? Spending money like this on pathetic series that tell over and over the same thing: USA is in danger, secret agent on the run with a witness, the person that is trying to help him is actually the bad guy that dont want him to discover the truth.Give us a break please, looolOne of the bad the guys, enters in the room screams (after she didnt got to kill her target) and says ""i hate to loose"". Really? Looool.",1
"The show starts off well, but then descends into some mediocre tropes and storytelling, as well as a noticeable drop in production quality in the middle episodes, like a low-budget, made-for-network-TV feel, replete will woke actors/characters.If you stopped there, you might have a poor impression of the show. If you hang in there until the second half of the season (perhaps the last third?), the show really picks up steam, with good twists and improvements all around, including acting, action, dialog, and even some special effects.This show isn't going to wow anyone, but does manage pull off a nice landing. Second season is already greenlit, and for those who stuck with the show, I'm sure you'll look forward to where the story goes, though it risks becoming a forgettable generic spy thriller.",7
"The Writer of the show, Shaw. Ryan. Almost ruined this show with his ridiculous plot holes. They're really too many to list. He definitely bit off more than he could chew with this series. It has so much potential, though, and much of it was wasted with the unrealistic scenarios playing out in each episode. He had the budget, obviously, and the show is ultimately watchable, but you have to be willing to ignore too many errors to get through it. It could have been so much better, a top tier spy series, on par with 'the recruit' had they consulted professional advisers instead of Ryan doing all his researching of government security procedures on wikipedia alone.",3
"Take elements of The Fugitive (distinctive tattoo instead of one-armed man), The Bodyguard (unlikely coupling of cop and victim on the run from bad guys), any of a dozen identical White House corruption thrillers and a smattering of Killing Eve (jolly music in the killing scenes) and blend until the whole lot turns to treacle.In the first few minutes, when the heroine's uncle and aunt (secret agents) are brutally murdered and she's rescued from the house, her first words are not despair, anger, fear or terror. 'But everyone loved them,' she says, one of the most idiotic, unintentionally hilarious lines in any TV show in years.Watching all ten episodes of this would be like repeat visits to a clumsy dentist. Even one will put your teeth on edge.",1
"...then it's not a bad watch. But the Basso as the lead talks like he has a dip of snuff under his upper lip. And if Dejardines doesn't get into crying mode she is ok. But the worst actor is Chau who seems to be clueless. Some issues that don't make sense. The two assassins move into a vacant house and the neighbors don't call the cops even though the lights are on at night. I doubt the people left town who owned the house without letting their neighbors know. Then the assassins run around in the same car for most of the series without any cops being on the lookout for it since they know the plates. A typical trope where the spoiled rich girl sneaks out on her security detail only to be kidnapped. For once you would think they would find another plot device that is not so worn. Other issues--too much time spent on the backstories when they would become evident if the current timeline kept rolling. And as an ""expert counterintelligence"" operative, sort of dumb for Basso to hang out on his godfather's boat. Last one; with time running out and less that 3 minutes before the bomb goes off Sutherland decides to get into a fistfight with the bad guy even though he has a gun. Uh, maybe shooting the bad guy wn the wiser choice.",6
"Half of one, really. Nothing makes any sense at any point, unless this has been written specifically in order to fill this up with as many clichés as possible.It seems like every other line in the script is a roll of the dice, with the writer(s) hoping that whomever is watching will be exhausted enough not to realize how completely idiotic all of this is.The pace is off, the dialogues are empty and genuinely stupid, the White Knight seems to be able to walk off 6 concussions an hour with no major difficulty, the Damsel in distress is unbearable, and 99% of the decisions the characters make are designed to move the story forward without any concern for coherence or basic intelligence.Half an hour of my life I won't get back.",1
"Unfortunately, this isn't one of them. It started out ok in eipsode 1 and not to far in saw where it was going to start to slide over the cliff. I've showed more emotion when I've lost my car keys in the house then she showed after the death of this beloved aunt and uncle. Just another night I guess. Oh well, off with the hunky, cute agent.Where it fully was sliding down the hill....he's the Night Agent. Special phone in the White House to answer special calls for help from agents. Yet they can chat on the phone like they just had a great first date. Really hope nobody needed anything while they were chatting. I knew then this was not going to get any better. Give me MI, Jack Ryan and Jason Bourne instead anyday!",4
"It's an ok watch, but don't have high expectations when it comes to the writing, plot , or acting.Plot is as cliché as you can get, but again, it's still entairtaning.I'm a little confused with the casting of the lead actor too, is he good looking? Sure. But nothing to make up for his acting, it's pretty bad... I'm not sure how he made it this far in the business, is there a nepotism situation going on or something?That being said, I'd still recommend the show if you want something fun and mindless to watch. If you start taking this show seriously, it's not a good show though, so depends on how you go about it.",6
"The script was a lazy cliche of the worst thrillers, and wasn't helped by a cast that were mostly out of their depth. It reminds me of the cheesy thrillers of the 70's. And yet, I did want to stick around and find out how it would play out. As I suspected, it was very predictable. The script and plot lacked the maturity and creativity of what we are now seeing regularly in European thrillers. At times it was embarrassing. Cringe tv.The casting was terrible with some actors playing roles they were always going to be unbelievable in.I think younger audiences may enjoy it, particularly if they haven't been spoiled with anyhalf decent comparison from across the pond.",3
"I watched the trailer and it seemed pretty good so decided to watch the show. I was pleasantly surprised how entertaining it was.Not a world-class piece of drama but just good suspenseful and entertaining, good guy versus bad guy; good guy trying to clear his name sort of spy show.I also couldn't shake why I felt that I had seen the cute actress playing Rose before, but couldn't put my finger on it.I finally came here and looked her up and I realized she's the one who played female monk Tripptaca, in the Netflix series a few years ago. I really like your character in the show and she's a hundred times much better looking with long hair.",8
"This was a good watch. But, seriously, what's with all of the ""f"" word in almost every single sentence. I know people use foul language all the time, but it usually comes from people with a limited vocabulary and maybe not the highest intelligence. But these are supposed to be people with an education and who are quick thinking...and all they can come up with is ""f"" this and that??? It's just poor writing; it's unimaginative from the get go!!Most of the acting was good. I do hope they can do some creative work and come up with a second season. As always, reality was left at the door involving proper FBI and Secret Service protocols.",9
First of all I can see it had a chance to be a good show. Who ever picked the leads did a terrible job. Peter is too much of a nerd to play his part and rose is not very good either. Rose is not good and should have been knocked off in the first episode. Guess they were desperate in getting leads for this show. I like the supporting actors and like I said it could be a good show with different leads. Good action overall and the plot is well written. Next time I will try to be more open minded about the acting but when those two are the leads it's hard to do. Bottom line if you can get past these two non actors you may enjoy this show.,4
"If you're one of those people who consistently looks down their nose at others works then you'll probably do the same with this. If you need to binge something to unwind, or need a decent distraction I highly recommend this. Great pacing, has a real Tom Clancy feel to it. It never felt rushed or like dragged out. I hate when shows start feeling like work to get through, this was highly enjoyable. The ending was great as well, not a huge cliffhanger like alot of other shows, but I could definitely see a season 2. Like everything else in this world, everyone has an opinion, mine is give it a shot and form your own opinion ?? Cheers ??",9
"Regardless of all the so-so reviews I enjoyed watching it. I was entertained cast did a great job, some of the twist were totally unexpected. Have to pay attention in order to keep track of the story line as it changes a few times. Good show different. Does not have to be real world, just hold my attention, just keep me interested in trying to figure out the who done it. Just watch it and don't be to critical... looking forward to a new season.Also I like the way the cast was matched up.I need 96 more characters to send this comment so I'm wasting space. Hope you will enjoy watching with out judgement.",10
"Gratuitous profanity. Adds nothing to the story, character development or quality of the drama. There's so much of it that it's lost as a way to show emotion or drama. So much it's unbelievable. Especially in the first episodes the scenes are repetitive and predictable. A show that follows a tradition pattern is ok. The challenge is making it great and this show fails. Scenes mimick other shows, e.g. The shootout in the container farm. Really? Chief of Staff tried hard, especially under that phony wig, but she never became believable. The two main characters were very likeable, but the chemistry was created by her. He never got out of his Christian Jock role. I admit, I stayed with it and watched the whole thing. If I'd had something in reserve I would have quit, but it kept me from picking up my book. For season 2 I hope first for better writing and acting good enough to break free from the predictable plot line and find the magic of a good ensemble.",5
"After 2 episodes, I'm convinced that the Night Agent is the product of a primitive version of ChatGPT. The plot is scraped from a variety of better movies (Three Days of the Condor, The Parallax View, War Games) and reduced to the lowest level of plausibility, and the dialogue sounds as if written by a robot whose first language isn't English. I do have to admire a commitment to non-traditional casting that would not only cast a variety of non-US actors as Americans, but have a Chinese actor play a character who'd never heard of pu-erh tea. A lot of the budget did wind up on the screen, though.",3
"... but very entertaining and suspenseful. Of course we have seen some of the ideas and elements of ""The Night Agent"", but doesn't that apply to almost all the stuff we get to see nowadays? Apart from that, innovative series can be very boring so that innovation alone doesn't make a masterpiece. Despite some cliches, I liked most of the actors and the plot so that I think that ""The Night Agent"" is well worth watching for everybody who likes this kind of genre (conspiracy thriller/ drama). I'm looking forward to the second season! The number of required characters, by the way, has prevented me from writing anything quite a few times...",8
"I finished the whole series in ONE NIGHT! That says a lot as I easily get distracted when watching TV shows.I can honestly say that this is one of the best Netflix originals I've seen in a long long time.Hong Chau is an excellent actress, she is amazing! Luciane Buchanan is a star, great acting and just effortlessly natural, the sarcastic moments between Rose and Peter are so silly and cute (I need more). I'm glad that her character portrays such a strong individual with a goal in mind that she wants to pursue till the end.I appreciate the slow burn between Rose and Peter, it develops so naturally. The little looks they give each other and how they make fun of each other put a smile on my face every time (I appreciate that it's not cringey). The scene when Rose explains old people in a restaurant is just so sweet. I hope to see more of their love in future seasons, just so so cute!! Even though Peter is the main character but having Rose really makes this series complete.On to the plot, the writers did a great job, it was truly thrilling for me to watch and I couldn't stop till I saw what happened next. However, I did find Fola's acting as Arrington seemed a bit awkward at times.Sony and Netflix, amazing job on this series and cannot wait for many more seasons to develop soon!",10
"The acting is great and screenplay too. The way the plot unfolds is also very nice.I am disturbed about the directorial issues. Too many unrealistic issues that could have been easily avoided.Few examples,
S1 E9 - Why would anyone bandage a wound OVER someones clothes? Why would anyone have blood on their hands to wash off at their house, from a shooting that took place arlier in the day. As soon as the paramedics came, hands would have been cleaned...OBVIOUSLY.These are just TWO of the issues that are amidst a whole lot more. It is starting to make the series irritating to watch, while the basic storyline is great.",7
"Firstly, I'm glad this was a series because the characters are so strong and versatile you want to spend as much time as you can getting to know them, where as a film it would be limited to cram all in.I've never heard of Basso until now, and I hope I continue to see more of him. I really enjoyed his performance of Peter. He delivers this character with a mix of strength and sensitivity. He is a charachter you know deserves more than the cards he's being dealt, and your kinda glad the phone that is never suppose to ring, rings on bi's shift because you know that's when things are going to get exciting.I also really enjoyed Hong chau's character Diane, who is a mighty powerhouse, with a sharp tongue and a woman who has it all together..or so you think. Buchanans charachter Rose, was so refreshing to see.I like that they casted a petite woman with dark hair as opposed to the usual leads of a white blonde hair woman, which can get a tad boring.Her charachterr is also strong. The fact that she is CEO of a computer company, and is rather technical puts a fresh new twist on the female lead, rather than just being the damsel who is saved in every situation by the man, they both equally save eachother in messy scenarios that they encounter along the way.It reminds me of noughties action blockbusters days that I thought where long gone in this day and age of TV. I feel it likened to Will Smith in Enemy of the state or Chris Evans in Cellular but with it respectively being its own unique show.The stunts are great, lots of shooting, glass smashing and high speed car chases. And even though its set in D. C. i feel like this journey took them all around the country, from being in car chases in suburban city areas to on foot getaways in the woodland, then fighting sequences taking place in derelict yards. Jumping from one location to another really helps with the electric pace of this series. Theirs no way you could press pause and save and continue watching for another day. It's all in to the end, even If you sacrifice your sleep.",9
"""The Night Agent"" is a television series that promises an action-packed thriller with a story that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Unfortunately, it falls short of those expectations with a mediocre storyline that most of the time does not make sense. The show revolves around an FBI agent who discovers a conspiracy involving the White House key staff and FBI director that threatens to undermine the United States' security.The show's premise is intriguing. However, the execution of the storyline leaves much to be desired. The plot is often convoluted and confusing, with many of the events not making sense or seeming to come out of nowhere. The writing seems rushed and poorly thought out, leaving the viewer feeling unsatisfied with the resolution of many of the story's threads.One of the most significant issues with the show is the acting. Unfortunately, most of the cast's performances are underwhelming, with little nuance or depth to their portrayals. The actors' inability to convey the emotional weight of the situations they find themselves in leaves the show feeling flat and unengaging. Many of the actors' line deliveries feel wooden and stilted, making it difficult to become invested in the characters' fates.There are a few standout performances, however. Eve Harlow, who plays the psycho villain, delivers an engaging and convincing portrayal of a woman on the brink of madness. Her performance stands out as one of the few bright spots in an otherwise lackluster cast. Unfortunately, her character is not enough to carry the show on its own.Another issue with ""The Night Agent"" is its pacing. The show moves at a breakneck speed, often jumping from one plot point to the next without giving the viewer time to process what's happening. The result is a show that feels disjointed and rushed, leaving the viewer feeling unsatisfied and confused.Despite its flaws, ""The Night Agent"" does have some redeeming qualities. The show's action sequences are well-executed and exciting, providing some much-needed energy to the series. The fight scenes are choreographed well, and the cinematography is solid, making these moments some of the most enjoyable in the show.In conclusion, ""The Night Agent"" is a show that promises an action-packed thriller but ultimately falls short of those expectations. Its mediocre storyline and poor acting make it difficult to become invested in the characters or the plot. While there are some standout moments, they are not enough to save the show from feeling disjointed and rushed. If you're looking for a fast-paced action series, ""The Night Agent"" may be worth a watch, but if you're looking for a well-written and well-acted thriller, there are better options out there.",6
"Some good entertainment in this series, but some terrible acting let it down, Diane Farr is so unbelievable it's bizarre, probably not the actress fault as she is dressed up like a Bond villain , as long you can shut that out of your mind it bumbles along in a good misdirection kinda way with you second guessing what's going on. Def worth a watch , and some really good characters in the rest of the cast especially ""Agent Monks"" he should have a series all of his own :)
The lead characters are good and certainly stand out to make the story believable and exciting enough, just a shame some production decisions seem to let it down.",8
"This movie is all about our beloved government being very bad. There are spies everywhere and no one can be trusted. It's the deep state plotting to overthrow others within the government. Although many movies have had a similar theme, there's a different story here to enjoy and appreciate. Photography is great, watch DC in low light, cloudy most time, it's as if you are there with the characters. Coming to characters all are almost unknown. Despite the great story and having Sony pictures in the production, the budget must have been sufficiently low to prevent recruiting of good actors. The lead female character Lucianne Buchanan looks abnormal, with large eyes almost like she has thyroid problems. You'll have to tolerate her looks through out the 10 episodes. The male lead Gabriel Basso also not well known performs very well.",7
"The plot is not unique. From the very beginning, the series reminded me of Apple Thriller Series 'Slow Horses'. It was good to see that the genre is now shifting to it's attention to domestic terrorists. Definitely a slight turn against framing foreign lands and people as criminals in the post 9/11 security paradigm. A Muslim terrorist was there, by the way. The series started on a wrong foot - the bomber was wearing a hoodie. I mean, come on. How hard it was to debunk the common myth that people wearing hoodies are suspicious? The weakest part of the whole series was President's Chief of Staff Dianne Farr and the President herself. Farr had a central role to play and she enjoyed so much screen time. Yet her expression was mostly bland and robotic. Of the ten episodes, she only did well in two scenes. It was painful to watch. And Farr's character was developed poorly too. As the Chief of Staff of the President of the United States, she seemed to have no busyness at all. Same goes for the president. Could be much more better. The main actor, actress, and VP's daughter stole the show. As I said it was a good blend of good and bad actors.",9
"There is so much wrong with this show. Terrible plot with so many impossibilities and dumb behavior (like an FBI agent trying to use the elevator when the power is out...honestly). The dialogue is extremely flat and so is the actors' delivery. Everyone talks in monotone, it's almost comical. It's a shame that Netflix keeps trying to make new shows and cancels existing ones that actually have something to them. I was shocked to find so many 10/10 reviews here but everyone's entitled to their opinion. This is mine. Please save yourself the 10 hours and do not watch. I had to stop midway through episode 4.",2
"I think the show was put together really well. The actors in the leading roles appeared to be natural in their characters, probably what made the show work. The writing may steer things a little too conveniently for the path they want it to go, but definitely not more so than many long running shows. And the corny lines are very minimal, which is an anomaly now days.Overall, it hits in an area where shows have been lacking recently. If only it moves into the 2nd season keeping a similar feel and does not try to over do itself or reach too far to keep all the same characters it will be a strong show for some time to come.",9
"'The Night Agent' is a thrilling and dramatic series that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The show follows FBI agent Peter Sutherland as he investigates a complex conspiracy that threatens to destabilize the US government. The lead actor delivers an excellent performance, portraying Peter as a determined and capable agent who is willing to take risks to get the job done.While the show is primarily a thriller with plenty of action scenes and plot twists, it also includes elements of drama that add emotional weight to the story. From the personal struggles of the characters to the high stakes of the investigation, 'The Night Agent' keeps you invested in the story and the fates of its characters. Overall, it's a must-watch for fans of the thriller and drama genres, and a great choice for anyone looking for a well-written and well-acted series on Netflix.",10
"This could have been a great action story, but the acting is so bad it is distracting. The lines are delivered woodenly and without any believability. The only ones that deliver at all are Eve Harlow as Ellen. The worst is Hong Chau as Diane Farr, who must be the most boring actress I've watched in a long time. She gives al her lines completely deadpan. Boring. You really have to suspend belief to watch it, since the ridiculousness of the plot holes are too numerous to count. Too bad, it could have been an interesting show if they had just tried a little harder. I watch shows to be entertained, and normally don't care about plot angles, but this show is just silly.",4
"Netflix series. In a world where we can't trust anyone, rose calls the hotline that's reserved for undercover fbi operatives or informants. She's on the run, when her aunt and uncle are knocked off. And so far, she only trusts peter and his direct boss agent farr. Everyone else is a question mark. Who is bombing random subways? They hide. And run. And try to clear their own names. But of course, the people they thought they could trust ...are trying to frame them. Where can they go? And the conspiracy goes all the way to the white house. Good suspense! And according to several sites, it will be renewed for another set of episodes. Good stuff! Gabriel basso, luciane buchanan. Definitely worth watching.",8
"There has been such a minimal amount of good shows ever since COVID. I didn't go into this show with high expectations. I thought it would be low quality, slow, nothing to remember, but I was pleasantly surprised! It's not necessarily a high caliber series, but it's very entertaining. Not a single episode fell flat or was slow/boring. It was high paced and kept you guessing. Don't go in expecting it to compare to the best series of the year, but it's wonderful in its own category. I loved the mystery, action, and storyline. There were so many times I expected the ""villain"" to be X, and then I would second guess myself. Figuring out the puzzle was the best part. Highly recommend binging this on your off day!",8
"I'll try and do this without spoiling anything, but the main message here is that this is show is unsuccessfully trying to capitalize on the success of shows like Jack Ryan and Reacher. The first few episodes start out by giving you enough mystery and intrigue to be engaged (if you suspend some disbelief and logic) but ultimately the show gets a bit ridiculous.While there are some good characters (the main duo is fun to watch, has good chemistry, and you really root for them) at some point the writing goes a bit off the rails and becomes pretty unbelievable. Basically, the writer or writers of this show are good at dialogue writing but not very good at fleshing out the big picture logic and circumstance that would make this a good spy thriller.I am basically just posting this review to say I would not recommend starting this because it has a decent enough of a hook to keep you watching and the payoff really isn't worth it. Around episode 7 things start to get really unbelievable and that continues throughout the rest of the series. Pretty well made though with some decent acting, storylines, and dialogue. Just the motivations of the characters are very one-sided and not fleshed out at all, and a lot of it simply does not make any sense.",7
"I'm four episodes in and hooked - The Night Agent is a proper thriller - good action, good tension, characters you get to know and a well concealed motive behind the shady dealings of some people who are clearly utterly ruthless.It all adds up to a satisfying action spy thriller - more Jack Ryan than Slow Horses - definitely a good watch that will lift your adrenaline levels.With six episodes to go I imagine there are still quite a few surprises to be had before things become clear and we know who's doing what, and where and why.At the core of what makes the show work is the time spent allowing characters to communicate - this isn't just about short 15 to 20 second scenes that establish no real continuity and don't allow us to get to know the characters - and the dialogue is pretty good, the script has been well worked on.Coupled with this, a great ensemble, high production values (including some good stunt work), slick cinematography.A well deserved 8.",8
"Yes in parts it's a little cliched, however this has definitely gone under the radar.It's a great watch from the outset with plenty of twists and turns along the way. It's a rollercoaster from the outset with bangs, high action, mystery and deceit.It's one of those shows, that should a season 2 that is equally as good, this is going to pick up major traction.It's got no actors that jump out as being ""major"" when you look at the cast list. Again, don't let that put you off. I'd imagine some of them will star in other shows, which will again lead people back to watching this.All in all, a solid 9/10.",9
"Really enjoyed the show. Kept moving and the performances were solid. I did do a double take when the ""former navy seal"" couldn't do a believable crawl through the pool. It was the first unbelievable moment i caught. Otherwise, anything from Sean Ryan gonna get my attention. He's created some great shows, as have the writers that came up on his vehicles. He is a guy I'd watch anytime. The Shield is one of my favorites. They used a few of Ryan's Directors on this show. If Adam Arkin is directing, and he is, you know the scripts are good. Again?, I'm glad I found it. The talent is strong. DB Woodside is a great actor, love his work. He can do it all.",8
"If you're a fan of action-packed, suspenseful shows, then ""The Night Agent"" on Netflix is a must-watch. Based on the character Peter, this new show is a total 10/10 in my books.From the very first episode, ""The Night Agent"" had me on the edge of my seat. The plot is gripping, with plenty of twists and turns that keep you guessing until the very end. I won't give anything away, but let's just say that Peter's character goes through some intense experiences that make for incredibly exciting viewing.The action sequences in this show are also top-notch. I was blown away by the fight scenes, which are choreographed to perfection. Each one is so well-executed that I felt like I was right there in the middle of the action.But ""The Night Agent"" isn't all about action. There's also a lot of suspense and mystery that keeps you hooked. As the plot unfolds, you're constantly left wondering who to trust and what's really going on behind the scenes. This is the kind of show that keeps you up late at night, trying to figure out what's going to happen next.Overall, I have to say that ""The Night Agent"" is a total winner. If you're a fan of action, suspense, and mystery, then this is definitely a show you won't want to miss. It's a 10/10 in my books.",10
"The first five episodes are frustratingly generic, with one-dimensional stock genre characters and a bag of cliches. The writing was poor, with the FBI trained protagonist showing little security consciousness and surviving through pure luck.Actually the only refreshing element that offers something different is the love story between the assassins.The female characters are particularly poorly drawn - the female lead, the Secret Service agent, and the VP's daughter in particular - where arrogance and rudeness seem to substitute for strength and sass; they behave like entitled teenagers and are plain unlikeable.Thank goodness for Oscar-nominated actress Hong Chau, who transforms herself yet again and brings some class to the proceedings.From episode 6 the action picks up pace and the characters start to become more fleshed out (a bit late), and the show becomes more engaging (and less annoying).There's not much chemistry between the two leads, so the romance side plot seems a bit forced (the assassins romance is better!).The show seems to have done well. So if there's a second season, hope it continues to improve, particularly on the writing.",6
"The Night Agent is an incredibly disappointing TV series that fails to deliver on its potential. The show is a jumbled mess of uninteresting characters, stilted dialogue, and confusing plotlines that make it difficult to follow. There is no clear direction, and the story seems to ramble on without any real purpose or meaning.The acting in this show is subpar, with wooden performances and very little chemistry between the characters. The main character is particularly bland, lacking any real depth or complexity. The supporting cast doesn't fare any better, and their performances feel forced and uninspired.The most frustrating thing about The Night Agent is that it had the potential to be great. The premise was intriguing, and the show had a lot of promise. However, the execution falls short, and it ends up feeling like a wasted opportunity. The pacing is slow, and the story seems to drag on endlessly without any real payoff.Overall, The Night Agent is a forgettable TV show that is not worth your time. There are better options out there if you're looking for a well-crafted and engaging thriller.",1
"It's ok.Show a sequence of fat32 formatting an encrypted drive then proclaiming ""this is super spy levels of encryption, we need a super computer to break in to it"".. The tech consult should be fired. A tiny video camera with unlimited battery. NSA up the wazoo level assassination of high level governmental family members, but no satellite tracking.Also what's with all the lisps?!Rose, the female assassin, the chief of staff, the VPs daughter... Why can no one speak in this show, it's like their jaws are weird shut?There's an awful lot of boss babes in this one.I'm starting to have to skip ahead frequently just to see what happens.",6
"Basso and Buchanan must be very good actors to manage the poorly written dialogue the way they do, though I do think the supporting characters have the most expository and cliched dialogue to work with, so that may be unfair. That said, despite the ridiculousness of the storyline and the headache-inducing dialogue, the story is really compelling. I find myself very interested in seeing what happens next. It's a good, entertaining show that would benefit greatly from a dialogue coach and a good writer to tune it up.I'd also tone down the random bursts of profanity that seem dropped in for no reason and don't mesh with the characters who use it. They also need better wigs. Fake hair is distracting.",7
"By modern standards this show isn't horribly. To be clear, I'm not saying this is a great show, but considering the state of the modern entertainment industry, it's watchable. The writing is barely passable, although the characters are all cliché and the plot is predictable. It's more like rewatching a show you've already seen instead of watching something new. The acting and directing are acceptable, not great, but acceptable. There's too much sex and violence. I think writers fall back on those tropes when they can't think of anything else. They didn't have enough story to fill up the episodes so they threw in a few fights and some sex to fill in time. If you are looking for something mindless to watch while you play a video game, this show is an acceptable option.",3
"I'll keep this simple, smart ass girl try to take everything under control, and the agent that god know why he is not that professional. Wandering around just like another american series that put too much addtional story. Make it a series maybe to much for a story that actually able to pack it in less episode or just make it movie.The action good, the pace quite good. The story good also for the first 2 episode. The mistery and reason that keept secret and slowly open up is good point from me.Lol the agent that suppose to be invincible turns out just like another kid with daddy issues.Too much drama for anyone that expect pure action and mistery for a really secret plot story.",6
"Every single male in this show is talked down to in all dialogues. Every single person in charge is you guessed it .. a female. The storyline is pretty interesting though, enough so, that it is tolerable. However, make no mistakes, this is a one time only type of show for watching. I found it very hard to give this show even a 5 rating with all the misandrist commentary in the script. The more I move through the episodes, the more irritated I become with the writing and character interactions. The shame is that had the clear agenda been left out , this could have been a great piece of content for Netflix.",5
"Ok, but nothing more. Flat.Main guy and his resemblance to Richard Madden is so obvious - and not just physical resemblance but also the role he played in Bodyguard - all is just a weak copy of the story... Only difference is the main female character - in Bodyguard she was strong and smart. This one is dull and pointless.At this point, it would be better to go through Wattpad than Netflix stories.Acting is bad, and chemistry is nonexistent.Characters are without depth and all is so predictable and expected that I had a feeling like I was rewatching and not watching for the first time.",6
"Predictable plot-twists, generic telefilm villains, patriotic fuzzy feelings, a cast of helpless and dense female characters, a cast of monolithic and generic male ones. Everything is shiny, everyone is important and the clock is ticking all the time. Some characters are egregiously bad--SyFy kinda bad--and Sarah Desjardin is perhaps the worse of them all. Action scenes, car chases and fist fights are doubtlessly the most successful moments, so this is not the worse series out there, but this is not 'good' by any standard: I watched it to the end, but I usually checked my phone at least twice per episode, which is never a good sign (I only do so when I am bored).",4
"Don't understand the great reviews, this was terribly bad, I managed to figure out who is the traitor right from the first episodes. No original story, terrible bad actions, silly dialogue that was very annoying, weak plot and way too many holes and mistakes in the story. And what's up with Rose acting so calm despite all the craziness, not to mention cracking the case in the second episodes ! Poor action and suspense, I was really bored, I barely managed to watch till episodes 3. Shocked to hear that this got renewed for a second season, while Netflix cancelling great shows like 1889 and archive 81 !! Seriously Netflix is losing their touch with great original content.",2
"I have to come out and shout against this trend of shooting in low light to make the action utterly unviewable,and to put the sound effects and music over the dialog so it is almost unintelligible. This may be the modern ""artsy"" way of producing tv but frankly I have better things to entertain me than eye and ear strain. This may be a good drama but not for me and anyone over 50 who values sound and vision. Plenty of old movies and indeed current shows hold my interest without causing this stress.Have I added enough text yet as I have surely made my point? Appeal to real people not the critics.",3
"I came here before watching and was almost put off it entirely by the bad reviews which included some of my pet peeves about a series. Anyhow, I was out of any good choices and this had moved up in the Top 10 on Netflix.I decided to give it a go, but went in with low expectations. None of the previously mentioned issues by other reviewers bothered me as the story was intriguing and fast paced. I loved shows like 24 back in the day and this had a similar feel.I guess it's not going to be everybody's cup of tea, but it's definitely worth a try if you're on the fence trying to decide. Have binged 9 of the episodes over the last day and a half. I can't remember there being a slow moment.",8
"Pros:The actors are attractive and wholesome (except for the bad guys).It's perfect if you're tired of gritty TV series.Cons:Shallow and simplistic This is 8th grade level stuff.The protagonists use profanity in, I assume, a sad attempt to seem authentic.Technology right out of the 90'sLaughable spycraftAn FBI rookie who reports directly to the President's Chief-of-Staff. Really?The show makes me think that the screenwriter(s) could not be bothered to do any actual research on how the FBI works, how presidential administrations work, how hacking in general works (let alone the mechanics of a brute-force password attack). I am baffled by the popularity of this show.",5
"With each episode, we were drawn in more and more. Our favorite genre is suspense, thriller or action and this series checked all the boxes and then some. There is unpredictable action and intrigue consistently in every episode. The cast is a perfect mix of seasoned actors, as well as a few that are brand new to us. The two main characters are our favorites and I think they work very well together. So well, that we plan to watch other shows they are in just so we can see more of them. We were so hooked that we couldn't wait to watch the next episode and ended up watching the entire season in one day. This has become the series I will be watching on a loop, until I know it by heart. ??. Can't wait for season two!",10
"This show has a solid and intriguing storyline. However, it is weighed down by acting performances by the females which would embarrass community theatre actors.A young FBI agent who is saddled with a negative family history is assigned a desk job in the White House monitoring a phone that never rings. Soon, he receives a phone call which places him in the middle of a scandal with connections to the Oval Office. He teams up with an unlikely partner, and it's unclear who they can trust, and whether they can trust each other. As the story unfolds, we discover espionage, blackmail, murder, and treason.",7
"The Night Agent"" is an incredibly engaging and thrilling TV series that will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The storyline is intricately woven and the pacing is perfectly executed, making for a truly binge-worthy experience. The show is filled with twists and turns that will leave you guessing until the very end.... Good story, engaging screen play and good action.. Very good series. Overall, ""The Night Agent"" is a must-watch for anyone who loves a good action thriller. The series is expertly crafted, with stunning visuals, a captivating storyline, and a talented cast that brings it all to life. If you haven't already seen it, I highly recommend giving it a watch!",10
"Wow, this is the new ""hit""? If so, it makes me really sad. The story is extremely dumb and implausible and makes you laugh, the dialogue is stilted and cringy, the acting is mediocre, and that is putting it charitably. The leads have no charisma to speak of, especially the man who is supposed to be an FBI agent. I am amazed that this got made at all, and I really cannot believe that people are willing to watch it, and not only that, they are apparently enjoying it. Well, to each their own, but if this is supposed to be the new standard, I am truly dismayed. We are surely capable of producing infinitely better television than this sub-par nonsense.",3
"I just finished watching the The Night Agent. And I must say I ReAlLy enjoyed watching this short series. I've been enjoying watching these short series, they don't drag out and there is usually bang bang bang action like this one. Action action action or something awesome awesome. This one is really worth watching it is full of action it really gets your emotions going on you before you know it you're shouting at the TV and you get really dry and then the acting is excellent, the actors didn't excellent job, The director did an excellent job as well as well as the production team. I was very impressed with how much went into this short series. And I would recommend watching this short series. Now if this is written right this could easily be made into a new series/movies that could become the new James Bond, Night Agent.",8
I recently watched this series and can't get my head around how incredibly predictable the whole thing was.That being said I was able to watch the whole thing which makes it better than a lot of things I've tried to watch recently.It could of easily been a couple of hours shorter and still made the same impact.The acting was rather hit and miss. Or maybe I just didn't understand why everyone was always super serious. Yes I understand the tone of the series was a serious one but hardly anyone ever smiled. It had subplots that weren't fully explained and characters making decisions or choices that had no logic. Conversations seem to have been inserted to up the running time.I should add this isn't the usual sort of thing I watch so maybe other people will enjoy it more than me.,4
"It had the same writing and acting style of a Power Rangers movie, it actually reminded me of that series when watching it. It was so ridiculous I can't believe it has good reviews. The bar has been raised with TV this century, some amazingly well written shows. I can't understand how this wasn't laughed at.I could go on and say the acting was shocking ( it was) but it wouldn't do justice for the writing . This makes Homeland look like Citizen Kane, yes even the last few series when it had almost become unwatchable.Netflix do some amazing documentaries but seem to cut corners with tv shows. I understand a second series has been commissioned, that'll be a mistake. Forget this and just watch Succession and if you've already seen that then watch it again. This will be a waste of your time unless you enjoyed Power Rangers, if you liked that you'll like this.",3
"I can say that I generally liked the series. It was a quality action-police series and the acting was quite successful. However, the fact that it resembled the Jack Ryan series in some parts led me to some criticism.The plot had a structure that was difficult to understand at the beginning. Some knots should have been untangled beforehand to make it more fluent. The series did not have a good start, but the fluency began in the middle scenes and was particularly good in terms of unpredictability in the last episodes.I liked that the cybersecurity scenes maintained their consistency within their own structure, rather than having Hollywood fakeness. However, I cannot say the same about color dynamics. Dark scenes were not easily understood and this detracted from the series.In my opinion, the fluency of the action scenes could be increased a bit more. I noticed some careless scenes, which also bothered me.In conclusion, the series was successful for me, but it could have been better in some points. Congratulations to everyone who contributed.",8
"Unlike many movies and shows I've watched recently, Night Agent was able to capture my attention and draw me in. I wouldn't blame everything I've been watching, it's more that I've been getting tired of over the top cliché and predictability.Does this show have that? Yes but in low doses more towards the middle/backend after you've been sucked in, The beginning episodes are fantastic, very well written 10/10.The middle and backend episodes are decent, definitely a drop in quality but they can keep you invested in the story - think subverted expectations but in a good way while eating a double cheeseburger with 6 extra slices of cheese.Final episode was definitely a step back towards amazing and is enough to have me invested in season 2.If you are unsure about watching this show just watch the first couple of episodes.",8
"I am not a big fan of action shows - the fighting and stunts wear me out - but The Night Agent is a big exception. I love this show. The plot is easy to follow, not convoluted like many in the genre, yet suspenseful and in the end very satisfying. It has that rare feel-good quality, as you root for and are fully invested in the good guys - who are all, by the way, three dimensional. And the ensemble acting is flat-out terrific. My favorite performance is Luciane Buchanan's nuanced and down-to-earth characterization of Rose, and my God is she pleasing to look at! I eagerly await more seasons of The Night Agent. Netflix hits it out of the park with this one!",10
"Aside from gabriel basso it's really bad acting especially luciana buchanan she's just terrible and while there is action but it's so predictible that it's boring, and the story itself we have to wait end ep 2 to have new info from what we knew beginning ep1 so not exactly fast paced show imo.There are also flashbacks if that's your thing ok, but every beginning of episode is a bit much
Could have been a great concept but it feels like they wanted it to cost so little that you can see and feel the cheap in every aspect of it whether it's the intrigue or the acting ,..., nothing feels like much thought has been put into it.",1
"This series might be worth watching if nobody else has a TV series or film about a threat to the US President. Unfortunately, there is some superb entertainment in this genre and by comparison this fares poorly. The main characters (Peter and Rose) are played by likeable actors, as is the Vice President but the rest of the characters seem two dimensional, especially the White House Chief of Staff and the two main assassins. This is no ""Designated Survivor"" or ""House of Cards"".We did stick it out to see if it improved but ultimately felt that we had wasted our time and cannot recommend it. A pity as it has clearly been made with a high budget and attracted a top spot on Netflix.",3
"Started watching this because Shawn Ryan has been involved with some of my favourite shows, and kept watching it in the hope that it would get better... but it got worse and I ended up watching it to the end just to see how bad it could possibly get.The first couple of episodes are disappointingly generic but you can kid yourself they're just laying down the basics so they can be twisted or subverted later. That Vice President who seems so devious and fascistic, obviously he's going to turn out to be a good guy... Nope. Those quirky assassins are going to turn out to be more than just cartoonish psychopaths with bad wigs... Nope. The good cop who shows a photo of his kid isn't going to get killed soon after... Nope. Every cliche is methodically checked off, every bit of sub-24 technobabble about comms and servers brought up, every firearm dependable and infinitely loaded until a fistfight would look better...The only cliche that didn't appear was the one where a bomb is defused with one second left on the timer. Every bomb that was set went off. So there was that.There were more holes in the plot than plot. Like how a convenient floor level hole that the VP's daughter kicked in the fake wall in the shipping container revealed a four character code that identified where she was. Surely it would be too dark to see even if the container was helpfully labelled on the inside six inches from the ground...And yet I watched the whole dumb thing. Why?",2
"I had lots of hopes for this series. The first two episodes were very good. But, as with almost all American made spy series, it went to mush. I really think American writers/producers have no clue to what reality is. The acting is okay. Cinamatography is very good. But the script is horrible. After the first episode, it went down hill. As you watch, you litterally can see the flaws in that it would never happen in real life.Why is every kid in American cinima pissed off, self-centered, selfish, etc. Are there any good kids out there? Rose starts out good, but after the first episode, she's a btch, stupid, no common sense. After the second episode, she's an expert in the field. And Peter just gets dummer and dummer. And if that lady was so stinkin good at throwing a knife, why'd she miss?I'll finish it, but not worth it if you haven't started it. Just poor writing. If you like this kind of show, watch something from England, Sweden, S. Korea. America just puts in to much junk and stupidity.Thank you for your time.",5
"This show has everything-it's the whole package! It kept me guessing and on my toes the whole time. When I thought I knew what was happening a twist would come and i was the definition of the Leo pointing at the tv meme. I just hate that I have to wait a while for season 2! I haven't been this entertained or Into a show in a while. I felt like it was well written with great characters. It didn't feel contrite or like It was trying too hard. It was a wild ride and I'm here for it! If you want something exciting with intrigue and not overkill on the gore and Sex, this is the show for you. Just be prepared for a lot of random f bombs!",10
"Not every TV series has to be deep and/or re-invent the action/thriller genre. This is neither of those things, but the episodes fly by in a heartbeat with non-stop entertainment. The plot is one of those ""Some high-powered Americans in charge are up to no good and will do anything to do what they want and keep it all secret"" shows. It requires -- and has -- a person or in this case a pair who stumbles across a conspiracy. At the highest level. Who's involved? Who's not? It keeps you guessing while our intrepid duo earnestly figures it out. Along the way, we're introduced to a number of interesting characters, most any of whom could be up to no good.Kudos to the writers for creating a number of strong women who aren't stereotypes of anything really, but just people, some in positions of power, some not so much, who happen to be women. The exception to that is one main character who's pretty-much the stereotype of a deranged female assassin. But no writing's perfect.So put away your logic and disbelief and just enjoy this! It's a good one.",9
"Very cheesy, lots doesn't make sense but it was somewhat entertaining! Not much more to watch I guess! Beats watching paint dry! Also they could have made an effort and hide the BC Lions logo in episode 7! Was not too hard to guess who the bad guys (or woman) are! Acting was ok, some lacked direction and over played it! I ended up watching it to see how it ends! But I still don't think it deserves a 1 on 10! I have to admit that the dangerous killers are a bit laughable but still was ok! Could have been 4 episodes with a better script or screenplay writer! Someone called it the American bodyguard... that is a bit far fetched! The bodyguard was way better!",6
"There is almost nothing believable about this story. The notion that a White House Chief of Staff would be involved at all in an FBI operation started the downhill slide into what becomes a total farce. Nothing about the actions of the elected and appointed officials makes sense at all. And the civilians? Well, they should have stayed at home.In addition, there are countless subplots that further strain a viewer's willingness to continue watching. It's just too much for anyone to care about.Finally, the acting is for the most part an insult to the SAG. The VP role, in particular, is so badly acted that one has to wonder if anyone in the crew noticed this show was a waste of resources.Entertaining? Yes, to a degree. It's not a total waste of time but don't expect much.",2
"Domestic intrigue. Good action scenes with very likeable lead characters. Nicely convoluted plot but not overly so. Good supporting characters. Altogether a fun series. If you like edge of the seat moments that are not too silly, this series is for you. One of the best of its genre. All the actors are believable. We are looking forward to a second season. I have to write and write and write. Otherwise they won't publish this review so I'll just reiterate, but you should stop reading about halfway through. Good lord, still not enough words. Very enjoyable and exciting series. Enjoy, enjoy enjoy.",10
"As other reviewers mention, this is not a big budget production. All the lead characters are decent actors with the exception of the actress who plays Diane Farr. It's possible that Diane Farr's character was meant to be annoying ... if so, the director succeeded.The plot grabbed me right away. I wasn't sure who the good guys & bad guys were for several episodes ... and kept watching to find out. I appreciated the character development. It's important to me to be able to root for the heroes & boo the villains. I was also grateful that the shoot 'em up scenes were kept to a respectful minimum.The cinematography was good and the pace, for me, was just right. It's the perfect series to curl up on the couch with the remote during a weekend where the outside weather is dismal.",8
"This was a good show, never read the novel but I always liked spy thrillers and any good shows related to law enforcement, counterterrorism, military, etc, and this is an exciting show but it's predictable and not very memorable. I think all fans of the genre will enjoy this show but not something we'd watch through multiple times. Get me binging though! The main character being a low level FBI agent who somehow gets thrown under the bus is odd, especially when he seems to be extremely talented and overqualified for being a low level agent, kind of like a Jack Ryan style G Man thriller but the action was awesome and the acting was good I think.",8
I would like to tell anyone reading this review that this is an unexpected gem and honestly a really quick binge watch. Excellent quality of story and filmography. Solid story with a real world feel to it and unexpectedly compelling storytelling not in any way the normal streaming fare. I watched ten episodes in two days and wish for a second continuation. The two leads are unknown to me but I imagine we'll see them again. Really even then agnostics are well acted and they are many. The various depictions of the president and the vice president are well cast as well as the daughter of the vice president and various people portrayed as white house support staff. Without spoilers just go watch. Really really good stuff.,9
"This could have been so much better if the writing and the scenario were being carefully though over. The acting is also bad and the chemistry of the leading pair, not existing. The reaction of the leading girl when her aunt and uncle dies, is just stupid. She does not ask to see them or even appear remotely distressed. Or later when one of their friends die, again they seem unhappy about it but that's as far as it goes. Just rlly poor writing and dialogues. Watch the bodyguard or even the other one with the lawyer , name I can't remember, which are bot much better. Anyway, if you have nothing better to do, ok watch it. Otherwise don't bother. I'm rlly surprised by the other reviews. I mean even the motive behind all this. Ok I don't like this terrorist guy, so I'm gonna hide his murder by killing 3 blocks of innocent people. And this from the almost highest ranking in the government. Not good.",5
"We really wanted this to be a decent series since it's been pretty slim pickings for a while...but this is just meh. It actually feels like maybe the whole thing was written by AI. The plot seems to have a high school level of law enforcement understanding and the script just had no substance. People don't talk like this. They don't interact like this. And everything about the DD of the FBI was nonsensical. There's so many brilliant books out there that would make amazing series if done right, how do they come up with this flimsy cheap content that requires you to switch off your logical mind.",6
"Netflix, in its earlier days used to make good movies and drama series. House of Cards is a good example. It also licensed excellent tv series like Revenge so that we could watch them without commercials. That was the biggest value proposition for me. Now, Netflix is trying to create originals, most of them are pretty bad full of explicit sex, drugs, and f words. The Night Agent is an exception, excellent story, well produced and directed. Many of the originals have actors who do not belong in the script but are there to satisfy diversity. Korean, Northern European, some other foreign shows are an exception.",8
"The Night Agent is Superb! My husband and I watch it every chance we get! I do so want to slap some of those people into next week! That Maddie Redfield! Uugghh!The actors that play Agent Sutherland and Rose Larkin really did a great job! You could believer this is really happening to them!The killers, the chases, the teamwork; it all pulls together to create a show we just love watching!I'm really looking forward to finding out what the Enemy wants and what can be done to prevent it.I'm really glad they found the baby that had been stolen! What a blessed thing!Can't wait to see what happens next!",10
"I'll be honest and give it to you straight - whether you will find it half decent or not depends upon what exactly are you looking for to watch - something that should be enough to keep you engaged to kill your boredom, or something that needs to be very logical and up-to-the-mark so that it leaves you dazzled?As for the first option, it's a green. Watch it, you'll enjoy it. The leads did okay, the storyline is okay (it's not GREAT but it does manage to change the character you suspect quite a few times), and you'll even find the ending decent.However, if you're more on the side of the second option, I'm afraid you may find various faulty logic-induced situations that might annoy your analytical mind. Therefore, you might not enjoy it that much.Nonetheless, some episodes are better than the others, and overall, it's still quite a thrill-watch to sit back and enjoy.Happy watching! :)",7
"Your usual FBI show.Some TERRIBLE acting, laughably so... along the lines of SyFy quality of acting. There plenty of enjoyable action & quite predictable twists. This is an ideal show for some passive viewing, when you're mindlessly scrolling social media, cooking, cleaning or doing anything else. It does not require your full attention. In fact, right now I am writing this review while also ""watching episode"" :)These types of shows have their place. It will not change your life and you will not be dying for another season, but you will have a clean house, some cooked food, maybe even a sourdough loaf AND be up to date on your social media feed!",5
"This can be done right, like State of play, Bodyguard or Slow horses, but Night Agent is far far from that.The writing is cringeworthy and the acting is flat. The observant viewer will figure out who the traitor is in the first two episodes and that leaves you with 9 long episodes to suffer through. A major government conspiracy is discovered through a Google image search. That's how intricate the plot is. The two protagonists are about as interesting as a pair of cardboard cutouts whereas the main villains are oddly unhinged.The only reason I finished the show is because I was home sick and didn't have the bandwidth for something more complicated. But if you're not knocked out by the flu, don't bother with this embarrassment.",1
"Terrible language. Bad writing. But why is everyone saying it's so awesome? I must be missing something. It just seems lazy and unnecessary to have all the dialogue loaded with swearing - sometimes when it doesn't even fit.Pros: Good chemistry with leads. The lead guy is super handsome and it made me look up his profile to see what else he had been in. Decent storyline.Fast moving and a good pace with the storytelling.Good creepy vibe with the couple that is stalking the girl - they are pretty good at acting the part of bad guys.Overall good but even if I could watch on Vidangel They would have to bleep out every other word!! Look all I'm saying is if Bourne identity can pull it off, the night agent should be able to as well.",3
"I enjoyed this at first, but it couldn't sustain so many episodes. It should have been a single film or much shorter series - 5 episodes maximum. I liked the two lead actors and look forward to seeing them in better productions. Here their roles were a bit superficial. More back story and some hanky-panky would have been beneficial. The bad guys were pathetic, as was their plot. I'm still not sure what they were up to. There was not a single scene with Hang Chau that I bought into her character. Just looked like somebody that strolled onto the set wearing a weird wig. Too bad, because I like women in strong roles -such as Chief of Staff for the President. Opportunity lost.",6

"I'm not sure what everyone expected with this show, it was super enjoyable. Fleshed out villains who could blur the line, solid actors, characters you could root for.The action begins 1/4 through the first episode and doesn't conclude until 3/4 into the last episode. Once it starts going it does not let up.The series held my attention through out, and it was a fun, entertaining ride. I was surprised how much I enjoyed this series as I tend to enjoy more cerebral series'.This won't be for everyone but if you are seeking an action packed conspiracy thriller that leaves no stone unturned and thoroughly entertains, then look no further.Highly recommend!",9
"It's been a while since I've seen a show that had me watching several episodes one after the other. This is an entertaining adventure that features an FBI agent who ends up working together with someone who has been targeted by unknown bad guys. Each episode they work together to investigate the mystery surrounding the events of the first episode.It might seem like there are some coincidences or character introductions that don't have anything to do with the main plot at various parts, but it all comes together in the end. It has a diverse cast but it's not woke trash like so many of the other shows that are on Netflix. It's just entertainment without an agenda.",8
"As someone who served as an Army Officer and now works in the intelligence community, I finished the last episode, and my only thought was ""I really enjoyed that."" No, it's not the most groundbreaking political thriller, but it's complex enough to keep you guessing, the characters are engaging, the story is fast paced, and there's very little wasted time (everything has a purpose). When I had the time, I always looked forward to the next episode, and I was never disappointed.One of the subtle elements that I perhaps enjoyed the most is there's really no ""damsel in distress"". All of the characters have their own unique attributes, and all of them can pull their weight based on their specific roles. As a consequence, you get attached to all of the main characters in different ways, and it draws you in to the deeper story.",9
"FBI agent who uncovers a devious plot within the White House and has to race against time to save the world. Of course there's a girl helping him, whom he rescued from assassins. Subplots include a mystery about our hero's father, problems with the VP's daughter and some secret service agents who are on the side of right.It is all incredibly formulaic and predictable, but the script isn't too bad and there's plenty of action for those who like that. The main problem is that the lead actor, Gabriel Basso, puts in a subpar performance, quite wooden and unconvincing. Most of the rest do a serviceable job.Ultimately it's 10 episodes of reasonable entertainment which doesn't require a single morsel of cerebral effort from the viewer, and you know exactly how things will turn out. This genre has been done much better in other series, but then again also much worse. 6/10.",6
"So as the episode begins in the first 5 min you'll feel like they are trying to create a character with all the goodies I mean an agent with troublesome past but still happy which in real life is not the truth and agents mostly have a stressful life in reality. Again an agent which is still young but has kind of no weak spots, so it might seem like they are just throwing some action adventure mix story just to get it entertaining.You might want to close it eventually but if hold on to then it gets a little slow paced and at some point interesting and then you'll want to carry on. Some of the story part you'll find logical but others not.The show is not the worst but if you are hoping that it ticks all ingredients of a good NETFLIX spy story, it doesn't.Still it's good to watch if you have nothing else better than this, it won't get you bored at all.",6
"I don't know who came up with this darkness effect on movies and TV shows. But even when it's dark in the daytime, it's hard to make out what's going on sometimes and the night scenes are even worse. This is just too darn dark, dark dark. I think it distracts from the action question I don't know who you contact or complain to about this production design. I would think the actors themselves wouldn't be happy with this kind of technique. I think it takes away from their ability to do their jobs. Come to the point that if it's a new thing and it's dark in the first episode, I will not watch the rest.",6
"Ok the action is good and the script is good, it is a little stretched out 10 episodes is too much but it's watchable but..
Is that a way a lead actor is holding a gun? I mean where's the training? It's too obvious how he waves it around like what's wrong with directing these days?To the actess who plays rose, this is not acting this is pure annoyance actually, and did anyone count how many times she says ""My aunt and uncle"" ,. And what's with the serious face all 10 episodes if she didn't even cry one tear for her "" aunt and uncle""I'm worried about movies for this generation, we'll miss the great actors alot!",4
"I can't remember who in the film industry once described a successful project, small or large screen, as one that causes the viewer to care about the characters in it. Of the millions of such statements I've heard this is the one that has proved to be most, and most often, true.I realize that fact once I've finished watching something I really liked and did happen to care about the characters.The Night Agent, is one of those.The premise is an effective hook. The action is consistent and almost immediate with few slow spots. Some characters are not who they seem which makes for some healthy ambiguity that keeps you guessing.The Night Agent is for those of us who love conspiracy/action flix involving underdogs who are expected to accomplish overwhelming tasks against bigger, badder, diabolical foes.It wasn't perfect. It's the first season. It's surely gonna have another and that's a good thing. A good thing because we'll get to see the newest Night Agent come into his own. And being the insomniac that I am, I'll probably watch the next season without a break like I did the first.Look forward to season 2...",9
"So i just completed series 1 of the night agent. From the first episode i was hooked and wanted to know what happens next. Another way i measure whether i am being entertained or not is if i look at my phone when im watching something. For every episode on the night agent my phone was never taken out of my pocket.Excellent acting- excellent action!! I would not take notice of the other reviews stating about logic or real life spy stuff.. calm down mateys its fiction... Jeeeez!! Anyway as i was saying, there are likeable characters in this series (except agent arrington, she was annoying andddd everyone else played their roles to perfection.Trust me just watch it... you wont be disappointed!!",9
"The first two episodes are what really make or break a TV show. As of the first episode, I can't really say I enjoy this show at all. I mean, any sort of show that involves government espionage and double agents really seem predictable or can't be executed just right. And this is no exception. This show throws logic and character development out the window.The problem I have is that these characters don't feel all that interesting. One agent is put on night duty answering calls that rarely occur because of an incident that wasn't his fault, and he has to protect this lady who apparently knows something that would get her killed by federal agents. This doesn't make things any bit better because the main assassins are a couple, and boy are they absolutely cringy to watch sometimes. I don't give a damn about some awkward romantic evening and also being on call to some corrupt agent giving them assignments.Worst of all, the acting was above average at best. I'm not acting expert but every delivery felt kinda dry. I'm not the one to say how to portray an FBI agent any better than what the actors could do but there's certainly a ton of room for improvement to make agents not feel static like they're directly reading off a teleprompter. Again, the antagonists as well; really weirdly played out. A couple being trained assassins just doesn't fit for being a serious show.As I said before, this felt predictable. It's like I've heard of this espionage plot before. Because of this, it just made this show meh. Good disposable entertainment from your dear friend, Netflix. Watch if you want but don't think that this is a ""must watch"" show anytime soon.",3
"Yeah, I did want to like it... And I actually did, for an episode or so.The storyline isn't totally unique, but its fresh enough, and there's a slight new angle. The sets are great, the location shots are cool... The action - yeah!It's the acting, and the writing, and the bad acting trying to deliver the bad writing while trying hard not to fall into a plot hole... (hah! I couldn't resist)I think it's easy to get wrapped up in the action, Its good, and there's a good amount of it. But, when you're wondering about the bad guys smoking out the cabin, you don't realize how totally nuts it is to have the good guys 30' down the road when the bad guys exit.The show tries to leave you in that state of ""well, maybe the postman did it with the fire ax!"" but you instead realize that you're supposed to be feeling that way, than actually feeling that way.Casting... Yeah, nah. I think a bad cast has a chance with a good script, but a bad script just keeps a bad cast in 4-point movies.",4
"It's incredible how many 10 reviews are here.After watching I'm wondering if they are actual reviewers (if they are the future is dark).There's absolutely no logic, you can find very big mistakes every few minutes in every episode.The mistakes are not only on logic and continuity but also makes no sense in comparison with real life situations, protocols and decisions (that even the dumbest person would take).I've read other reviews like the one you are reading now, and thought it can't be that bad, well it is that bad.Oh. I almost forgot acting is quite bad also, not credible but that is not the worst. The worst is the bad script, the lack of sense of the plot and the incredible numbers of unreal situations.You can ve doing something better than this show for sure.",1
"This show manages to be really entertaining well having a jumbled mess of a plot. I really like the concept, but the execution is crummy. The worst part of the show though is just how predictable it is. Everytime a new character was introduced you could just immediately tell if they were good or not. I'm not even joking everything feels as predictable as a children's book. The show goes back and forth between deciding the real reason they would be gong after her along with a bunch of other things. Also this is a pretty minor detail, but you're telling me these people are highly trained, but the fight like if you grabbed a crowd of people out of a coffee shop.",5
"Young FBI Agent Peter Sutherland was the right man in the wrong place when he managed to prevent a terrorist atrocity on the Washington DC Metro. A year later he is approached about a new position; he is to sit in a room in the White House monitoring a phone that 'never rings'. Rose Larkin is a young cybersecurity entrepreneur who is staying with her aunt and uncle. She hears them talking about somebody who can't be trusted in the White House. Shortly afterwards two assassins attack the house; Rose's aunt and uncle instruct her to flee to the neighbours and call a phone number. She does; it is Peter's phone. The two of them are about to be catapulted a deadly conspiracy that will see them forced to go on the run as it becomes clear that there are few people they can trust. Elsewhere somebody appears to be plotting something involving the Vice President's daughter.I thought this was a solid thriller with a good premise. The opening scenes are explosively exciting and the action rarely lets up for the rest of the series. Peter and Rose are fine protagonists and the supporting characters are good too; notable amongst these are the two assassins who are after them, the VP's daughter and the two Secret Service Agents protecting her and the White House chief of staff who is the only person in authority Peter trusts. There are plenty of twists and turns throughout the series keeping us wondering just who can be trusted. It does require some suspension of disbelief, as do most series in this genre. The cast does a good job. Too many series leave without wrapping up enough plot lines in the hope of getting a second season; thankfully this nicely resolves all the key issues but still manages to end in a way that leaves the possibility open for more. Overall I'd recommend this to fans of the genre.",8
"The trailer let me know that this wasn't going to be up to standard but I gave it two episodes only because I saw Adam Arkin's name on list of directors. He doesn't choose projects lightly. The pilot showed some promise but in the end it's a weak, American TV script. Just not up to snuff for prestige streaming TV, in my opinion. And I know this dude can write from The Shield which, in it's prime, was excellent. Although come to think of it, that story became more and more ridiculous as time went on. This is over-the-top implausible the way ""24"" was. If I can't suspend disbelief why am I watching?! Yes, espionage thrillers are very difficult to pull off but streaming services, in general, get the very best from around the globe. Fauda, Kleo, Bodyguard...it's in the writing! This was phoned in and looks like it was put together during the pandemic with no money. I bailed after the 2nd ep. I couldn't even wait around to see if Adam A could turn out a decent episode.",4
I managed to only sit through the first thirty minutes as the script was so bad and the actors didn't really get a chance to grab my attention.The typical American drama/spy series with all the 'pretty people' also makes truly unbelievable.Was really looking forward to a good new series to watch and was totally disappointed.This story seems to get re-made every couple of years.Would be good if they could come up with something new or original for a change.I've been watching so many great British Television shows recently that any of the American ones just don't seem to be able to come up to the same standards.,2
"Excuse the non English speaker...
I never wrote a review before, but this show puzzled me enough to share my opinion about it.The story itself seems very interesting and captivating , but the execution is really bad. There are gaps in writing, there are completely illogical situations, the conversation is cliché on cliché, the music is...B production material... the acting... oh my. There are some decent performances (the villains mostly), but the main characters, especially the computer programmer Rose is to be laughed at sometimes.Despite all the above, to my own surprise, I binged it. The main character Peter Sutherland was mostly convincing, the two mercenaries had interesting personal story going on, and there were few other entertaining moments that kept me wanting more. I read that second season is planned... hopefully with budget better used and more convincing acting.",6
"Like some other people it seems I also watched this show on a whim, knowing nothing about it and expecting a fairly standard political thriller.Well it was standard in some ways, but it had a fresh and unique style I thought, very gritty and convincing fights and a great chemistry in the duo of the main characters who both showed a lot of energy. I liked the quirky oddball assassins too.I noted that Luciane's plucky female lead ""Rose"" adjusted rather too easily to the dilemma she was thrown into, but I found myself hugely entertained by the gutsy way she was always jumping right in to help in the fights. Gabriel Basso was wholly likeable and despite the occasional inconsistency in the cast there were moments of truly skilful acting all around, and snappy dialogue.Again, there was something about this show that was really easy to enjoy - I suppose it's not great art but it sure was a fun watch, and I'm already looking forward to season two.",9
"I didn't have high expectations, and that helped me enjoy this easily watchable series. From my point of view, it's a well executed action/thriller series, with nostalgic characteristics.With a few exceptions, there is a lot of decent acting and fairly executed scenes. It managed to keep me interested, even though there were some predictable parts of the storyline. That's totally ok, as long as the writers are not pretending otherwise.I'm happy that Netflix has finally put out something that is simple, yet enjoyable. Would willingly watch another season, and hopefully the style and identity of the series remains the same.",7
Peter Sutherland..first thing that comes to mind is 24 Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland). Love watching spy and espionage type shows this one is for you. I was hoping it would be similar to 24 with more seasons and episodes we'll see if that happens as I am finishing up episode 10. Peter and Rose played there roles well. Show has a lot of action and and a solid story line. Excited to see what's to come and hope it gets renewed for season 2. I haven't checked yet.Everyone have a nice day and be kind to one another. Thanks for reading my review! God Bless America! We are all one human race love you all.,10
"This is a really good show. The acting is great and the storyline is superb. The characters in this show are multi faceted, even the supporting actors that play the assassins - I really felt for them when watching the parts that the woman assassin wanted to get away from her job and have a family like other normal. I'm really pleasantly surprised to see that aspect of the show, because usually the bad characters are just one dimensional. The relationship between the two leads is really natural too, nothing feels forced. Love the portrayal of Diane Farr the chief of staff character. She's also pretty impressive. All in all a really great show. Super excited for season 2!!",10
"This will be very straight to the point. The lead female protagonist is played by a very wooden actress. The lead male protagonist isn't exactly the most exciting actor either but he shines by comparison.Robert Patrick and Hong Chau give weight to an otherwise unsteady cast.Each episode's screenplay, such as they are, aren't probably treated by the director to make the dialogue at least try to work in a number of moments. Nonetheless these are issues that could also have been fixed in the editing room. The mistakes are as baffling as scenes where the dialogue is clearly written for the action to be fast, but what transpires on screen before us is mind numbingly slow - or vice versa.So to are there a lot of odd jumps that are either shoddy writing, shoddy editing, or shoddy direction.Is this show watchable? Sure. But only an idiot doesn't know what happens next.",4
"Honestly at first I wasn't expecting anything, but surprisingly this series blows my mind. Strong element of this series is the Plot... so good...!!I even has to stopped for a while to catch my breath overwhelmed by how this series present the surprises.Although the casts play the role felt a bit flat but I like the interactions between Ellen and Dale, the dialogue, the depth and how Phoenix Raei plays Dale, nice...!!Nothing much about the details of technical aspects, but again I have to say that the story is so good..!!Can't wait for season 2. Hopefully the writers could keep up the good work.",8
"A well written spy thriller that is fast yet even-paced all the way through. There were no 'off' episodes, there wasn't anything TOO unrealistic or hokey about it, no ""that doesn't make any sense"" or ""nobody would ever do that in real life"" moments, which is seemingly very tough to do these days since nearly every show has several of them.It's not Oscar-worthy or anything that's going to be talked about a lot years from now, but this is just an an all-around solid watch that is very fun and binge-able. Settle in over the weekend and have a good time with The Night Agent and I'll look forward to season 2.",8
"This is a bad knock off of a stupid show, The Bodyguard. It is entirely stupid on it's own, but looking at it as a knock off of an entirely stupid show, it's on a whole level of new stupid. At no point does the plot work, it makes no attempt at logic, and the characters have no depth. Objectively and subjectively this is bad.Their concept of how the branches of government work, or even vague ideas of feasible conspiracy theories are pathetic.All that being said, weed is mostly legal now, and you might as well use that, and go for a binge on this show. It's still lots of ""stuff"" going on ????? with attractive people ??",5
"I had feared that this series would not be much good, and so I was confirmed. The story is a rehash of parts that have been seen many times, nothing is surprising, there are no twists, there are no credible characters or plot elements, everything is in the realm of hysterical conspiracy theories that are not fundamentally revealed. The viewer is not left in the dark about the characters themselves, but rather about their motives. But that doesn't matter in the end, as one is more concerned with the acting inadequacies of Gabriel Basso as agent Peter Sutherland or the atrocious Hong Chau as the shady Diane Farr. Fola Evans-Akingbola fits seamlessly into these poor performances. It is to be feared that there will be a 2nd season, which I will definitely not watch, because it can only get worse.",4
"You know just a reminder that this is a Netflix show and lately (most of) their shows suck and since Designated Survivor season 1 and Black List (was it Netflix from the start though?) there hasn't been a action thriller released that met this standard for me.Now the thing is wether or not they'll continue the plot with the current characters (who I really enjoyed, really loved the leads) or do a new story line with a new night agent (which could be promising if the writing isn't lazy or repetitive - it could turn itself into the blacklist franchise)However I really hope they don't go around the mess up the second season by not being creative enough.",9
"I was hooked early in the first episode, and had to binge it because I couldn't wait to get to the next episode. Gabriel Basso and Luciane Buchanan were exceptional in the lead roles, and the chemistry that they came to have during an almost impossible situation just made everything so real and believable. The supporting cast was pretty amazing too. Whoever did the casting here, really nailed it. Nice job! Sometimes I start to wonder when watching a movie or series, 'Do I really care what happens to these people?' Here, the answer is a definite 'Yes!'. I must say, this is one of the best series I have seen in a long while!",10
"I'm a huge fan of political thrillers like this, that remind me of the Jason Bourne series and Bodyguard starring Richard Madden, so when I saw the preview for this a few months ago I was excited to see it! At the same time, I knew it was going to be a Netflix show (which many times can be a hit or miss) so I wasn't expecting a perfect show.When I started the show less than a week ago, I admit that the first episode didn't quite impress me (the actress who played Rose was a little flat in her acting during the inciting incidents-she did get much better throughout though!) but as each episode progressed, things got a lot more captivating, interesting, mind-blowing, and entertaining!I won't give anything away, but the strength of this show is the plot! Talk about plenty of plot twists and political intrigue! The actors were all pretty good, and as others have said, the story just makes sense. Nothing too far-fetched or unbelievable. The only reason I give this 1 less star than perfect is because of the weaker start, but it certainly redeems itself very quickly. Don't write off the show based in the 1st couple of episodes. Stick it out, and I promise you, you will enjoy it. The actress that portrayed Diane Farr was my absolute favorite, and the writers just did an overall good job of giving all the major characters back stories and dimension without making it lengthy.Everything is also pretty simple to follow along with even if you're not familiar with this genre of film or American politics. Watched 2 episodes a night and finished in less than a weeks. This truly is a must watch this spring. Give it a chance.",9
"As per the the title.I'm not sure if she's supposed to be a complete moron or mentally handicapped, but if so, than she is absolutely nailing it without question.If on the other hand, she is supposed to be a fully functioning adult who's living in a facsimile of the real world, she is failing in every possible way.Psycho killers chasing her, she's worried about jumping down from a height of maybe 8 to 10 feet. Delays doing so by asking relevant but not truly necessary questions (in the sense that she doesn't have time to question things).There are a dozen instances where she just asks the most vapid questions imaginable, as if she's never once in her life seen a single spy movie or anything dealing with covert government ops.It's true that when you work for such an organization, doing shady things, you would or should naturally be suspicious of anybody and everybody, but she flip flops between being super suspicious, to not, and at the same time making the guy question his superiors motives.The psycho killer female is also a moron, she seems to want to set down roots and play house with her killing partner who may or may not have a functioning penis. Unless they are actually living in the area and renting, I see no rationale where this makes sense. I got the impression that they were mobile assassins, and would relocate as per each contract requires.Alternatively maybe she's wanting them both to settle down and slow down on their killings and live a more sedentary lifestyle???This is a review of only the first 3 or 4 episodes, will update after I watch more.",3
"This one fits in nicely with 90% of TV drama. It fills in the gaps between the occasional good stuff and serves as padding for Netflix.That is it's purpose and as such, is banged out factory-like along with dozens of others low brow shows. There's very little money thrown at it. Mostly 2D characters forcing along the disjointed plot, acting by numbers and jobbing actors who don't really care what they're told to say. Ok for some background noise while you're doing something more interesting. There's really not much more today other than I have another forty characters to finish this revie...",5
"I know the show is fantasy as is all TV so I try not to be too hard and expecting realism, but this show is just too ridiculous with various plot holes.The ability of high-level government officials to meet clandestinely, absolutely ridiculous. I forget what episode but multiple shots fired at a hotel and no police on scene. Absolutely ridiculous. The multiple times when experienced law-enforcement personnel didn't immediately call for back up, absolutely ridiculous.And experience law enforcement officer, taking direction from a civilian and a civilian knowing better than the law enforcement officer completely ridiculous.Why the heck they didn't get online and get the story out to everyone they could once they realized the Chief of Staff was in on it defies all logic. Get the heat on them, get the story out.The way the VP talks to the chief of staff about his next move when his daughter is kidnapped and he suspects she is involved, colossally ridiculous. They threaten him and he does nothing? I could go on and on about this stupid show.If you want, mindless, fantasy and adventure, go ahead enjoy. You've got to be able to really put your brain on hold though. It might be easier to do that if the show came across as more of a comedy rather than a serious drama. Very soap opera-ish even at times.",2
"You got all these self proclaimed ""thinkers"" assuming that others don't recognize or acknowledge inconsistencies in shows when in reality they aren't letting it warp their whole view of what is a more than decent plot. If you aren't the annoying kind, you'll probably really enjoy this show and finish it quickly. It has nice suspense. I think the initial action kick off seemed out of nowhere and even after it had been going on for 5 minutes I still wasn't really feeling anything, but the explanations and the progression that follows makes up for it. The characters aren't super well developed but for this kind of show, we really don't need a lot of back story, if anything when they delve into the past it's when I get kind of bored. Just be wary they drag their feet a little coming to the conclusions and the amount of side quests they experience will also get old when you're anxious for the unveiling..",7
"This show is an example of good story telling, to some extend it takes too much time on unnecessary details. But it tries to develop characters and provide some background motivation for their actions. Overall, for there are too many fillers that stretch the story a little too much. Also, there are too many unbelievable moments in there. It is just entertainment, but the only believable part in there is, that part of the US goverment would be willing to accept severe collateral damage among their own citizen to protect their own interests and stay in power. That's some truth in there. Besides that, there are far too many moments that leaves you dumbfolded. Nevertheless, the story unfolding is capturing, even though to some point you just want to see if you predicted it right.",6
"...and padded with too many dull and basically meaningless scenes. The plot is quite a bit past believable and wildly over complicated. The cast in so-so, no standout actors. Like so many Netflix series it is at least three episodes longer than it needed to be. I'm a bit surprised to see the high ratings. It's just not that good That's all
I really have to say but IMDB-like Netflix-requires that reviews be longer than they need to be so I've got to pad it with stuff like this. The bottom line is that this is a decent series if you have a lot of extra time on your hands but there are many more worthwhile shows.",4
"I just finished season 1 of The Night Shift and while I enjoyed the majority of the series, it does have some issues that don't seem likely to change. Let's start with the good: Great action, intriguing storyline and great acting by the lead role, someone I've never seen before and expect to see more of. It's a pretty dark show, there are some gruesome deaths that are both shocking and entertaining for the premise of the show. The bad: some dialogue is laughably horrible, the mistakes are repetitive and the bad guys are obvious. I knew who was behind everything halfway thru episode 2. If you can suspend your logic, you might enjoy it.",7
"There's no way a human could have written this stiff, awkward dialog that sounds as though it was either translated from a foreign language into English or simply put through an AI program. Human people (as distinguished from AI people) simply don't talk the way these poor actors are forced to talk -- in simple sentences that betray almost no real emotion, sentences that sound like a computer's idea of how humans might talk: ""We must go now because there is danger ahead."" ""You had better watch out now please."" ""Be careful as someone might be about to kill you."" (Not actual sentences from the show; these are much more human-sounding.)The shame here is that clearly everyone is trying hard. And the plot is no better nor worse than other successful shows. But the dialog is so laughably bad that even the AI program that created this is probably too embarrassed to take credit for it.",2
"Netflix again throws at us some sub rate rubbish serie.It took us 20 minutes of the first episode to turn it off and remove from the watch list.During those 20 minutes we burst few times laughing, mind this is not a comedy, so this tells.After the main female character reaction to the news about the death of her aunt and uncle ""but people loved them so much"" (argh!!!!!! Who wrote this idiotic line????) we had it.I wish Netflix stopped wasting monies on producing such rubbish - if they keep offering telenovela level junk, maybe they should also think about cutting their prices because bumping into such series makes me willing to rethink the rationale behind paying the premium subscription rate.Of course there is still plenty to watch, but I can't believe the audience of Netflix has such poor taste or is so little demanding that this production pops as the top 10.It becomes also tiring to spend time looking for something decent to watch, just because the ratio of poor production keep increasing by Netflix.It comes to that I am specifically while browsing looking for movies/series without the Netflix logo.It is kinda sad, there was time when I would not pay attention to that.Life is too short, don't waste your time on that one.",2
Have you watched Batman v. Superman.Well it sucked cause the story was there and it wasn't told and this has some good action but the story telling tracks about as good as my 9 year old nephew telling me a story.This is a cute show but that's about it. I now understand why there are so many in the way people. How tf is this a 7.4. Get lost.I have to continue this review cause it's too short. So let's speak as if we are writers of said show. Guy on bus boom. Cute omg nice guy what. Action. Get chased. Love interest. More booms. Someone isn't trusted. Oops bad acting. Talk about secrets cause that's cool. Sass from the villains. More bad acting. Don't keep a story line. Have more sass. Sell to stupid people on Netflix. $$$,3
"This is one of the worst written shows I've seen. It starts well but just gets worse with every episode. Do NOT get invested in this by starting a single episode.The plot holes are so obvious and so many. It's nonsensical. It seems as if the writers/producers knew how bad the writing and plot were but just didn't care. Why does an FBI agent need the help of a journalist to analyse the value of evidence? Why can't a ""former navy SEAL"" swim a single decent lap? How do the VP and Chief of staff with the highest security clearance not have a secret service detail at all times?The lead duo are horrible actors with no chemistry whatsoever. The two assassins were better actors, with a better storyline and more chemistry than the leads.How does Netflix produce this garbage!",3
"The mystery, character interactions, fast-paced sequences and on-the-spot conclusions drawn by our heroes are all excellent. Pursuers, menacing and dangerous. Relationship between the two leads are enjoyable and feels organic. Character backgrounds quickly established but not left wanting. You know exactly who these people are and everything they do lines up with what is told. All-in-all very well done.However, critical parts of it are completely unrealistic. Setting aside how top-level govt access works for which knowledge I have none, obvious common sense occurrences are absolutely ridiculous. There'll be covert planning done within clear earshot of someone that my be compromised sitting less than five feet away. You don't need experience with agency procedure to see how nonsensical this is. How can anyone continue to believe the plot with such an egregious oversight? It outright removes any danger or tension felt since this takes you out of it entirely. Also, other common sense things like needing to provide personal information for access to public records is just not even thought of by someone who is supposed to be brilliant at most everything else up to this point. Anyone and their mother would consider this before walking into the building, especially with a fugitive status. It's like they created this situation just to show how smart this character is by them improvising a solution, but they're not smart enough to have realized the obstacle in the first place? Things like this happen throughout the season with varying degree, but now and then you'll come across something that is so in your face it feels lazy, and completely undermines the high points this show has to offer. That's a shame, since there's a lot going for it.I gave it a seven because it's still fun to watch. Despite the above and some awkward over-acting by some of the cast it held my attention and made me want to see what happens next. Right on the edge of being a fantastic show but ends up just shy of that.Entertaining, long as you don't think too hard about it.",7
"You start with a premise that is entirely unbelievable... a young woman awakens in the night to be told she needs to escape and contact the FBI (why can't they all escape?). She's told nothing of importance and given nothing of significance... and yet the bad guys pursue her like she's holding the holy grail. And the FBI will spare nothing to protect her... or kill her. Literally nothing about this makes sense.And then the female lead becomes the most annoying and snarky character in the show... literally never sheds a single tear after the only family she has left is murdered... And the male lead seems entirely incompetent and overly emotional in a way that makes it difficult to root for him. The entire plot is wrapped in in such a duplicitous, cockamamie, twisty turny shifting plot that eventually you don't really care who the bad guy is anymore and what they want... bc none of it makes sense. Literally not a single character in this show makes a move that makes any sense. They make moves that only serve to further the plot, logic be damned. The best thing I can say about this show is that I made it 7 episodes, so it's tolerable for a while...The writing: awful 4/10
The acting: wooden 6/10
The characters: hateable 4/10
The direction: boring 5/10
The story: generic 5/10
The action: incredibly poorly choreographed 5/10
The romance: forced 0/10I gave this 5/10 OVR bc if you can convince yourself to watch this show, it's probably bingeable, however at best you'll forget about this show as soon as you finish watching it. At worst you'll question every decision that led you into wasting the time it took to finish the entire season. I hope this doesn't get picked up for another season.",5
"I'm not sure why there are so many bad reviews, but I loved this series and I hope that there is a season two. After having watched the series I decided to go back and read the book on which it was based. Very loosely based I might add. Now after finishing the book I can honestly say (in my opinion) that this is one instance where the tv adaptation was better than the book. The initial book storyline was there (involving the ubiquitous Russians), but the series' storyline was fleshed out quite a bit more and had a dual storyline involving the vice president's daughter. I must say that having watched the series first I did picture Gabriel Basso in my mind as I was reading, even though he is 6"" shorter than book Peter.",9
"I had never heard of this show; I watched it after I saw it was a new show trending on Netflix, so I decided to give it a go, and I'm glad I did.The Night Agent is a fast-paced thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat; it didn't take me long to get hooked.A good thriller needs a good cast and a decent script with twists and plenty of action; The Night Agent doesn't disappoint. I ended up binge-watching the series.There is plenty of action, but thankfully this show doesn't rely solely on gunshots, fight scenes and big explosions. The plot kept me guessing, yet it was not a ridiculous storyline and was very well written.It's one of the best shows released by Netflix in a while; there wasn't an episode I did not enjoy, and I'm delighted to learn there will be a second season.",10
"I started watching episode 1 which throws you straight into the action and then just doesn't stop. I was hooked and watched the first six episodes back to back.The next day I watched the final four episodes to its satisfying conclusion. This is the best action series I've seen since 24 hours. There are many twists and turns in the plot keeping you guessing who is to be trusted throughout.The actors mostly unknown faces previously are all convincing, the script and direction is excellent and it looks to be an expensive production unlike many other cheap budget action films I've suffered recently. I only hope there is a follow up series as good as season 1!",9
"Good premise, bad writing and development. Who in this world would believe that a high rank officer of the White House will allow a low level ""treason"" suspect and an outsider, to conduct an extraoficial investigation that involves a possible terrorist attack.On the other hand, lately there is a misconception that a strong woman needs to be rude and arrogant, that has to be always right and no one should question her decisions, even if they are stupid, but she can questions everyone else's. This line of character writing has no sense at all.The story base was very good, loved the first episode, stopped watching in the middle of the 3; continued few weeks after just because was lazy and didn't want to spend 1 hour something to watch, and after 2 more episodes, decided to end the season because it's Holy Friday and I just want to rest. Good series for a nothing to do I'm lazy day, otherwise is a waste of time.",5
Story line is a good one ....but the horrible acting made it almost unbearable to watch...luckily only 10 eposides so just dragged it out. Story had so much potential and the twists were interesting and not so cliché but the acting my God. Seemed like I'm watching some kind of acting class ....very amature acting. Hopefully replaced cast if by any chance it gets renewed for another season. All in all not so bad worth a watch just not edge of seat binge worthy. Caught me checking how much time left on each eposide far too many times. Potential for another season for sure let's see if they can dish out something better then this below average show.,6
"I'm three episodes in, and I can already tell this thing is at least four episodes too long. Maybe six. I may have to skip ahead to episode 10 just to see how it all works out.If this thing was all plot and no characters it might be tolerable. There's a scene where the characters return to the Scene of the Crime and one reminisces about how she used to play hide and seek in that room. NOTHING about that scene rings true. There's a subplot about the (inept) killers and how one of them wishes for a normal life, and I swear, if one of them doesn't kill the other before the show is over, I will be sorely disappointed.The screenwriter is using the Big Book of Clichés, and not even a recent volume. It's awash in a sea of tropes. The main character joined the FBI because/in sprite of his father being a suspected traitor who ""died in a car accident"" before he could clear his name. I HOPE we find out his father was murdered, or this is a massive red herring. (Note: The whole things tastes of herring.) The hero himself is suspected of planning a transit explosion because why? TMZ said so. There's not a scene that isn't predictable, or is believable.The book that this series is based on is 432 pages long. The series is 10 hours long. You could probably get through the book in half that time.",6
"Watching a clueless bumpkin pretending to be an agent, ex special ops, a cop or soldier will cause you to disenfranchise your audience who are not similarly clueless bumpkins.Get firearms training if you're going to play a role that involves firearms.You cannot realize how painful it is to watch someone with zero training or skills pretend to be something they're clearly not.As we've seen with petulant man child Alec Baldwin, a lack of firearms training can also be deadly.If you're going to include firearms in your script, make sure they behave realistically and the operator can effectively manipulate them.It is literally like watching a chimpanzee saw a steering wheel side to side pretending to drive.",1
Netflix had been bringing out bummers all of last year and with Night Agent they seem to have come out of that rut. There is some fine action and a whole lot of decent story telling on the way. Netflix also tries to keep it simple with a lot of simple cliches peppered here and there.Even though some of the twists are so cliched the obvious ones. Don't leave you disappointed because of the way in which the story is told. On the whole it's a decent watch and the way it ended Netflix definitely thought it would make the cut as a season 2 is probably on the cards. I would recommend this for fans of action and suspense. A good one time watch.,8
"DIane Farr and the VP are in on the conspiracy and it is easy guessed in ep1 and revealed in ep6. However,r eps 7-10 which I have not watched seem to play out with a story within a story. The 1st 5 mins of ep1 is great and then total crash a burn.You want the two assassins to win and kill everyone so this would just end. The search for proof is something out of. It is reminds me of The Da Vinci Code movie but less interesting. Many back stories on each eps does give you a bit of information on each character but nothing that makes you care. The quest remains in ep7-10 if the president was involved so I continue to watch and determine if S2 is worth exploring if they have it.",4
"I really tried to like this show. That's not to say it wasn't entertaining, but it just didn't do it for me. So many things to say but it all boils down to a very bad story line, which caused bad acting (especially the Diane Farr actor).I try not to be an accuracy snob but the entire story hedging on a top secret classic rotary phone with no buttons is ridiculous. Also, the White House Chief of staff having her own little lapdog FBI agent? Come on.It's not all bad though. There's good action, good thrill throughout which kept me coming back to finish the season. Good pace as well. I'm not sold on a season two.",4
"The Night Agent is an unrealistic and knowledge-bereft, flat character-based, action-fiction centering on a low-level, yet punctual, FBI agent who works in the basement of the White House, for some odd reason, for the singular purpose of manning a phone that could be manned anywhere in the world that never rings so that s middle-man FBI agent can then dial 911 for the caller, thereby delaying a critical response from emergency services -- until the night that it does, propelling him into a unrealistic slow moving and pointless conspiracy that we're promised (or warned?) ultimately leads all the way to the Oval Office of a White House which is occupied by a political appointees clerk who busts the balls of the Intelligence services because they somehow know better. Forgetting that the real FBI is currently an incompetent yet political branch in the real world, this agent who saved hundreds of people from a bomb on the subway was somehow demoted because he had words with appears to be an internet TMZ. This international conspiracy thriller that takes place between FOUR characters will have you on the edge of your night's sleep. Unfortunately, what must be budget cuts or a pre-occupation with covering for the friends of Jeffery Epstein, no additional FBI agents could be spared to save the city?, world?, a small pre-K class? From becoming the next victim of this husband and wife terrorist team! If there's ANYTHING ELSE, short of a test pattern, I'd recommend you watch it instead.I'm not sure what show these other people watched and then rated, but there's NO WAY it could've been this garbage.Oh, and the unnecessary number of times the girl's name ""Rose"" is used in every other sentence of dialogue coming out of the main character's mouth rivals that of the pointless and annoying number of times Leonardo De Crapio used in Titanic.",1
"Not very often, but every once in a while, I will see something about which I had few if any real expectations that is way better than I expected. The Netflix limited series, ""The Night Agent,"" is just such a ""something."" I was unfamiliar with both the novel by Matthew Quirk on which it's based, and also the two leads, Gabriel Basso as FBI agent Peter Sutherland Jr. (also the son of a deceased FBI agent-and a suspected traitor), and Luciane Buchanan as young cybersecurity expert Rose Larkin, whose aunt and uncle are actually being murdered as our story begins. Peter and Rose are the only characters we're pretty sure we (and they) can trust, as we are informed that (a) White House mole(s) is/are involved in the two deaths and the subsequent lethal pursuit of Rose. It could be either of Peter's bosses: the WH Chief of Staff, Diane Farr, (played to absolute perfection by Hong Chau!), or FBI Deputy Director Hawkins (portrayed by the reliably dislikable Robert Patrick). Or it could be the chief of the Secret Service, Ben Almora, or Vice President Ashley Redfield, or might be either one of the two Secret Service agents assigned to protect Redfield's loose cannon of a daughter, Maddie, who is convincingly played by Sarah Desjardins.By now you should've surmised this is an action thriller with a lot of suspects and a variety of moving parts. I will admit to being engrossed in these different characters and their evolving relationships with one another right from the start of the first of ten episodes. I can usually predict where most plots are headed, but this one-well, not so much. I rate the show a strong 8/10 stars, subtracting a star because Basso is only so-so in his lead role, other than realistic hand-to-hand fight scenes; but Buchanan's Rose more than makes up for him by evolving from cowering in a closet from would-be assassins to bum-rushing a heavily armed one and shoving said assassin off scaffolding to a bloody death. Peter spends at least four episodes protecting Rose heroically (and energetically), and then their roles are at least partially reversed and Rose saves Peter from more than one deadly attack (once, memorably, swinging a 2x4). So anyway, by the 10th episode we're hiding in the back of a Range Rover and converging on Camp David trying to stop an explosion (as it happens, two high-intensity ones!). A satisfying ending and clear setup for a S2 for ""The Night Agent.""",8
"This is a Netflix funded burn notice without the plausibility or action. Every character has extra drama without the benefit of actual depth. The entire series is based around an incomprehensibly incompetent FBI agent who clearly is inept and his will be girlfriend who is also too naive to survive any actual life events. If cosmopolitan wrote a spy thriller, this is it. I can't imagine there is enough depth to create a second season or even attempt to spread these characters any thinner than they already are. Anyway, would recommend if you don't care about plausible events or general common sense.",2
"This show is full of action and secrets. It starts with a murder and a top secret room that has a phone. The person behind the phone is the main character along with the person who calls it. The show is good and worth watching. You have your typical president, vice president, other higher ups doing notty things. Typical conspiracy theory writing about things that could happen but very unlikely. Is their a room in the white house that ops call in for help probably. However that agent would never leave the room to rescue someone. Do I think high level officials do corrupt things probably most humans are corruptible and flawed.Either way the show is worth watching over a weekend.",8
"I am shocked by the bad reviews, thet dosent make any sense. An amazing Series that will keep you stuck to the screen! Amazing script great actors highly recommended. I finish seeing the entire season in less than 48 hours. There are a lot of surprising twists in the plot. If you liked thw series 24 with Jack Bauer you would defintalily like the night agent with Peter Satherland. This series easikiy get round 10 score - it gots everything. So if you recently looked for a good and enjoyable thriller this is the series for you so go ahead and watch it. Hopefully, there will be more seasons up next. ??",10
"This had such promise but this was undermined by the lazy writing, the incredulous story strands and some not inconsiderable need to suspend disbelief.Luciane Buchanan as Rose was the standout star of the series, with Hong Chau deliciously likeable as the f-bomb dropping Chief of Staff and the bonkers Ellen played by Eve Harlow.Sadly most of the actors seemed to dial in their performances with the ""thriller by numbers"" script, I often expected them to break the fourth wall to explain what was going on such was the ""narration"" like writing.What could have been a great series was severely let down by so many aspects, it's bizarre that it's been recommissioned.",3
"I went in with no expectations and was pleasantly surprised to see a great political action thriller from Netflix. Its a rarity these days that such good shows exist in Netflix that doesn't take us viewers for granted. It's obvious the makers didn't take the lazy route and the standard shows in writing, acting and the action and the execution. I could have easily watched the whole show in one sitting. Special mention to the lead actors - Gabriel Basso & Luciane, their charisma and acting keeps you hooked to the end. I for one am looking forward to a second season. I never thought I'd enjoy to this much. Give this a go, you'll want more of it by the end.",9
"It wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. The actor who plays Pete seemed a little bland. Like one of those actors who doesn't really have range and just seems like a mongaloid. The girl was decent. She showed some range. You believed her performance. DB Woodside is always a win. I love these political thrillers. It opens your eyes to the things that could be possible in real life. But I won't make this review political. I thought it would have more intense and explosive action sequences. The dialogue was smart and I thought the plot twisted in ways I wasn't expecting. Tbh I thought I had it pegged out from the beginning. However it's nothing like shows like ""The Old Man"" or ""Bourne Identity"". I love Shawn Ryan and was a huge fan of ""The Shield"". However this wasn't even close to being as good as that show.",7
"It was a little above average however - Netflix movies and shows are getting to be easy to predict as essentially any white man is going to be the villain or a bad guy in the end (other than main protagonist if they are white). Same here and it makes it hard to make an interesting plot / anything surprising.Overall, other than the plot there were good action scenes, but ok dialogue. The main character is likeable despite his dialogue. Many scenarios seemed unrealistic/ made little sense if you thought about it. If there is a second season the secret agent angle looks interesting. In that season I hope the drop the Netflix tropes.",1
"I understand that this is just a show (on Netflix) and not a big blockbuster with a big budget that could afford a crackpot team of experienced and intelligent writers. But still. You'd think that they could have cooked up a better script than this. The lines that they have some of the characters say just make me cringe. For example, when Rose (Luciane Buchanan) learns that her aunt and uncle have been killed (which she witnessed, by the way), her response is, ""No. Everyone loved them."" And this line is not delivered as one might expect: with great anguish or tears or anger. No. She just says it rather woodenly. When the agent (Gabriel Basso) is attacked by a pair of conspiracy-addled morons, their lines and their acting are just so cringe-worthy. Then there is the very obvious attempt by the writers to craft a situation where the Handsome Agent (and yes, he's very handsome and hunky) gets put in very close situations with a pretty female, the woman that he is supposed to protect. This just smacks of cliché to me. We see it over and over and over. In fact, after just one episide, I feel that I have already seen this show and I don't want to watch the rest of it.",4
"I managed to get through the whole series just to see what the end would be. What annoyed me most was the moments between characters that dragged the show and added no value to the main plot. The moments between the ""killers"" of them wanting a regular life. Why add that to the show !?! Moments between the agents guarding VP daughter, why did we need that !?! I was always annoyed at how two of the most important people in the main character life dies , she never cries, never mourns ?? Very weird . She annoying. The agent she's with acts like some inexperienced teenager though likable. It's watchable but it's weak. Plain n simple .",5
"So the premise is that they think he may
have planted the bomb after he, chases down the guy what did it and can give the authorities a pretty good disruption BTW , once you saw the close - up ofthe snake tattoo.... You Knew he was going to lose him ... so predictable it was annoying .Now it goes onto 1 year later..... let's give

Let's not interview the lady on the train who saved

saw him find the bomb...really?And let's have 2 thugs try and beat him up because everyone beatb up FBI agents
right... Lol
get some writers who were born before 2O10 please...I can't watch this show after 35minutes into it.",2
"It's alright. The acting and the whole cross departmental conflict feels super hoaky. It just feels forced and cheesy and over played. Is that really what it's like? I suppose it probably is, it just feels really forced.Honestly that's all I really have so far, but the app insists on me giving you six hundred characters (not including spaces apparently which is just silly). I do not need six hundred characters to get my point across, one hundred characters is plenty enough.Lorem Ipsum bah dhghd bccs disagree dig fnd jkkg hbansnn when.

"Main Story is entertaining, Side Storys are so-so, some even completely out of place and add nothing of value to the story, others are decent...The Who is who of good and bad guys in this plot wasnt really too much a mystery, even with some effort to blur it plotwise. Some decisions taken by characters to get the plot along seem quite stupid or out of character, which was disappointing - but thats todays studios and storywriters.Some characters:POTUS - ofc it has to be a woman, it actually adds something to the story, but overall she is not really of consequence - the actress doesnt really has too much screentime, given performance is decent.Chief of Staff - a typical netflix diversity cast, ive no idea who thought that this actress could pull off this role. My honest Opinion: At no point i got convinced that this character could command others, she talks tough, she seems clever but i dont really believed it - hard contrast to the female lead btw - this is were this series lost most of its potential imo.Assassins Pair - interesting choice, a bit cliche and wierd side-story to reenforce a already establish psychotic psyche on the female - overall good harmony between these 2 and good enough side character depthMale and Female Lead - they carried the show, good synergy, overall good performance, established characters with strengths and flaws - BUT WHY FOR CHRIST SAKE...why HAS there always to be a romance between the lead actors?... EVERY GODDAMN TIME - its just unnecessary, it adds nothing of value, its just in the way...Overall Summary:
Not the best, not the worst series, u can definitely enjoy the show - much thanks to both lead actors, hope to see more of them in similar roles.",8
"While the plot line was mildly entertaining and interesting, the acting in this series takes a new level of bad. There is more animation and life in a Kohl's mannequin than the actors chosen for the series. Instead of trying to make sure he had every hue in the diversity rainbow he really should have spent the money and hired real actors. Shame on you Shawn Ryan. The man who created The Shield comes up with crap like this 20 years later. The plot line 2 was far-fetched in many cases, and the series was about three shows to long. It is difficult to believe that Netflix is going to have a season two of this. I truly hope they get totally new actors. Rarely do I root for the bad guys to kill all the characters, but in this case, none of the characters had any socially redeeming characteristics. And the female lead to play the presidents, Chief of Staff was especially awful. Her bland face delivering lines was almost painful to watch. Likewise, the hero of the story is not someone that you would really give a darn about.",2
"I enjoyed this series for the plot, twists and turns, and fast pace. The production value is good and the script, while full of holes, keeps things moving at a good clip. But boy is some of the acting bad!Gabriel Basso basically carries the whole thing as Agent Peter (Sutherland, Sunderland, I can't recall). He's very solid, charismatic enough but not too swaggering. The actress who plays the Veep's daughter is quite good, as is the one who plays the sexy evil hench-woman. Most of the rest are OK.But the grieving tech genius AKA love interest, Rose, the Chief Of Staff and the Secret Service agent who protects the Veep's daughter? None of them can act their way out of a paper bag! And they're all key characters. It's a perpetual problem. They don't improve as the show goes on, either. I don't get it. Do they have a bad casting agent, a bad director or could they just not afford decent actors?Anyway, Basso carries his co-star enough that there is decent chemistry between Rose and Peter. So, the show works. But it's frustrating to watch so many of the actors struggle to emote. So, watch for the action and plot twists. And Gabriel Basso.",8
"Peter Sutherland stops a train bombing, then gets blamed and harassed by a conspiracy-theory group called ""the Patriots"". He gets a call from someone who narrowly escapes a murder, which leads to multiple plot twists and turns.The story could be interesting, but it should have been a 5 or 6 episode series. Instead it drags on with juvenile dialog between the main characters, and interruptions to explain back story after back story. The relationship between the main characters develops as expected, and the professionals in the government do not behave in believable ways. Like the secret service agents on the case who stop to have a personal conversation while turning their back on the people and location they are investigating. Disappointing.",4
"Spoiler Alert***
I'm not sure what people expect in a fictional spy thriller. I mean it could've been written better but it could've been worst and I feel the show maintained the pace it started on then speed up a bit.Yes, glaring improbabilities - from lack of security and facial recognition not picking up the face of a man (Peter) accused in kidnapping- what are we expecting - just sit back and enjoy the impractical monster-ride. Hey laugh and shake your if you have to but I enjoyed the show immensely and I have only one thing to ask?Can the producers do a spinoff prequel with Ellen and Dale. To begin with I can't remember any assassin kidnapping a baby just to be convincing just to get in a home. Those two were ridiculous but deadly. I know they seemed a little flat but I think the show itself - through directing instructions may have reigned in on range of emotion. Give them their own Origin limited series . Thanks!!! And yes I recommend this for those who want to binge for the night.",8
"The action scenes in this show are credible but this is no Jason Bourne thriller. The characters become unbelievable in the second episode and go downhill from there. The Night Action storyline could have worked if anyone on the production team had ever worked with or around sensitive compartmented information (SCI) procedures. Or sensitive compartmented information facilities (SCIF). This show is the result of someone's imagination of how such things might work.Direction is lazy and the acting shows it. Both protagonists and antagonists are working too hard to show their credentials. The only redeeming quality of this show is the action choreography. It's not bad at all, and would thoroughly entertain my 15-year old nephew if he could make it past the dreadful dialogue. Adults used to Bourne, Reacher and Ryan probably drop it after the 2nd episode.",2
"Tried to watch this with my brother last night. And, It was another Netflix abortion! How are these people still employed?The Good: The production values were competent. And, I think the original author was involved.The Bad: The short answer is everything not listed in the good.The writing was atrocious! It was painfully bad and hugely annoying. My suspension of disbelief felt like it was gang raped in a prison shower scene. In order for fiction to work there has to be a grounding in reality. There was no grounding, nor any reality. The characters did what they wanted for no reason and never acted like any human beings on the face of the Earth... ever. There are middle school student writers doing better, more realistic work.The acting was subpar. I know these jokers had no script, but still... The words that came out of their mouths made everything worse. I felt so sorry for Robert Patrick. There have been actors in the past, given terrible scripts, who were able to elevate the words through talent. Peter Cushing is a wonderful example. There was no such talent here, not even a little! They just made it worse!!It hurts to even think about the time I spent watching this mess.Do yourself a favor, unless you're super stoned or about to pass out drunk, give this a miss. The best thing about this show is the advertising and the artwork.",3
"Like others stated, the writing is very bad: Top secret stuff is discussed everywhere, with anyone. Not very believable. Or maybe it is, in these crazy times.The female lead is especially badly written. And also, the actor is very bad. Kind of like a budget Michelle Rodriguez: 1 facial expression all the time. And it's always grim. Even towards the guy that saves her life multiple times.Writers need to understand: this is not how you portrait a strong independent woman. This is how you portrait an annoying, know-it-all, bad mood pain in the butt, that the audience doesn't care for.And what's with all the out of place swearing? Cringe af! Not even in the heyday of macho cinema in the 80s/90s, would this have passed for cool or dope.This is a missed opportunity. Because the first episode was promising. But the female lead and the bad writing ruin it all.As also other people stated, Netflix cancels a ton of shows that the audience does enjoy. To, in return, give us this kind of cringefest that is really not enjoyable, even if you are open minded.Thus: If ever netflix cancels pw-sharing in my country, I'm cancelling my subscription.",3
"There's action series and then there's B & C grade series. This falls in the C grade category with a joke made out of something like Secret Service and the Whitehouse. The female lead does everything in this, from TED talks, to threatening and going against the White House chief of staff, medical assistant, save the hero(a FBI agent), fill assassins and what not! Ends up even saving the negative character by ""putting a pillow on her wound"" to ensure she gets saved and gets Jail????
The assassins kill everyone with ease and FBI agents, cops, other spies can't defend, but who saves the day? You guessed it, the female lead.The female assassin is brought on by the other guy just a couple of years back, is lame as hell, but then also turns into a sniper, all the while being one of the most silliest assassins we've seen these days.I mean, I don't get what's with the crazy load of bad acting, clubbed with a sorry story, it's like everyone tells off the president, her chief of staff and whoever else while being civilian, a basic agent or whatever.There's hardly anyone addressing the president as ""Madam President""????
The amount of silly stuff is comedy gold!I see other ratings, but have suffered with this, it's what could pass off maybe 15-20years ago, but baffled at how high this is rated now??
Watch at your own peril????",1
"The script is basic, there are way too many plot conveniences and character protections, furthermore the actions characters are forced to carry out venture into the unbelievable. However, despite the series suffers from a lack of originality and limits itself to recycling genre clichés, the story is agile and intense, which makes it an attractive option for lovers of espionage. It's about a conspiracy movie/series throwback involving two lethal killers, a bombing in a subway, a mole within the White House and a newbie FBI agent who's in over his head. Well acted though lacking in originality. Not that bad.",7
"I understand that taste is subjective, but the fact that some have given this show a rating of anything below a 7 just goes to show how spoiled some people are, and how demanding they've become in what they expect from a show. For sure, TNA isn't going to change lives or mindsets, but it was well put together, the two lead characters had excellent, natural rapport and were absolutely NOT just a couple of pretty faces; they acted really well. Most of the supporting cast were great too - with the exception of the assassins, who were just awful in a ""trying-too-hard-to-be-different"" kind of way. The writing was on point, as was the plot and pace, with sufficient twists to keep you interested. Give this show a chance; ignore the 4 and 5 ratings - very unfair, to the point of being ridiculous. It really should be around an 8, but I've given it a 10 to offset some the spitefully low ratings some other hard-to-please people have given. Watch the show.",10
Try not to look into the reviews too much as you'll be wasting away. I'm so glad I watched this as it's to date the best series of the year so far. I loved it and it would be truly magnificent if we can be ever so lucky and get a season 2 to see where the journey ends. I was looking long and heard to find a series similar to Designated Survivor and this just tops it all off it is brilliant.I hope you enjoy the watch like I did because I simply couldn't take my eyes off the screen. Call me a conspiracy theorist but I bet a lot goes on in the real world so maybe we got a glimpse of the real world.,10
I was reluctant to watch but so glad I did!There are very few series today that would keep you in the edge of your seat and this one does it quite well. The acting is solid and the action is non stop from start to finish. I loved the stories and the chemistry between the characters and here is a rating for some of the key elements:Chemistry between characters: 8.5/10 especially liked the two assassins doomed love storyAction sequences: 9/10 everything is so well set up and can be made a movieActing: 9/10. Yes there are some defaults there but overall very solid and casting is perfect especially with the secret service detail.Story line: 9/10 because of how it unravels and keeps you engaged in every episode. Yes there are some weak story lines but it all comes together beautifullyI hope there is season 2 coming and I really hope they keep it fresh and good like this season.Go ahead and watch it and disregard all the negative reviews.,9
"It's interesting, it took me about a week to finish this show, and when I started it was an 8.1 on Netflix and now it's a 7.6. The show reminded me of 24, even with some of the old school major network type production values which aren't quite up to Netflix's normal standard but not terrible. It was a compelling story with twist and turns that kept pulling you along.The story and the overall production is an 8 at least, but there are WAY too many plot holes and faux pas that are jarring for such an otherwise well done series. From the beginning of the story there is constant tension and the main characters, Peter and Rose, are in constant danger. So many of the faux pas relate to casual occurrences in a story that otherwise was filled with tension and drama and Peter and Rose being with high alert. To wit:1. Ep 4 Peter and crew were so casual preparing to invade home of killers. Rose just sitting in car in plain sight. They didn't even put her in and make sure doors were locked.2. Rose just sitting in plain sight in cafe, no effort to disguise even after Peter texted her about a BOLO.3. Peter stealing Diane Farr's passcard while she was in the night agent room. Her first instinct when she left would've been to pick it up since she always puts it down. And who puts down such an important card all the time??? No way. You wear it around your neck.4. Killer couple goes into unoccupied home for sale and nonchalantly key in the passcode on the interior alarm console to deactivate the alarm. As if the owners would not get a notification on their phone about the code being turned off. Absolutely ridiculous.5. Lorna also has a keypad inside her home. I guess everybody in this show has technology from 10 to 20 years ago.6. Lorna wears a knife around her calf, and keeps shotguns by the front door and grabs one when somebody knocks on the door, but doesn't have a gun nearby when she's sitting in her living room qnd intruders come to the house. Nuts.7. Peter comes in a hotel room and doesn't lock the door when he and Rose are in danger.8. VP approaches his daughter's dorm room and ask the guarding secret service agent if his daughter is in her dorm room. What do you think, the agent is neglecting her duty and guarding an empty room?9. And why did you come to her room if you didn't know whether she was there?10. And where are YOUR secret service agents? Nowhere in sight as you approach the dorm room.11. Ep 6, Cisco says it took him two months on Bumble to convince a girl for a first date, and the first date was going to be at his apartment! Completely asinine.12. Ep 10, Arrington finds the bomb with 3 minutes and 43 seconds remaining, but instead of taking it into the woods where nobody is, she tells people to evacuate the building. That is nuts.ABOUT MY REVIEWS:I do not include a synopsis of the film/show -- you can get that anywhere and that does not constitute a meaningful review -- but rather my thoughts and feelings on the film that hopefully will be informative to you in deciding whether to invest 90-180 minutes of your life on it.My scale: 1-5 decreasing degrees of ""terrible"", with 5 being ""mediocre"" 6- OK. Generally held my interest OR had reasonable cast and/or cinematography, might watch it again 7 - Good. My default rating for a movie I liked enough to watch again, but didn't rise to the upper echelons 8- Very good. Would watch again and recommend to others 9- Outstanding. Would watch over and over; top 10% of my ratings 10 - A classic. (Less than 2% receive this rating). For Lifetime Movies for Chicks (LMFC), drop the above scale by 3 notches. A 6 is excellent and 7 almost unattainable.",7
"The series is just what you expect, but in a bad way. If you have seen any movie about White House betrayal and espionage, you know the plot and the villains of the whole series in detail after 20 minutes.The whole thing is absolutely medicore except for the acting, which is slightly worse.Filming, directing are OK, fighting scenes are also OK except for scenes where people are playing tough agent parts for politically correctness reasons only.The only positive surprise is that although conversations are not exceptional, sometimes these is a witty response that is really original and funny.Expect many movies like this once AIs will generate scripts and virtual actors.",6
"Being an avid spy thriller enthusiast, i am quite choosy of the series or movies that I watch in this genre. Well in this case, I can definitely say that it's one of the best spy thrillers of recent times. There are plenty of boring, same type of series/movies being released every month in this genre but trust me its built different.Highly unpredictable with 'n' number of plot twists and with strong+Convincing acting.The storyline is very good and the end does justice to the entire series. The sub plots are foolproof with almost no loop holes. I liked the fact that the story has many dimensions to ponder over and almost each episode has it's own hero. All I can say is, welldone!",9
"There are thousand of spy movies around, it's really hard to create any twists that can surprise the audience. The great thing about this show is, it just focus on the story telling, the journey of the 2 main leads. It doesn't try too hard to come up with any crazy twist that doesn't make sense just for the sake of shock value. The story progress natural, it's exciting to watch.Even though it's a typical perfect hero saving the world, I'm fine with that because there are such perfect human exist at a younger age.The show is exciting to watch and the action is really good. Love the cast, every one is great. I binge the whole thing in one go.",8
"I enjoyed the first episode, however the series quickly went downhill.Beyond the the two main characters, the acting and script are horrible. The antagonist are cartoonish in dialog and acting as well.After watching four episode we have decided to remove it from our que and not watch again.I have no idea how someone could find this enjoyable.And, I can not believe that it has been renewed by Netflix. That is my opinon and I am sticking to it.Apparently, you have to write multiple paragraphs to have your review posted, but honestly I seen no reason to exert any more than the minumun effort.",2
"Why all the hate? I get it - the acting isn't Oscar worthy, the effects aren't a masterpiece. However, what you do get is a fast-paced, easy-watching show that leaves the viewer thoroughly entertained.If you want a decent show to watch, choose this and you can thank me later!Here are the 5 things I loved most:
1 - the twists and turns to the series aren't completely predictable
2 - (potential spoilers) - the good guys and the bad guys get hurt and killed. None of the usual 'heroes can dodge all the bullets and kill with 1'
3 - (potential spoilers) - there are very few times where I was left screaming at the TV due to a stupid decision made
4 - all of the characters (minus the VP's daughter) were genuinely likeable
5 - there were no episodes that just filled time. Each one lead to something more.Enjoy!",9
"The series as a whole isn't bad, but it's not great. Everything about is just mid level enjoyable. It starts out with an interesting mystery. Why were two seemingly normal people killed and who did it? Obviously this turns into your usual political thriller, minus the over the top political messaging moat shows have these days. The action scenes were good, but there could have been more. People showed injuries after them. There wasn't any messaging that I could see leaning one way or the other politically which was nice. But other than that, the show was just there, not awesome or amazing. Coming from the guy who made the Shield, one of the best shows ever, we got this giant bowl of blah. The last episode descends into Fast and Furious levels of suspension of disbelief. The main character should have died six times over and yet doesn't. Overall it's okay.",5
"I must say, though not great, this was an enjoyable watch for me. The writing and story were entertaining, even if they did require some leaps in logic that fell short. The two leads worked well together and had good rapport and chemistry; I look forward to seeing them in season two. On the whole it was fast paced, and the tension kept me interested in what was happening.On the down side, that same tension sometimes took too long to build before it was released. Additionally, the assassins received too much screen time and character development. Past knowing that they were hired guns for the bad guys, I didn't care about them at all. Yet, for some reason, the writers wanted us to get to know them.Even though I liked the series quite a bit, one of the things that left me a bit cold was the trail of bodies... seems like just too many people died over the course of ten episodes.",7
"Okay, cards on the table, I'm only about 10 minutes into the first episode, but I was truly blown away by the lack of realism in one of the first scenes. The MC is sitting on a bench, waiting for an emt to check him out, when he spots the bad guy in the crowd. He says more than once, ""that's the guy"" and then runs after him, but none of the many police officers around follow him or even engage at all, including the cop who was JUST talking to him? And then he gets into a fight with the guy a couple blocks away, and fires his GUN several times, and STILL no cops come rushing over to assist? I mean, there's suspending disbelief and then there's just nonsense, and so far this is falling squarely in the latter category. There should have been at least three cops following him the second he identified the guy.",4
"I don't think the acting is as bad as the script and direction make it out to be. The supporting cast seems like they would be solid if they had some good material and leadership, but the main character, later by Gabriel Basso, is miscast. He comes off as wooden; boring.I watched Perry Mason on HBO directly after this show. They have the same score on IMDB currently, but I'm telling you, if Perry Mason is a 7.6 then The Night Agent is a 4. The quality of these two shows are not even close to comparable.The plot and subsequent actions require much suspension of reality.The good: A strong cast of female characters in non-traditional roles, led by Fola Evans-Akingbola. Still, I'm not sure if it's enough to give this one a go.",4
"I don't normally write reviews, but after laboring through a few episodes of this and seeing that it had a 7.6 rating, I felt compelled.It must be bots. There's no human who would watch this and go ""yeah, that's a 10"". I understand that opinions differ, and I don't expect everyone to share my opinion of this show being complete garbage, but the number of 10/10 ratings is an obvious absurdity.See for yourself. Watch the first episode, and realize that the first 20 minutes are as good as it's going to get. It's all down hill from there, baby.After a few episodes, I walked away with a renewed appreciation of my own free will.The poor writing, the inept actors sprinkled throughout, the saturation of clichés that hit the ear like a satirical copy-pasta... it's just too much. A child could write something with more depth. The suspension of belief required for this movie to not seem deliberately absurdist is on the same level as the Tooth Fairy and Easter Bunny. The whole time I was thinking, ""surely the main character is about to wake from some bizarre dream"", yet it blundered on.I'm sure some could enjoy this series, but not I. Despite myself, I'm sure no adult-minded flesh-and-blood person could possibly think it was flawless.",1
"First, everyone sounds like they are wearing retainers. If the production wants to test mouth worn microphones, they should do it with a B movie or train the actors how to sound natural. Also, they should go ahead and fire the consultant that was in charge of the military personnel. The marines tending Marine One can't even snap a salute or wear uniforms that fit. The show is good.... but it was executed badly by a direction team that just barely failed. The actors are MOSTLY good....the VP's daughter is too dramatic, and she seems to be forcing it. The Secret Service agents are not believable, and they killed off the only one I liked. Other than that, not bad.",7
"Netflix often confuses me with its production. While they put great amount of effort in the visuals, often the script falls short. The night agent sadly falls under the same category.The cast is not bad, I enjoyed watching most of the characters in this show, apart from self absorbed vice-presidents daughter's security detail which does not lose any opportunity to throw awful annoying punch lines and show everyone how she is really good at her job. Another set of characters that seem a bit lost are the least efficient hitmen on the planet. Their story seems absolutely not necessary and relevant to the plot. It's a poor filler that leads nowhere.The WH escape scene is hilarious, and although shot well, it just does not fit in the show like this. It is not an action show, it is a spy/conspiracy Jack Ryan kind of plot. You can't pull out a few scenes that are complete nonsense and think you can get away with it.It would be fair to mention some positive aspects of this show, and why it can be worth your time. The pace is good, directing is excellent and the score fits well and adds to the tone. If you don't want to overthink the plot and character decisions, you will enjoy it.",6
"First of all I'd like to say that I don't think this series is meant for high critical thinking and top class writing, I think it's just an Action flick that kinda feels like reading a nice James Patterson Crime Novel or the like , It's not meant to be a super clever series like True Detective but kind of something like Reacher which as much as the series has mild writing and predictability, the fight scenes are okay and the action can be fun, it's certainly not a 8-10 series in terms of quality but it's pretty good for casual watching to say the least, It's the kind of shows you can watch with anyone and most people enjoy and that's okay.",7
"This series feels like the TV series 24 - very fast pace and exciting, creating suspense one after the other. You will get hooked up since ep 1. There will be different questions you have in mind after watching first few ep and you need to be patient to find out little by little through out the episodes even until the last episode.I finish this series in 3 nights - I am so engaged to watch!The only bad thing is too many interesting characters need to die - could they just be injured and live? Would love to build up certain characters and learn more their stories.I also wish there will be more hand to hand combat but this is just me!",9
First. I love spy/ FBI movies and tv shows. This is one of the worst I have ever seen. The writing and the acting are terrible. Mostly the writing. You can feel the actors cringe as they say certain lines. There are some redeeming qualities like Rose is a strong character but her lines are awful. Not the actresses fault. The hero has the same issue. The villains are flat and one diminutional. I honestly don't understand the positive reviews. Are people just bored. It was like watching a train wreck. Hong Chau was terrible and completely unbelievable. As was the actor who played the VP. The love story between the assassins was just filler and unnecessary. I wonder what is going on at Netflix. So so bad.,1
"I guess there is only one group of people who are not offended by the lack of good writing, the countless plot holes, the stupid decision making of all characters: fans of deep state conspiracy theories. Yes, it is fast paced and a bit thrilling, enough to keep you going for a while, but there is always some insult to the intelligence of the viewer around every corner in this show and it makes me angry. The by far worst thing though is this ridiculous love story between these assassins. Okay, I get it. These people are usually faceless drones in any show, giving them personalities could, in theory, be nice for a change. But please, not like that. I just skipped these parts. They felt completely out of place. I could go on and on about all the glaring holes in the storyline but that won't convince anyone to watch or not watch the show. So, to sum up, I keep it simple: this show gets worse the more you think about it. If you prefer not to think, this is for you.",2
"When has anyone been able to see who is driving a in car behind them at night? How do assassins miss the car parked just off the end of the road? Who buckles their seatbelt before starting the car to chase after a target? The Night Agent has weak writing and low believability. So many characters make crappy tactical errors it's embarrassing. I do better counter surveillance walking home from the bar at night. It tries to be mysterious by bouncing around a timeline which only serves to look like it's trying too hard. The acting is good considering the material they were given. Pick a different ""Night"" for better thrills. I suggest the Night Manager.",4
"This is the laziest and most basic screenwriting and terrible acting that I've seen in a while. Took all the worst parts of a CBS drama and mixed it with uninspired ""cinematography"". Get ready to yell at the screen because 90% of the decisions made by the characters, so called professional agents, are devoid of logic and basic intelligence for the sake of the script.Constantly following characters that will essentially have zero impact on your understanding of the character, constant random exposition dumps, 90% of which are completely unnecessary.Fast and furious has better suspension of disbelief than this.Awful.",2
"The leading actor was very well prepared for all the action scenes and obviously he spent lot of time with the gun in the past. The fighting scenes were very moderate and realistic. The script at some point seems like improvised, because some part of the plot were predictable and suddenly took a direction to another predictable outcome, but still was filled with enough intrigue which kept my attention to the final. The acting was good and I think Gabriel Basso has a bright future in front of him. At the end of the day it was one of the best described conspiracy series I've ever watched and it was made realistic in terms of the circumstances and actions that would simulate such an event.",8
"Wow I really liked this show! It was an amazing serie. It was a serie of 10 episodes (plusminus 45/60 min per episode). All together it felt like a big action movie. I thought it was so exciting and refreshing. Good and (new) actors. I feel like Gabriel Basso and Lucian's Buchanan both did a good job. I was also a good script. Most of it was action, a piece of romance and a huge plottwist to me. I couldn't stop watching it and I almost bingewatched it. I didn't even get distracted on my phone.. I would definitely recommend this to everyone. Have fun!.I hope there will be a second season!....",10
"BEST SERIES I HAVE EVER WATCH HOPE SEASON 2 WILL ALSO BE GOOD AS SEASON 1. THE SEARIES HAS THE BEST SCENES ALSO GREAT SUSPENSE TOWARDS THE VIWERS WHICH MAKES ME TO WATCH IT EVERYTIME ON REAPET
I HAD GREAD TIME WATCHING THIS AND NETFLIX IF IT CAN REALESE SUCH SERIES... I KNOW IT WILL GWT ALOT OF SUBCRIBERS EVERYTIME.HOPE WE GET A SERIES THAT HAS A SIMILAR SUSPENCE AS THIS THIS ONE
I LOOK FORWARD FOR THE NEW REALESE OF SEASON 2 OF THIS SERIES OHHHHH MY GOD SO WISH IT COULD BE LOT SOONER THAN THE STIPULATED TIME THAT I FIND ON THE INTERNET.AND THEY DONT CHANGE THE CHARECTERS BECOUSE THAT WOULD BE A BAD MOVE.",10
"This started out as some background noise as my wife and I did chores but quickly became a must watch show for us. For the most part the scenes are pretty predictable but the show kept digging deeper. The only part I didn't enjoy was the few attempted comedy bits but the action was really good.For those giving it bad ratings due to it being predictable, we've all seen White House conspiracy shows in the past and it's difficult to put a new spin on things. I walked into this show expecting it to have poor acting throughout but for the most part enjoyed the acting of almost every single character.",8
"This premise was so promising. I was expecting something akin to ""Bodyguard"" for the US, but what I got was stilted dialog, pedestrian fight scenes and boring car chases. There were glimpses of what could have been-the source material is probably worth checking out-the occasional dose of intrigue and excitement, a touch of suspense here and there. However, it was obvious to me at least that there was no budget for the multiple camera angles and quick shots with handheld cameras that would have given this show the ""Jason Bourne"" treatment that would have made it so much better. It felt like a Season 3 Netflix show instead of a Season 1. Let me explain: Netflix notoriously cancels shows after the third season-they figure the IP is unlikely to draw in new subscribers so they cut the budget to the bare bones, the quality bottoms out and/or they have to film fewer episodes. Honestly, this show would have been so much better if they focused their budget on better production values and fewer episodes. I thought it was cast well and have seen many of the actors do great work in other shows, so the only real explanation is that Netflix did not give them the budget they needed to make a really good show. That's too bad.",5
"As someone who enjoys espionage and cybercrime-themed movies, I was looking forward to ""Night Agent."" However, I was thoroughly disappointed. Despite its 7.6 rating on IMDB, I found this movie to be a complete letdown.Firstly, there were several gaps in the plot that left me confused and wondering what was happening. It seemed like the writers did not fully flesh out the story and left loose ends that were never tied up.Secondly, the acting was less than mediocre. I found it hard to connect with any of the characters, and their interactions often didn't make any sense. It was as if they were reading off a script, with fake emotions attached. Watching it with a spouse, instead of sitting tight & focused, we were often laughing because of that.Thirdly, the technical aspect of security and hacking was complete nonsense.The good things? Visuals and the plot idea. Idea - not its execution.",2
"Nowadays it's so usual to watch the first episode of a new series hoping they got it right, only to get disappointed pretty fast. This show seemed to work almost fine as a political/spy thriller but started piling up clichés and awful characters faster than the speed of light. Peter, the protagonist, is your usual rookie who knows better than his elders, to prove once more that this was written by some millennial. At least the actor playing Peter is decent and his role, albeit predictable, is sort of OK. Unfortunately, the female lead Rose is terrible from every point of view because her acting chops swing from poor to non-existent, she has one stone-faced expression, zero range, and no chemistry with the male lead. As if poor skills weren't enough, her role of entitled, smug, arrogant, know-it-all is absolutely obnoxious. By episode two I wanted the assassins to get her.The Asian lady playing Diane is also wooden and expressionless, with minimal range, except bossy and again, her role is totally unsympathetic. It does not help that her vocabulary is peppered with F-words that don't add ""grit"" to the character, just cheapen it... and her wig is absolutely terrible. Then the assassins are a bad copy of those two in the Americans and THAT show was BRILLIANT, but changing wigs does not equal smart spies as in the Americans. The self-righteous, arrogant female bodyguard is just the icing on this third-rate, rotting cake... and obviously who's guilty, but the compulsory old white males?Apart from the awful bunch of stereotypical leads and supporting, the plot is the usual conspiracy at the top level which will be thwarted by the low-ranking agent and smarty pants Rose. I give it two only because the first episode was watchable, but it went downhill from there.",2
"It isn't the best series but it has a lot of good actors. There's a few questionable actors like the chief of staff and the assassins but other than that the acting is good.By Netflix's recent standard of series, this is a decent one. I think the bad reviews are the ones who expect a high end budget on everything and expect Oscar winning actors.The only thing I struggled with was understanding who was who in regard to the bad guys in the White House as all the men sort of looked the same and they only ever used surnames to identify them.All in all, it's a good watch and you can binge watch the lot in a day. The story isn't bad either and it's easy to follow and it isn't too unpredictable either.",8
"Ok, first off... Where did the writers go to school for their craft? If they didn't it shows, if they did, they should demand a refund.Secondly, regarding the protagonists, the assassins, I could give two flying ?? about them, especially the female one. She was borderline manic, psychotic, and 100% unlikable.The female Secret Service agent is 100% useless and fully unrealistic.The loopholes were big enough to fit the moon though, forget a mac truck. Support not existing, the secret service not doing background checks on people, and there is NEVER a time they are not around.Secret Service would not allow the VP's daughter out of their sight like they did. Whoever played the VP's daughter was way out if her depth. Nevermind every e else.I mean seriously, the rest of the characters are as two-dimensional as they come. They all could have died and the series could have been done with and I still wouldn't have cared.I honestly can't figure out how this got a continuation beyond the pilot... If you want a drinking game for every time you see something stupid happen, this isn't it. Because if you do, you'll die of alcohol poisoning.",3
"Add more fight scenes pls, hope this show last at least 3 to 4 seasons or maybe more cause I love this show so much. I'm excited for the second season to be released. The story is so great it's not basic although plot twist is obvious in the middle of the episode but the details are great. I wonder what will the main character will become in the rest of the story. I hope his character becomes even better specially his skills as a knight agent. I have nothing mutch to say I just wish there was more fight scenes. I also want to see his back story more deeper. Overall great show that's why I put 9.",9
"This had everything I have come to expect from a Netflix series.The core of the story, the basic conspiracy, is not bad, but it is so badly written. Especially the dialogue, which comes off as having been written by AI. The last few episodes in particular had me actually laughing due to the sheer preposterousness.Like the final episode where no one seems particularly concerned that all the comms are down at Camp David and our main characters are free to roam around, even letting one of them take the president as hostage at gunpoint, culminating in the female lead running around like a chicken with its head cut off with only one soldier lazily attempting to stop her. I don't know whether to blame the writing or the inept staging. But how was this made by the man who made The Shield??But the main culprit is the acting, which is horrible all around. Especially our wooden leads, who have the chemistry of a wet blanket. But the supporting cast are no better.And of course it had to be 10 episodes long, regardless of whether it has enough story or character development to fill ten hours or not, as per usual for a Netflix series.",3
"Mediocre, at best.I like Gabriel Basso. He's the primary reason I chose to watch this. I liked him since I first saw him in Kings of Summer, and I thought he did a great job in Hillbilly Elegy. However, nothing about that bad script gives him, or any of the other actors for that matter, anything to work with. The plot twists are mostly predictable and the dialog is a heap of clichés stacked one on top of the other.The fact that this is about a government agent assigned to protect a female figure of national importance in a high stakes political thriller, but mostly the beginning with him stopping a terrorist attack on a train draws an immediate comparison to the acclaimed BBC show Bodyguard. However, The Night Agent pales in comparison to its British origin in every aspect. The story is less interesting, the characters and their motivation not as convincing and over-exaggerated at the same time, and their relationships weaker. And it's also missing Richard Madden's Scottish accent, but that's a terrible loss that every other show has to deal with, so you can't blame them too much for that.",4
"This is more of a 90s vibe thriller in series form. Lots of action, chase scenes, non stop plot twists and turns. Yes maybe like some viewers commented, you need to suspend disbelief at times, but who cares?? It was so entertaining!!! I have missed this kind of action thriller, as they are not made like this these days. The ones out there are harder in terms of action and gore and so implausible that they just make me laugh. Yes the body count may be high here but it isn't overly graphic or gory. It was extremely entertaining. Also the main characters were likable and relatable and definitely not stupid. The acting overall was great!! I hope there will be a season two of this show ????",9
"With the abundance of Netflix shows these days, went into this with low expectations and to just take the show as it comes. If you do that and just enjoy the storyline and twist, you will enjoy this show!It gives similar entertainment to 24 with the developing plot lines and unrealistic speed of the plot developing but you just have to enjoy it and not try to think it's realistic.The acting was solid all around and they did well to make you guessing the whole time. The twists and flashbacks made it entertaining.I'm hoping more people will watch this and appreciate this as they need to make more shows like this nowadays.",9
"This is bad. It is like if you took one of the worse seasons of 24 and god rid of Keifer Sutherland as Jack badass Bauer and also took out all of the cool action. The boss is an asian lady. Ooh how progressive, I'm so impressed. It is just your typical modern Netflix garbage where the characters and story are generic and predictable because they care more about political correctness and propaganda. I can't think of much more to say because I only saw one episode but that's all I needed to see. I really just wanted to make my hilarious pun on the title. The main character is boring too. He is just so dull he should be called Jack Bore because he's a Bore. Another hilarious pun, I just can't help myself. This show sucks.",1
"Very predictable love story, but certainly not reality. A young woman just takes over an FBI case with no training, no restrictions, or enforcement from above? Hard to believe. The side love story is totally predictable too. It seems that the tables have switched - now the male characters are the weak ones, which I always thought was true anyway (being a woman). Maybe I'm too old and cynical, but this does not deserve the viewership it is getting. I have watched several episodes because my husband likes the girl, but he is normally the type to prefer real spy shows, and now even he has to admit it is disappointing. People must be hungry for escapism.",4
"I only managed half of the opening episode but in that time there had been a train bombing, several fight scenes, a home invasion and a car chase so this is definitely an all action show. Unfortunately there isn't much of a plot to stitch the action together nor are there realistic or appealing characters. Particularly anoying is Rose who is the definition of the damsel in distress who absolutely can not do as she is instructed even though her life depends on it. There's probably a plot involving corruption in high office but with the emphasis on high paced action it's difficult to see the wood for the trees.",1
"The Night Agent is a Netflix series based on a cloak and dagger spy conspiracy story about an FBI agent played by Gabriel Basso who foils an attack in Washington DC. He is assigned to monitor the calls of a phone line that hardly ever rings till he gets a frantic call from Rose Larkin played by Luciano Buchanan. The storyline dives deep into the plot with a few twists that lead up to the Oval Office. It was full of action, bad acting, and full of cliches. Robert Patrick acts as a top level agent who throws Peter under the bus. D. B. Woodside played an FBI agent who covers the VP's daughter while Hong Chau acts as the Presidents Chief of Staff who has her own agenda. Hong has been steady growing in popularity and acting in mainstream media. The series was intriguing in the beginning but dwelled off course. Alan Arkin directed a few of the episodes and Kari Matchett played Madame President. If the story continues, I hope they come up with better acting.",7
"Have seen too many of these Whitehouse themed conspiracy series' and movies, but this was full of action, way too much violence for me but some others may like that kind of thing. I did like the male lead Gabriel Basso who fit the FBI role perfectly and of course he was handsome - since there was a little romance involved that was necessary casting - good looking, smart, capable and he did portray all that. I have seen better scripting recently with short series - Beef for example that kept your attention every single episode and made you want to binge watch but this one not so much. Enjoyed finishing it but it wasn't like I wanted to binge watch it.",8
"The story was gripping enough for me to binge it and see it through, but it certainly takes a massively large willing suspension of disbelief to allow it all to happen. If this were an anywhere near accurate reflection of our federal security and law enforcement services, we would be in deep trouble. The performances were decent but the actors were not given a whole lot to work with dialogue-wise. However, despite its predictability, the story keeps moving and keeps your attention until the end. It is a nice way to blow a couple of afternoons when you want rock-em-sock-em mindless entertainment.",5
"I watched the Netflix series and struggled to finish it. There were so many bad actors, inconsistencies and questions but, like I said, I finished it. Decided to read the book and there's no comparison! There are some basic similarities to the TV series but the book is so much better and more plausible! Why do directors/screenwriters change the characters, plot lines, dialogue, etc. From a book that is so well written? The actors who played Sutherland, Diane Farr, Sutherland's godfather, were TERRIBLE, just to name a few. Characters were altered to the point that they are unrecognizable. The twists and turns in the book were so well laid out and plausible, but were embellished/altered for TV to the point that it was ruined. Changing the killers completely changes the story, especially the way it was decided to have a couple as hit men, why? Didn't improve it in any way. Just stupid.",2
"From the moment you started watching the show, it was clear that something wasn't quite right. It was difficult to engage with the story or the characters, as both felt artificial and unconvincing.The show's cast also failed to impress, delivering performances that lacked depth and emotion. The actors struggled to make their characters believable, and it was clear that they were working with weak material. As a result, the show lacked the chemistry and rapport necessary to create a compelling and engaging viewing experience.Overall, it's difficult to recommend this TV show to anyone. While everyone's taste in TV shows is different, this particular show failed to deliver on any level. The writing was weak, the acting was lackluster, and the overall premise was absurd, making it hard to invest in the story or the characters. If you're looking for quality TV shows, it's best to avoid this one and look for better options.",1
"This is a straight up ""non political commentary"" & ""conspiracy mystery"" but it's definitely not entertainment.Every ""actor"" sounds like they are just reading lines with no effort to pull off acting. You get the sense that they're just there for the check.1. In episode 8 the opening Flashback makes no sense at all. Why the POTUS chief of staff would be on board with the cover up? She had no knowledge of the attempted Metro bombing or what it's goal was. Attempting to cover it up made it more ridiculous and stupid and ran contrary to her trying to save the administration. In reality they would immediately throw the Vice President under the bus with his super donor if there was any hope to salvage the remainder of her term.2. By episode 3 you know that at some point (episode 6) it's predictable that they'd make the Protagonist into the Patsy, and that he was being manipulated pathetically by the chief of staff.3. The fact that the protagonist would have a romantic development with his witness was more like Patty Hurst syndrome but obvious from the moment she called the ""Night Agent"".4. The psychotic female assassin, was the only actor acting.5. ""24""'s legendary President Palmers younger brother, later to be a second President Palmer, later to be God's angel ""son"" in ""Lucifer"" (smart drop by Fox) must be hard up for work to take on the role of a flat washed up Secret Service agent. Or as a character to teach people under 35 that they're immature and could learn from the ""old school""6. After episode 8 and the kidnapping rescue it makes absolutely no sense that the Protagonist would still be trying to prove his set up beyond a reasonable doubt.8. The fact that another attack would be planned on US soil after the Moronic logic behind the first wasn't conceivable. The Veep hiding in a bunker so the ""terrorist"" can be blown up with POTUS. Would be difficult to explain had the plan worked.9. The veeps daughter is too old & has no political ambition to care about her father going to super max to not expose it and drag the audience through 3 more tedious episodes. The nanny cam just showed he was a jerk as a father not something damning like sexual or physical abuse.10. Basically a totally implausible conspiracy story, humorless , horrid acting. To make it worth watching or even continue to watch after episode 4 unless you're bored, totally stoned & alone.The PC police turned ""Woke"" have simply made it difficult to put out anything sexual that's not interracial couples, or homosexual. Action is mostly female centric, overkill, (ergo the box office success of Jon Wick 4), and it's very difficult to make anything remotely comical.",3
"I agree that the first two episodes of Night Agent are fast pace and drew me in quickly. It had the feel of a good movie with the thought of espionage and dealing with national security... But I was disappointed once again in Netflix producing another film with poor language. The F word is in every scene and takes away from the plot. It makes the actors unbelievable in being learned public servants who work for our national government. I changed my rating from a 9 to 3 as I became sicked by writers, not knowing how to convey intense portions of the movie. Even if there is a second season, there may not be one for me. Come on Netflix - - do better. Lastly, I would have to say the leading actors are very solid, and the special effects were believable.",3
"Just finished the series, definitely a fun watch. The start was pretty flat in the sense that its very conventional, standard spy-thriller-ish. I wouldn't say the first episode would hook you. But the mid series twist did for me. The puzzle complicates, things are not as one dimensional as they seem. I like the focus on showing the perspective of the assassin/s. We see their face, we see them go about their lives, a touch of humanity behind those murderous hands. They're also people with beliefs, dreams etc. I like the involvement of the Secret Service bit as you'll see later. Camaradarie, loyalty, rebellion. The last episode went too Michael-Bay. Explosions for the sake of explosions. Didn't like it that much. The main antagonist's switch in motive was too drastic, didn't make sense, didn't tie into anything. He wanted to repent of sorts, then suddenly go all out with his scheme. The show completely failed to make that connection. This is after all adapted from a book if I'm not wrong. These two were the major downsides, but overall, stumbled upon this series as a break from watching something else, and I liked it still. 7/10, nice as something to pass the time.",7
"It's been a long time since I enjoyed a show this much. Usually if I'm watching tv I'm multi-tasking. Not so with this show. It kept my attention the entire way through and I binged almost all of the episodes in one evening. I was surprised by a couple of the twists. I like that they did t end it in the predictable way. Peter's Father really did what he was accused of and Peter and Rose didn't end up together, even though you want them to. The actress playing the female assassin did such a fantastic job playing a character who was pretty unhinged but then also oddly interested in having a house and raising g a baby (even if she did want to steal one from someone else). I'm looking forward to a second season but I wish we would see Peter Sutherland again.",9
"I watched all S1 episodes and, oh, dear me!Such a poorly written script would have been ""fine"" in the 90's or early 2000's (maybe) but certainly not at this time and age.Either predictable or as-is events..
to name a few:
1. The male protagonist's best friend (a nice and jolly fellow) is asked to protect the female protagonist from killers. Guess who gets killed?2. The male protagonist is with the female protagonist on a private boat in the middle on nowhere, hmmm..I wonder what will FINALLY happen next?3. The captive punches a wall (why?) that causes a hole and in that exact spot she finds a very important serial number in which she will later encode and hide in a signal/speech combo riddle inside a video message and eventually lead the rescuers to her location. Who wrote this particular part? I want their name, now!P. S Am I the only who couldn't take the Chief of Staff actress seriously? Especially when she kept cursing and repeating the clusterf@#& word?",1
"The Night Agent is proof that a series does not have to be great to be highly entertaining. I was forced to give it an 8, but at best it's a 7.5. It requires the viewer to suspend disbelief during its numerous plot twists: Agents who abandon their protectee no questions asked, gun battles at swanky hotels with nary a policeman or hotel patron in sight, universities that allow folks to simply stroll into the library with no ID required, etc. But once you overlook these things, it's entertaining, it's suspenseful, it's well acted, and the characters are quite compelling.The producers of The Night Agent have learned one important lesson: The more ethnically diverse your show is, the bigger and broader your audience is going to be. Accordingly, the lead female, Luciane Buchanan is a New Zealander of Tongan and Scottish descent; the female Secret Service agent Fola Evans-Akingbola, is a Brit of English and Nigerian parents; and the female Chief of Staff, Oscar nominated Hong Chau, is Vietnamese, but spent time in a refugee camp in Thailand growing up. While her character's constant stream of F-bombs has offended some people, I confess I got a kick out of it. All in all, The Night Agent is old-fashioned escapism. Leave your critical faculties at the door, and just enjoy the ride.",8
"Gabriel Basso is a strong lead in an extremely weak acting ensemble. The writing is simply lacklustre with no memorable lines that shows like Peaky Blinders and Bodyguard serve up to their audiences on a consistent basis. In fact, several lines of dialogue seemed to be lifted directly from Bodyguard. Richard Madden and Sophie Rundle are a much better pairing in a much more believable relationship in Bodyguard than the main characters here. For the most part with the exception of Basso, the actors are bland and have little nuance. In addition, the writers, in order to stretch the series to a ridiculous 10 episodes, expects the audience to have an interest in 2 brutal murderers who have absolutely no redeeming features. Skip this and watch BODYGUARD on Netflix instead.",5
"To be honest, The Night Agent is not as exotic as I expected but it is worth watching. The story is a little bit obvious but it is good enough to keep me watching with the twists and turns. Despite some weak points, it all comes together beautifully with the plot. The actor playing Peter Sutherland, the FBI agent is a solid and totally believable character. But in my opinion, the expression of the actress playing the role of Rose is remote and unemotional. Her facial expression is just the same in any situation. However, I like the chemistry between characters, especially the couple of murderers and all the actors are good enough to suit their characters. Overall, this series is a must-watch for anyone who loves a good action, thriller series and it isn't too complicated so you can follow it easily.",7
"Fun if you just go with the flow and don't think about it too much. Do not compare to the Bodyguard, that show was much better quality.Cliched and predictable. You just know that as soon as a character starts talking about his estranged daughter that he's going to take camping, that this character is going to die before the end of the episode. Check!Poor acting almost all round. The actress playing Rose doesn't change facial expressions during the whole 10 episodes. Scared, angry, about to kiss Peter, every expression is the same. There is zero chemistry between the leads.Cringey dialogue. 'My aunt taught me origami in this room'. Seriously!!Ridiculously poor decisions made by characters just to move the plot along. Makes the secret service out to be imbeciles.People just able to break out of the White House or into Camp David with no problem at all. I mean honestly, breaking into Camp David in the boot of a car! It was laughable.Rose breaks a glass door to reach in and unlock the door to get into the house. Then she locks the door behind her. Why??!! The glass is broken, anyone can just reach and unlock itthen she stares out the window and keeps staring even though the assassin is right there. She keeps staring until she's sure he's seen herPeter constantly yelling at people about his innocent father. BoringWhy was the VPs daughter still bleeding right through her bandages and trousers? Enough to get a heap of blood smeared on the bannister? Made no senseeven the premise of a single agent sitting in a room waiting for the phone to ring. Who answers if he's on the loo or having a meal break lol. I mean, it's an 8 hour shift!",5
"Yeah OK it is what it is - but - even allowing for yet another government conspiracy spy action show this one is beyond silly. 99% of their problems could all have been solved with a haircut and a $4.99 bottle of hair dye! No instead let an FBI agent and a supposed computer ""genius"" run around while on the most wanted list without even pulling up their hoodie. And I love it when people are totally alone and free to kill, car chase and fight within a mile of downtown Washington DC. Like there is ever a moment when someone else isn't nearby in a city. Sorry I hate this show and its characters too.",2
"I had many spectations about this serie... many of them are now in the trashcan.I know many people have left their hearts and souls working here, but it has tow big ballasts to succeed such as a good production: the director and the writer. Why?Let's start with all those unbelievable and unrealistic details in national security they represent in the screen. Yes, I know that without them the serie could end in one chapter. Well... That would be better.What a weist of time waiting for the (happy) end, for discovering the author(s) of the conspiracy... It's a cliche after another.Also, the cast have sirious problems because they have to do whatever the director and the writer say. So, into the story some characters change one day to other without logic.I've never been in the FBI, but I'm sure they have now the serie in the introduction course to show to the rookie ones all they have never must do.In summary... Sorry! Finger down.",5
"The plot itself is what drew me to watch this show. I love a good conspiracy thriller. It seemed as though it would be the perfect pick to binge on a lazy Sunday with a big bowl of popcorn.The opening really draws you in. I immediately thought, ""This show is going to be awesome!"" But then, halfway through episode 1, I began to realize how badly it was written.98% of the dialogue is wretchedly juvenile and cringey. The writers tried way too hard to try to make the characters' conversations hip and current and it simply did not work (at all!) and it showed on the actors' faces. There were plenty of moments when I was literally LOL'ing because the dialogue was beyond stupid and it was laughably ""painful"" to watch the actors saying that stuff. I can't fault the actors here. Bad writing is bad writing, and they had no choice but to work with what they were given.Sarah Desjardin's (Maddie Redfield) acting was awful to watch. I found myself rooting for her character to die because it was so bad. Gabriel Basso (Peter Sutherland), Luciane Buchanan (Rose Larkin), and Fola Evans-Akingbola (Chelsea Arrington) also had several brief instances of bad acting, and for these times it wasn't the dialogue's fault. Eve Harlow (Ellen), D. B. Woodside (Erik Monks), and Hong Chau (Diane Farr) stole the spotlight, in my opinion, as far as bringing their characters to life and delivering solid performances.The sets were on point. I feel like those were nailed perfectly. Most of the fight scenes were pretty good, but some had minor flaws that were easily overlooked.It's a good binge as long as you don't expect too much out of it (i.e. The dialogue). It kept me entertained for what it is and I looked forward to what was going to happen next at the end of each episode. I mainly gave it only 4 stars because of the dialogue.",4
"I got sucked in watching the first 5 episodes but unfortunately, the show degenerated after that. The two leads Peter and Rose are very likable and smart. They seem to do everything reasonable to stay alive and manage to be one step ahead of the thugs. Where it gets dicey are the supporting actors who are very one note and/or cliched. Actress Hong Chau who plays Peter's handler is miscast with a limited acting range. Eve Harlow as one of the hitmen is HORRIBLE. She overacts in every scene and is not at all believable. Fortunately, the reliable DB Woodside anchors the show with his straightforward performance. As does actress. Fola Evans-Akingbola as his co-worker. That's the problem...the performances are uneven and there are various plot holes and face plant moments. My biggest pet peeve is when a protagonist is being pursued by police as ""most wanted""...they walk around in public without hiding their appearance. HELLO...there is a bolo splashed in all the news and you walk around in big public areas without disguising yourself?",7
"The movie is so well written that there is no point you feel bored. Main characters have done justice to the story. The ending too was well narrated and suspense was good. It is highly unlikely that second season can be written as the first season closes all the loopholes and questions, unlike other series these days. Action is limited and do justice to the story line. The events were logical and suspense had good background story to believe. Overall its worth a binge watch for some mind games. I loved the leading lady who acted so calm and balanced under all situation. Love story that evolves is also doing justice.",9
"I have to be honest and say I did not make it through all of Episode #1. But already .... I knew.Maybe you think this unfair of me, and it could be you're right. If so, Enjoy the watch.To kick-off the series, our young FBI hero boards a Washington DC subway train. Matt Damon-like, he is square of jaw but with twinkle in eye. This noticed by a little girl with whom he kids around .... but suddenly. A man in a black hoodie slips a daypack under a subway seat and departs the train. Our hero, his thoughts coming fast as running mud, figures out the 'What's Up', and as though moving through heavy water or Jello, he slowly makes his way to the pack, opens it, sees the bomb and pulls the Emergency Brake (yes, The Emergency Brake). The passengers somehow pry open the doors and screaming, enter into an active third-rail tunnel that looks as though it were badly constructed on a studio set, and .......Next, a young businesswoman has declared bankruptcy, and has come to live with her aunt and uncle. When the aunt and uncle are being murdered downstairs, the young woman calls a phone # she was given and gets 'The Night (FBI) Agent', our Damon-like friend from the subway. Over the phone, without knowing anything about her, he devises an escape plan for her down the house's lattice-work, into the neighbor's now-vacant house, into their closet ..... All this on the phone. And no, not a ZOOM call, no video, voice-only.And about the young woman he saves, she's unintentionally unappealing .....So. About thirty to forty minutes.But already, I knew.",1
"The Night Agent was so damn stupid, however I was entertained.Firstly, the storyline had a decent premise, but the execution was ridiculous. So many plot holes and absolutely unbelievable scenarios. It became somewhat laughable. I mean, really the leads just survived almost being murdered for the millionth time and are still being hunted, but they are ready to go to pound town.Secondly, the acting. Wow, it's atrocious! The lead actor wasn't horrible, but everyone else was monotone and stiff. Truly the actors didn't have much to work with, so I understand why they're so robotic saying their lines.Even with the unrealistic storyline and underwhelming performances, it was still an entertaining binge.",4
"No spoilers in this review don't worry!Honestly can't recommend you giving The Night Agent a try. I can't imagine anyone who would feel the need to give up on it. You won't regret watching this. Action packed, twists and turns, brilliant character development. All round outstanding.And even better, they've confirmed a second season is on the way.Been looking at the producer so I can watch other programmes with such umph, however this really is top quality so it will be a push.The most difficult part of this review is the number of required characters - if I could have written less I'd simply have said ""Watch it, you won't regret it.""",10
"I thought the show was quite entertaining at first and well written. Acting was above average for a series from Netflix with an exception of only one or two characters. Around episode 8, I felt the writing got a bit lazy/sloppy and ended pretty melodramatic.Only found a couple of times where scenes felt out of place or unnecessary. Sometimes it did interrupt the flow of the story and action. Also, I would have given more background on some characters - they would act and react oddly but would have benefited from knowing more about their thinking and their past to justify it all.Give it 7/10 for action and storyline.",7
"As many other reviewers have said, this is a competent enough drama and highly watchable. But you have to work hard at times to ignore the totally implausible plot.The story galloped along nicely for the 10 episodes and I binged the final 3 in a couple of days. But I was rather relieved when nothing at the end suggested a strong possibility of another series to follow. If there was another series, I would only watch it if the early reviews indicate an improvement in the writing.The acting of the lead characters was fine, and they coped well with the limitation of the script.Can't say I'd give it a strong recommendation but it's better than some other Netflix offerings.",7
"If you looking for a fast action thriller. Find something else. Poorly cast, poorly acted, and just not convincing for me as a thriller.It's all just so predictable, I guessed two of the characters involved in the plot by episode 2, I wasn't wrong.Story is weak, acting is weaker and some of the fight scenes are about as believable a televised wrestling match.Maybe I missed the point, maybe it was meant to be a comedy. Though I didn't find it funny either. Just Very disappointing and very boring.For this to currently have a 7.6 rating on here I find strange. As normally the ratings are spot on.",3
"The show is simply not believable. It started off with a great premise. But after about 30 minutes, I knew exactly where this was going. It is a stereotypical cop./bad guy show that doesn't fail to miss every single worn out cliche in the books. The simple fact that a victim, who has absolutely no law enforcement experience whatsoever, is even remotely allowed to be intimately involved in trying to solve the case, chase bad guys, etc., is so laughable, that it borders on a caricature of itself. Here is a woman that was victimized, no doubt, and is now, in essence, working as an FBI agent, sans the firearm. The Chief of Staff role is so one dimensional and flat, she too borders on a comic book character. Bad writing. Bad acting. Ridiculous storylines. One more thing, you know she and the FBI agent will eventually hook up. You can see that from episode one. As I said, predictable.",5
Myself and my husband binged watched this series while on holiday. We both loved it. The two leads are amazing and go so well together. The rest of the cast are really good too so great casting. Especially the two assassins. Spent some time shouting at the TV. It reminded me of the film The Bourne Identity. There are a couple of small plot holes but I think the rest of it makes up for it. It's fast paced and full of excitement and action. So pleased to read there might be a second season.For me I would have liked better music to go with it.I can't believe the really bad reviews. It seems like so many other shows it has lovers and haters.,8
"Please read this...I rarely ever write reviews unless I truly want to warn people (or excite people) about what they're about to spend their time on.I am utterly shocked at the number of positive reviews here, and ungarnered praise for a show that is shot so poorly, a script that is beyond amateur and a class of actors (with the exception of a few) that are so awful, they're a D grade at best.The creators try desperately to create a show like Homeland, 24, etc, but the script is so ridiculous and the cinematography is so bad, it's like watching a soap opera.The story itself could have been the backbones of a very good show had it been written, acted, and directed by a completely different group of people.The main actress (Lucianne) is INSUFFERABLE. She is NOT a real actress. She has ONE face for every emotion, a perpetual exaggerated ""shocked"" face with her eyebrows so high up and her eyes bulging out of her head to the point that it's completely distracting.Also, the idea that a Chief of Staff would EVER be in charge of a secret government intelligence operation is ABSURD.If you have any taste in TV and/or cinema this show is not worth your time. It's garbage.",1
"Well, the story has major flaws not the least being it is totally unbelievable.And totally predictable. Spoiler alert: Girl calls boy. Boy saves girl. Boy helps girl. Girl helps boy. They hook up. You could see that coming from episode one.The bad guys are revealed about the halfway point in the series. But you can figure them out midway through the second episode.Too much gratuitous bad language, f words in particular.Kudos to Evans-Akingbola as Agent Arrington. And kudos to the 24 alumni D. B. Woodside (Agent Monks) and Kari Matchett (President Travers).On the other hand, there is plenty of intrigue and suspense and action along the way.",6
"The action is decent. The acting is mediocre at best. The first three episodes were somewhat entertaining. Straight downhill after that. It just gets more convoluted from there. I know that it is television. However, couldn't they at least try to make it plausible? I started out optimistic because one of my favorite authors gave a good review. Now I am questioning his judgment. At the end, I felt like I had wasted over twelve hours of my life that I will never get back. I held out all the way to the end. I will not be looking forward to another season of this show. Disappointing product of an overly ambitious director/producer.",2
"This is a very ""Jack Reacher"" kind of story, just from inside the White House.It all starts small, but everything leaves a small trace.. and when you start digging deeper and deeper, things only get uglier and out of hand. It's quite a weight-y plot! With good lines, good pacing, decent action, very good actors, and (more importantly) an intricate and believable enough story to make it an enjoyable binge watch. Revelations and execution are quite satisfying.. though sadly, I'm sorry to think that the prospect of a second season might have affected the ending of this one (on a personal level).Still, it is a complete story and would easily recommend it to one that likes the genre and has space to fill.",7
"WRITTEN AFTER EPISODE 5 - Here is a series worth watching. The script is wonderful with all kinds of twists and turns, and some seemingly irrelevant stuff that isn't irrelevant after all. It's great that so many of the actors are relatively unknown so that you don't know if they are going to live or die. Performances are uniformly great with the exception of the President and Chief of Staff who don't live up to the high bar set by the others. It's the minor characters who are there for only a scene or two who really shine in this series.The photograph and the music are not up to the power of the script, so that's another reason why it gets a 9 instead of a 10.WRITTEN AFTER EPISODE 10. I dropped the rating from 9 to 8. Even thought about lower but didn't. Starting in Episode 7 there are continuity errors. One minor error is the hole in the wall which is supposedly hidden but then appears in one scene when it should still be hidden. This is minor and forgettable if there were not major continuity errors in later episodes. I don't want to reveal these lest I reveal what happens, so take my word for it and you probably won't notice anyway.",8
"The plot, the dialogues, the characters are all extremely cringy. It's like a teenager wrote the script. There are too many plot holes that doesn't make any sense. The villains somehow always know who Rose and Peter talked to and their locations, and it's never properly explained how they got those information. The villains, especially character of the two assassins chasing after Rose and Peter are portrayed as stereotypical Disney villains, which is SO CRINGY. The lengthy romantic love story between them and how they want babies is unnecessary and cringy. The acting is also extremely cringy. Waste of time.",1
Kind of crazy when you think one phone call to some guy sitting in a basement cause all the chaos that it did I like this series from episode 1 and then when he meets the girl that changes his life it's a pretty good roller coaster of a series it's crazy to think I'll cutthroat Washington politics really is there's a lot of people that you don't think will double cross you but you turn your back for one second and that's all she wrote A lot of good twists a lot of good turns some people that were dirty I wasn't expecting it so they had me guessing which was cool Hope they make a second series of this.,8
Spoiler alert.I'll summarise the quality of the show in the following example.In the last episode Camp David is described as a 'fortress'Cue scene where two protagonists get inside via the boot of a car.Cue following scene where door to 'communications centre' is unlocked with a bad guy insideCue scene where the President of the USA wanders along a path to a meeting in high heels with maybe two security guards around.This is just one of many examples where the script writers were not intelligent enough to come up with a plausible approach and sidelined any potential reality thus rendering the series as a sort of comedy attempt at a Jack Reacher clone.,5
"I thought that the overall plot was very good and refreshing as it kept us engaged from episode one through the last one. It was like watching a Bourne series on TV but without the super agent that Bourne was made to be. The characters were adequately developed, although a bit hurried esp for the female lead.The cringe part for us was that the ROMANTIC chemistry of the two leads just was NOT there... like, WHY? It feels so FORCED, at least as a romantic couple. They would have been better off kept as friends, like they were from the first several episodes. Hollywood-stereotype pressure? Also, although a fitting expert hacker, i guess, the lead female is almost notoriously and annoyingly a ""Nancy"" ... always snapping, always complaining almost all the time even when it's not called for? Dunno if directing or acting criticism.",7
"Think ""24"", ""Bourne"" series, ""Designated Survivor"", this show adds to a string of conpiracy/spy thrillers, most of which were much better.It's not really bad, but not exactly great either, although the first 3 episodes did look promising.It does have quite a lot of action, (car chases and the usual shootouts where nobody seems to hit anybody), even a few explosions, so that part is covered pretty well.The plot however, is definitely where it falls short, and the added twists (and there's quite a few of them), doesn't really help. Several of those twists can be seen coming from miles away.The acting, like the rest of the mess, is mostly average, and although it seems to be cleared for another season, I doubt that I'll be wasting my time on it.",5
"I went into this thinking I'd be bored out of my mind and that I wouldn't enjoy watching another action thriller about government espionage, and while the plot isn't necessarily original, the performances and set up kept me hooked the entire time. Rarely does a show keep me paying attention for more than 80% of it but I have to admit, The Night Agent had me on the edge of my seat multiple times throughout the season. I can't quite put my finger on what's so special about the show, but there's something magical there. Spy thrillers aren't typically my cup of tea, but this show has quickly made as one my favorites and I'm excited to see what else is in store. Fingers crossed they continue in the direction their going thus far.",8
A dystopian reality with a female president. Possibly her machinations have formed this reality requiring spunky and good looking agents.Oh how I long for the days of fat arse lead actors! Wtf 600 words.I had a puppy once and he was nice but he never toilet trained properly so I had to leave him in a dumpster for YouTube people to find!Never have I been so sad except when I threw some kittens in a bag for my girlfriend and she threw up because she is allergic.You know that movie with that rockstar fella? You know the first one that's a classic but the others you know are good but can never beat the first one!,5
Let me be honest most of the TV shows don't get excited from the first episode itself but this was different. The first episode itself had marked up that this show will be going to be a high stake and quite dangerous and thrilling story line. Especially the acting in this TV show was spot on by every character it was so Amazon that by the time you will trust a person by the next episode he will be your number 1 suspect yes indeed their are many betrayals In this TV show which can be annoying to some people but for this type of plot of thriller and suspense it is pretty dang good especially much recommended is the last episode is the best in class. There might be a few plot holes in first for the viewers but they will eventually get clear.,10
"I gave it 7 but at the end I think 6 was more than enough. The act was horrible, that gilt Rose ... she wasn't even look like she lost her family at one night , no sadness or shock appeared in his face. Sometimes she was acting and talking like it's a comic ?!? The plots were poor , unconvincing performance or stupid scenes. I have a feeling they wanted to make a copy of Night Manager sort of ?!?I gave it 7 but at the end I think 6 was more than enough.

"This is a mostly entertaining action flick, with an on and off again engaging plot marred by excessive f-bombs used to cover up poor writing.No joke, count on 20+ f-bombs in each episode.The main characters (Peter and Rose) are well played, but the supporting cast really struggles to be believable.There are also repeated suggestions (mostly overt but some direct) that support the world view that all white people are racist. If this doesn't align with your particular world view, you may not appreciate the injected dialog.There are definitely a plethora of suspenseful moments, but some are also quite mundane.If they removed the unnecessary profanity it could easily be more enjoyable.",5
"Kinda ok web series, nothing great nothing bad about it. But its long, waayyyyyyyyy too long than it should've been. Each and every character has some back story and a lot of dialogues drama, its too much. 8 hours for the story they wanted to tell is not something I'm going to buy the next time. I think if they had wrapped each episode within 30-45 minutes rather than an hour, would worth it. I expected more action, more thrills and that's where I got disappointed.Watch it if you have absolutely nothing to do, keep your expectations very very low and you might not get disappointed or else you can give it a pass.",5
"I'm usually very hard on writing reviews on IMDb for content I have watched, But not this time around . It's been a long time since I have enjoyed a series such as The night agent ,only minor gripe would be the overdone plot but even so it was well worth the watch.I thought all the actors were superbly cast and filled their rolls on this series with great drive and believability... kudos to all...
The production team ,camera crew, direction, writers ... And all the others I missed you made a fast paced rollicking great story for us all to watch... Quality viewing for a change, ... Netflix pay these guys more!!!",10
"This is one of those cases where the writers think that people won't ask questions if they just put together scene after scene of people running, cars chasing, guns shooting, and people hyperventilating.The cast is terrible. No one knows how to act. Action sequences have zero logic. Kind of reminds me of that Russel Crowe movie Unhinged. Incredible things are happening in the middle of Washington DC.....but where are the cops? The plot holes are so big that Crowse can take his gigantic pick up truck and keep driving though them all day.Sometimes, you can turn off logic and enjoy a thrill ride. This unfortunately, is not such a show.",1
"Undoubtedly one of the most entertaining shows I have seen in recent years.Maybe not a surprise since ""24"" is one of my all time favorite shows and this is very similar. The real time is not of course but plot wise it is.There are some complains about realism and of course but this is a show. It's meant to entertain. A lot of actions or whatever wouldn't take place IRL and that's probably true. But to me most of it works.One thing however.. and that is that the (second) assassination attempt on Omar Kadar and president Travers.It's possible that there have been a conspiracy we don't know about on this level IRL but for so many people inside the White House to be in on it and basically because of a disagreement.. I mean, that's far-fetched..However, to me the characters are generally good and at least to me they act with some logic to the story. If they don't, that's the most annoying lack of realism. To me.However, as I said, this is a great watch.9/10 and eager for season 2.",9
"The Night Agent is a must-watch show for anyone who loves a good thriller. The plot is engaging and keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The characters are well-developed and the acting is superb. The production quality is top-notch and the cinematography is stunning. Overall, The Night Agent is a fantastic show that I highly recommend to anyone looking for a gripping and entertaining viewing experience. Is full of unexpected twists and turns. The acting is not really superb but the production value is top-notch. Overall, The Night Agent is a must-watch for anyone who enjoys a good mystery.",10
"The series may appeal to those seeking a somewhat unrealistic premise - a beer-drinking age teenage actor from rural Alabama who takes on the role of a savvy intelligence agent.However, the lead actor bears a striking resemblance to Jason Bourne, and the plotline can be perceived as implausible and lacking in depth.Some may view the storyline as somewhat cheesy, and the overall premise feels dated in the modern era of entertainment.As viewers, we have evolved beyond the traditional tropes of FBI and CIA secret agent shows, and it is time for filmmakers to update their approach and offer new and engaging narratives that reflect the present day.",1
"Despite the idea of having one more story where the US President is threatened and that high circles of the state are rotten (...), the story, the action and the characters are pretty likable.Not only the president is a woman but a lot of the main and decisive protagonists are too, sorry for the good old male domination...The main character and his trauma about the loss of his father when he was a teenager is well used to accompany the whole unfolding of the story, as much as the primary motivation of the chief of staff to take the direction that she (again..) took !And that made a pretty good series I must say.",9
"No animals were harmed during the filming of this series, but many sharks were jumped. No spoilers here but this was both engrossing and completely silly. This was less frustrating than for example the Lincoln Lawyer (Netflix series not the movie) but it suffers from many of the same issues, a plot that makes no plausible sense, thinly construted characters, average to below average acting. Despite all that, it was fairly entertaining and you could do far worse than this. 421098765432109876543210987654321098765432109876543210987654321098765432109876543210987654321098765432109876543210987654321.",7
"Not the best show out there but definitely not the worst either. Keeps you occupied and watching, if you are willing to ignore the scrambled acting and plot points.The acting from the actress playing Rose is a bit stiff but then evens out as the series progresses, and the main character is played quite well. There are a lot of clichés and is predictable at times, but the fast paced nature of this show let's one to be immune to that.Some of the footage is a bit jumpy and cuts off at weird moments, which has much more to do with the editing than the camerawork. All in all it is a decent watch and I'd recommend it for a weekend binge watch.",8
"The UK's Bodyguard that aired in 2018 is so much better than this show. There is just no comparison.This show is really predictable and main character is not the best actor. Side note: He is obsessed with his father who was investigated by FBI and was found guilty by them. This guy or the night agent man (I am watching this right not and cannot for the life of me remember this guys/characters name. Anyway, he is a very bread and butter actor (IMHO). He makes speeches to other characters about his dad whenever he can--even at inappropriate times. I start laughing at him because he tries acting out all emotions at once: sad/angry/frustrated/unresolved questions/doomed for life if cannot figure out what happened to dad stuff.This series I will finish but I am on episode 5 and it is not getting better. It is not terrible terrible, but it is not very good either. Watchable for sure.",6
This is a good series with a good concept for a successful series but the acting is very amateur hence why I only have this five stars. I don't think this series deserves higher than a six. It is a typical Netflix series and slightly predictable at times. You need to invest time into this to get past the bad acting as sometimes it's very cringy and difficult to watch. The lead character is ok at best but that's all I would put it. I think Netflix needs to put more time into it's series in order to make them good otherwise it won't get another season. I was surprised at how popular this was given the acting.,6
"This show feels like 24 had a baby with any other of those ""1 man saves America"" cheesy movies.The acting is terrible, the dialogue is so predictable and one low key FBI agent with a tragic story saves America.The bad guys always teleport so quickly to the right place at the right moment (travelling through states like its nothing) and they seem to know exactly where to find the FBI agent, even in a huge university campus.Unoriginal plot twists, a lot of deja-vus and the incohorences in the story will give you headaches. It really feels like I'm watching a bad version of Jack Bauer going through the same corruption schemes of private corps funding political agendas.C'mon writers, get original ...",3
I'm halfway into episode two and so far the characters' reactions and next actions are incredibly predictable. Rose becomes clingy within a day and calls Peter on the super secure line just because she can't sleep. Give me a break. The storyline seems very forced with characters' actions rushed to push a dull plot along.The concept of 'show don't tell' comes to mind as well.So far it's easy enough viewing where you don't have to pay too much attention to follow the story.It was great to see Eve Harlow as an antagonist after her sweet portrayal of Maya in The 100. She's a great actress with potential to become a big name in the industry.,6
"Are you the kind of person who can suspend disbelief to such an extent that you think an FBI agent on the run and a computer tech could break into Camp David in the middle of a national crisis simply by hiding in the trunk of a car? If you are, this might be the show for you.This show is full of plot holes and implausability, the two leads have whatever the opposite of chemistry is, and the actin is wooden.Having said that, it is moderately entertaining, the plot twists keep coming (even if out of nowhere), there is plenty of action. Probably ok for fans of shows like ""Designated Survivor"" or ""The Shooter"" TV version.",3
"Since most tv series are so bad these days, its hard to know what I would have rated this 6 or 7 years ago because so much competition was out there. But in this day and age, i rated it 8. I found a show that had a reasonably good plot line, fast past and fun to watch the twists and turns.I dont think ive ever seen Gabriel Basso but I thought he did a good job in this show and he's very cute! ;)How did Diane Farr get a job on this show? Her acting was horrible! I guess they had to have the quota for diversity but there are many other Asian actors that could have done this a thousand times better. Really disappointed in this decision.All and all, enjoyed the show.",8
"Ok, it was a complicated plot with lots of subplots. The acting was good and action kept coming. BUT .. the lead is FBI. They are not bottom level fight/shooter trained. Most close three cases in 20 years. This guy is beating up Secret Service and trained assassins. By the end she is too! The computer geek becomes a fighter, even kills the lead assassin. Secret Service bad guys just slip next to the President with bombs. And the star beats up 50 guys in 10 episodes. Not gonna talk about the alphabet soup thrown in for no reason. And the evil twin. The funniest is at the end, him picking out the turned Secret Service agents out of a crowd! Hahaha, so ridiculous. It was good, just don't think too much.",7
I thought this was a great show! It's a convoluted spy series that had me finding the traitor then changing my mind then going back again to my original theory which was correct but with more involved. Peter was the perfect newbie to the game with a heart and rose was his perfect sidekick. She was smart and fearless and trustworthy and I hope they keep her in the series because she is great with him. They had a good chemistry as well as the banter and sarcasm. I think they played well off each other. I'll miss Diane because despite her behavior I enjoyed her toughness. I will anxiously await season 2 in the hopes Netflix doesn't ditch another good series.,10
"So yeah i finished season 1 and i need to say that i really enjoyed it. It have some classic things like the conspiracy, the president in danger, the personal conflict, the subplot andhsome revelations(Diane Farr, the real threat that the president is ). A nice season that have some cliché and some things already seen elsewhere but i really found the night agent interesting and tell us a story and let us discover the night agent institution with some conspiracy and stuff. I found the actions scenes well made and really give some tensions and made it escalate sometimes. That Night Agent Tv show was pleaseant to watch and i really spend a great time watching it and i will wait for season 2 for sure.",6
"We binged watched the 10 episodes in just under a week.I have to have,we really enjoyed them.Some characters need could skip season 2 in my opinion, But Peter and Rose carried this on their backs. Two young upcoming stars in the making here.Hats off to Gabriel Basso and Luciane Buchanan they've started something here.It's not Jack Ryan but it's got potential,and with season 2 showing here on IMDB. It looks like they got a chance to further and expand the story.Well done folks.I'm looking forward to season 2.Will we get Europe-Asia-Middle east?Will we get more in depth info on the night agents?I hope so.",9
The Story is clean cut and amazing fast paced .Never boring had difficulty switching off at 1am well but what really puzzel3d blame qas the behavior in the whole house l.Conspiracy and all but the setup was blunt and a blind person could see that's all a fake sobwas hard to finish either last few episodes.So when than everybody turned on him he falls in love mhhhhh.It's the violence and badness how people working in the secret service and how they been treated to obvious to be honest whoever watched 24 west wing etc always treated as criminals and they shoot on site every time.I found it to long the end could have been wrapped up by after the VP daughter has retunr after the spa the devil we know the last ep just a complete mushy and wierd.,10
"Concept is fantastic, but lacks execution. Maybe they're the wrong actors for the part, or maybe it's simply a byproduct of average directing, but for a show with a decent budget is hard to connect to the characters.I tried to push through, thinking the first episode is a pilot and maybe later episodes were better, but it wasn't the case.Unnatural performances, lack of smooth scene flow, jarring inserts of commentary and lack of subtlety in imagery and juxtaposition do nothing for the tempo of the show.I've seen some of the actors in other roles and was impressed by them, so this was very much a let down undeserving of the budget.A remake is in order.",7
"The actors who played Diane Farr and Rose Larkin have been played by bad actors, made worse by bad writing. Rose is a hacker with the same furrowed eyebrows and grim face in all her scenes. And she's a cliche hacker who can just tap a few buttons and get into any system. The actor who plays Diane Farr just doesn't feel the part for a Whitehouse honcho. Again flat face with a swear word thrown in every sentence to make herself sound bossy. Don't these people have families or things to do other than office work? The plot was far fetched, but would have led to a good payoff if they had invested time in the foreign leader and the POTUS. At the end, I just felt no empathy towards who lives and who dies. The only positive thing is that the protagonist seemed to a good actor.",7
"The story is pretty good but the actors/acting is subpar at best. It feels like Hallmark movie cheesiness, as if this was their first attempt at the action genre. The majority of the actors were not believable in their characters. There is an instance where a character has a leg injury and has to walk all over the place but the producers did not think to give this injured character crutches, so they have to hobble around for the rest of the movie in a manner which was not believable and, even worse, laughable. Better actors would have made this a Jack Ryan series competitor. Instead, it falls well short.",5
"""The Night Agent"" (S01, 10 eps, 45-min, Netflix) is an attempt at an FBI action thriller series but it's lacking a few key elements that warrant a middling rating rather than a high rating. This might be because there are 10, count 'em, 10 executive producers, so this is a tv show by committee and that may have been its core problem. The nut of the story is really good and it's got good production values, so this show had real potential, but it dropped the ball in its execution maybe because there are five directors (!) and eight writers (!), most with little/no experience. So once again, another new Netflix series is really just a gimpy training ground for rookies to get writing/directing credits at our entertainment expense and I am so tired of this being the 90% case - only 1 in 10 new Netflix shows are decent enough to watch to the end. Well I called time-of-death at episode three when it just got too stupid to endure further.",4
"Flat and inspirationless story with loads of gaps and held together with spit and wire.The agent saying that he's trained in evasion and other secret agent stuff, but then parks his car nose first towards the cabin in the woods, while they need to be able to make a quick getaway?The secret service superiors explaining themselves why they pull someone from her post and why the replacement is worthy of the job?An air gapped system allows to install a WiFi dongle without admin rights?The hidden disk is found by touching the first stone in the entire house?It's a just a little too easy sometimes, and unconvincing.",5
"A binge series on a rainy day when you at times let it run in the background while doing choirs. Zero character logic and childish character build, as if the writers have never met human beings. Some things are refreshingly unstale for an American production, though. I suppose this is all the next generation is able to build.Some of the dialogue is good, but most of the character build is based on some childish disney character book on what different characters look like. The main villain is obvious from the beginning and can be spotted by their physical appearance. Well, this is obvious to anyone who was born before 1995.",5
I binged on it quite quickly and was impressed with the narrative and Man From UNCLE/James Bond elements. Special rookie agent Peter Sutherland goes under-cover for protection and follows his own code of ethics.The acting is solid. Gabriel Basso reminds me of Matt Damon in Jason Bourne. The White House decor is very nice and the attention-to-detail on US Government stuff is excellent. It's refreshing to see a recycled theme done properly and with purpose and conviction.The character-driven element means it's more about the narrative than overuse action all the time. I particularly enjoyed the character build-up then the twists were well-executed and the screenplay was top too.I'm a huge fan of D. B. Woodside and his acting is stunning. He nails the security / FBI guard. Looks like the security you get at airports. The keen eye and the no-nonsense stare.Luciane Buchanan and Fola Evans-Akingbola are rising stars. I must say I was surprised by not knowing the majority of the casting list yet it really did work. The casting team did a fabulous job. It's also nice having actors play their actual age instead of someone considerably younger.It's also believable that the two leading FBI stars are 27 and rookies in the FBI this would certainly make sense. It's nice when TV shows follow real-life ages instead of casting someone a decade older for a teen show!The direction was great. I loved the script. It felt very 'prime time'. I guess there's scope for a second season but we'll never know with streaming services these days. It's made for fans of Jack Ryan; Man From UNCLE; James Bond and Jason Bourne.I don't want to disclose too much but it's a must-watch show.Great stuff!,9
"This series had a lot to like about it. The plot was formulaic yet enjoyable. The action sequences I felt were filmed well in particular the fight scenes. They had a real feeling to them. BUT the acting was what detracted the most here. All of the actors seemed like wooden soldiers. They expressed no emotion other than an occasional grimace. The worst offender was the actress that played the President's Chief of Staff, Diane Farr. Every scene she was in just sucked the energy out of it. There could have been a great action sequence that would have you believing this was one of the greatest shows since 24. Then.... She pops in and ruins any momentum. If there is a season 2 (and I hope there is) I pray they don't find some rationale to include her in it. Unless she's playing a marionette. That's about as good as her skill set can deliver.",8
"First off, I binged this show, so despite my critique it's obviously good enough to keep someone hooked.That said, it baffles me a bit how this genre of series is never brought to the next level. There are a lot of them (24, Designated survivor, Nikita, Bodyguard, etc) and they almost always have the same problem: badly developed 'bad guys'. A well-written bad guy as an understandable motive and takes logical steps to achieve their goal. The bad guys in The Night Agent don't have a clear motive, which kind of pulled me out of the series by the end because it became so obvious they were just bad because the plot required them to be.The writing is a problem for much dialogue, too. There comes a point were the leads supposedly try to charm each other with 'humor', but they end up laughing akwardly hard at very mediocre jokes.I also wonder why the director never told the lead female to act less like every traumatic event happening around her is only a huge inconvenience to her that requires to other emotional response than to be bitchy, and why the director never told the lead male to stop shouting out state secrets in public (as he is supposed to be a trained FBI-agent)",6
"The first three episodes are not too bad if you are just looking to unplug your brain.Episode 4 is starting to feel a little overstretched with unnecessary B plots and the bucket of paper thin characters recently dropped on the main story to turn the plot into an 8 episode show.By Episode 5, you won't be looking to unplug your brain, you'll need to be brain dead to enjoy yourself.The plot turns ludicrous; predictable twists abound and the show keeps borrowing here and there from other things in a way that seems less and less organic.Episode 6 is when the show just goes off the rails entirely... and there's 2 more episodes to go. WhewOverall, it's yet another example of what could have been a half decent thriller movie turned into a mediocre watered down 8 episodes show.",5
"I see reviews saying all of the reasons that this show is a dumpster fire and then ""but it's action packed 8/10."" No. It's just trash. Fast paced trash. Like an actual flaming dumpster but on wheels with a rocket strapped to it. Just because it doesn't put you to sleep doesn't make it any less terrible. I kindly ask Netflix to stop shoving this terrible show down my throat every time I open the app. It's starting to feel abusive and I may call Ronan Farrow if it goes any further. The acting is abysmal, the writing is somehow worse, and the logical leaps require a Jordanesque vertical ability to make possible. I hate it.",1
"The dialogue is terrible. I feel uncomfortable for the poor actors who had to read these lines. It is full of very cringy moments.So many eye rolling moments. People in these high positions would never act this way. Sure the real government officials are likely corrupt, but they would never do these silly things.Swearing thrown in awkwardly here and there.This is, unfortunately, a typical trashy Netflix show. I really wish they would do better.Overall it's a high production show with terrible dialogue. There is a huge disconnect between the quality of the visuals and the quality of the writing.",4
"Just finished binge watching this new 10 episode series on Netflix. ""The Night Agent"" It's a very engrossing, never a dull moment, wild ride of a series. Each episode will make you want to see the next. Lots of twists and character elements that will make you want to pay rapt attention to the details.For me, the one message that rang loud and clear throughout, was this statement, pulled from my own Security Clearance Report that is repeated over and over: ""This information is not something that could be used against him as a source of blackmail or coercion"". This is the crux of Trust that must be maintained and constantly held in check for anyone entrusted with intelligence that is Classified.Highly recommended film. I'm probably going to watch it again in a few weeks, just to refollow the narrative, now that I know the full story. Doing that always results in a litany of things that you didn't notice when you watch something like this the first time through. Each episode is about 50 minutes.IMDB is showing a 2nd Season in the Listing, so I hope it's true and will likely be released in 2024. (An election year, which in itself is interesting)",10
"This is another one of those shows that starts off strong but quickly degrades into unbelievable nonsense. Overall the acting is pretty solid (except for whoever plays Rose and Diane - holy cow are they terrible), the cinematography and direction is really good, but the writing so comically bad and unbelievable that they only way you could ever fight through the dumb is if you were on lots of drugs or severely intellectually challenged. Characters continually do totally unbelievable things that make no sense and by the time you get to the end the plot is so absurd it'll straight up make you angry. As someone else said, in todays world of awful shows this is better than most, but that still doesn't make it good.",4
"I found the show to be mediocre at best since the writing was obviously done by people with limited life experience. Contrivances, convenient coincidences and plot devices make this difficult to watch. The dialogue is CW level and nowhere near as good as it is on shows like ""the diplomat"". I honestly wanted to like the show but the dialogue is simplistic and there is too much stuff that just would not happen in the real world. Why would the White House Chief of Staff Be running FBI ops and have an agent in the basement of the White House answering the phone? The show is almost watchable but not if you have recently watched a similar show that was much better.",5
"First of all, it is filmed so darkly - literally dark colors - that it's very hard to see what's going on. Secondly, it's fairly predictable in the first two episodes maybe it gets better? But I lost interest squinting to see what was happening with my lighting turned all the way up.I was also not at all surprised at any point about where it was headed. The good looking square jawed guy is a big hero, rescuing the poor helpless woman. And someone getting chased or getting shot every five or 10 minutes. Somehow the surprises weren't at all surprising. I'm sure it appeals to young boys everywhere but if you're looking for grown up entertainment try The Diplomat instead.",5
"GoodI liked this mainly okay with some good action sequences and fairly fast pacingBadI did find the female lead agitating, argumentative and plain jarring most of the times. Yes the plot had holes that a bus could drive through that in parts felt implausible, and characters also lacked development and I found many hard to warm to.SpoilerIt was not surprise as to the revelation of the Chief of Staff but again the character development was as such that I didn't care too much either way. Unsure if this was bad casting or scripting, potentially both.Overall not ground breaking but watchable all the same if you don't pay too much attention to detail, just don't expect a great deal and you won't be disappointed.",7
"To hit the highlights, viewers will like the action. The plot moves quickly in some episodes with a cliff hangar that ends most episodes but, my gosh, the dialogue that hastily drives the plot-line is so contrived, predictable, cliche, and unbelievable that it is hard to watch without laughing. Suspension of disbelief is on notice here, but viewers can only disbelieve so much! With all of his experience, Adam Arkin is better than this script, and the screen writers that wrote this should take time to reflect on this bad writing! Come on! Writers are better than this effort! Netflix should start focusing on quality instead of quantity.",3
"This entertaining pseudo-thriller starts of a bit silly and get's progressively more idiotic in storyline towards the end, all the while remaining very entertaining as the cardboard characters ""act"" towards the trope laden finale.Despite the silliness I stuck with it for the pure fun value as the who dunnit messy plot veered around. Still trying to figure out how much bigger the boat cabin was on the inside than the boat was on the outside.It will be interesting to see where they go with season two now that most of the interesting characters from season one won't be available it seems for various reasons.",7
"Every single episode is watchable. I often take issue with Netflix series for dragging a story out over too many episode, but this is spot on. There is just the right level of 'are they a good guy or a bad guy', the lead actor is excellent, complemented by good acting all around. It sets itself up nicely to have another season too. It's fast paced and engaging, and it's interesting.The story isn't all given away early either, which is often the case. There are numerous sub plots that are well done. It is not over romanticised. The female lead is annoying, but it seems like this was the intention. It is corny at times, but this is one of the better offerings from Netflix for a while.",7
"Nothing really wrong with the acting. Just a bad story, bad dialogue, bad characters, bad plot. It's all cut by numbers, derivative, been done before. The guy that stars in it, Gabriel Basso has no charisma. There is a line where he referred to being a hot shot basketball player...ya, whatever. Luciane Buchanan is earnest but what a bad character.... She was a super sleuth IT person who's company went bankrupt. Ya. That is real believable. Neither person is right for the fictional character they portray. There is a nice cast of diverse actors, almost each one of whom seems wrong for the part in question, each one playing a stock character. VP's daughter...bad. Spy BF...bad. Secret Service Agents guarding her....bad.If this was not written by AI, and cast by AI...then I recommend strongly you try putting AI in charge because this is just horrible.I do not recommend this lazy stupid contrived junk to anyone.",3
"I was captivated by the thrilling plot of The Night Agent and found most of the characters to be enjoyable. Unfortunately, I was not a fan of some of the other characters. In my opinion, the show could have been more concise; the narrative could have been more succinct and some of the filler content could have been removed. The acting was quite good, and the special effects were decent, but I think the pacing of the story was a bit slow. Furthermore, I felt like the dialogue was a bit clunky at times and could have been improved. Nevertheless, the finale of the show managed to wrap up the plot points nicely, even though I think the series overall was overrated. The ending was satisfying, and I appreciate the effort put in to make the narrative engaging. Altogether, while I think the show could have been tighter, it was still enjoyable to watch and I would recommend it as a decent watch.",5
"Great story, engaging and cerebral with loads of potential to become a regular series for Netflix. The character of the actual Night Agent was very likable, with a strong moral compass and desire to do the right thing in service to his country. You're rooting for him throughout the series. Unfortunately, the character of Diane Farr is sooooo distracting you almost want to fast forward through her scenes. Whether it's her actual dialogue or the actress was ""over-acting"", Farr came off as overly dramatic and ridiculous. She had zero credibility as the president's chief of staff and more like a political wannabe begging for legitimacy.",8
"Diane Farr's acting is so bad it was painful to go through the whole show. The storyline with the two killers was exciting, they were good characters but their end was tasteless, without content or purpose, too bad ?? The end of the twin bomber didn't put more context or story either, there was potential there. It feels a bit bitter overall.Other than that it's a decent show, you wanna see how the story goes except you know a little bit too much 4 or 5 episodes before the end. It's a typical/good Netflix evening filler so I'll take that! Hopefully they don't push to a second season because I wouldn't watch more, 9 episodes of that was just fine.",6
"Watching this was very similar to the tv series 24. Lots of plot twists and turns and never knowing who to trust. If not taken too seriously this show is entertaining. The chemistry between the main character, (Peter) and the female lead (Rose) was good. Rose wasn't just some damsel in distress with nothing to offer. She actually helped Peter and they made a good team. No instant love story common in the 80s where the damsel is saved and helpless and of course sleeps with the main male lead, at least not at first. When they do have that scene later they at least have chemistry but one does wonder when you're the most wanted man in America how is that something even considered. Diane Farr was a little vexing as a character, since the actress who played her didn't come across convincing enough of her character. Same goes for madam President who seems a little young to be president. There are plenty of plot twists, unfortunately the story takes a while to develop. Even over half way through all the episodes you still may be wondering what everyone's motive is. It comes together in the end and makes sense and perhaps that just adds to the intrigue. Like the show 24 there are some absurd moments. For example Peter fights an assassin and as they wrestle for the gun only 3 shots are fired and yet the gun is empty when Peter goes to shoot the assassin. Also when a hand gun is empty the slide kicks back, which didn't happen, basic firearm knowledge. Also why is Peter not wearing sunglasses and a hat when he's blamed for kidnapping the VP's daughter is pretty stupid. Guess some people don't like wearing hats even when they're America's most wanted which leads to a confrontation with Meal Team Six or some Proud Boys. The assassins' story gets stale pretty fast as they constantly kill people. The audience is not interested in psychopaths or sociopaths, so why the show focuses so much on them is a little perplexing. The ending is absurd like most action shows are these days but who doesn't want a happy ending? It ends well enough and hopefully sets up a second season. As mentioned earlier if not taken too seriously it's an entertaining show despite some odd moments.",7
"Acting is simply horrible. With a few exceptions (Phoenix Raei, Eve Harlow, D. B. Woodside) everyone else is either horribly miscast or simply a very bad actor. The leads are unbelievable and simply laughable at times. The White House staff are ridiculously bad.On to the story, there are several holes in the story. I don't want to give too much away, but things happen for no logical reason. It seems like logic doesn't play a big part in the series. You can guess the main plot points after episode 3.All in all, the combination of horrible actors and mediocre storylines make this into a below average TV show.",5
"This miniseries starts out okay, with an FBI agent working in the basement alone in a room waiting for a phone to ring ... but which never rings ... until episode 1 (not a spoiler).Of course, the FBI agent is good-looking ... and so is the person who calls him ... and of course they are essentially the same age ... and ultimately attracted to each other et cetera et cetera et cetera. Oh, and, of course, they are both very brave and skilled at physical and computer stuff.The Asian actress from the overrated ""The Whale"" (Colin Farrell got robbed of an Oscar for ""The Banshees of Inisherin"") is in this as the White House Chief of Staff and while she's got decent acting chops she drops F-bombs throughout this show as often as she breathes.The show gets pedestrian, predictable and formulaic quickly. It's also overlong. I had to force myself to finish the last two or three episodes.",5
"Regretfully, I watched the entire series. It's hard to explain in a few sentences just how poorly it was all written, and the many technical errors from the show. One of the issues that was the greatest annoyance is the poor acting by certain roles, and mismatched characters. The two main ""assassins"" were terrible fits for the role, and even worse actors. Especially the female assassin. That was some of the most horrendous acting that I have before viewed - it was painful to watch. They were supposed to be elite hit men for a private contractor running black ops, a former navy seal. Yet those employed under his wing were the opposite of military turned hired gun. It seems one of the main antagonists was nothing more than a poorly chosen publicity statement.In the end the entire series is this: Misogynistic VP who Is an abusive father and mistreats his daughter. Not only is he abusive, misogynistic, and Republican, but he hates middle eastern ethnicities and is an unrestrained, hateful racist towards Arabs. The entire series you will hear him constantly belittle a rant about the terrorists and why a specific one needs to die. He's even willing to kill Americans and his own President to ""protect America at all costs"". How patriotic.The acting is terrible. The story line is terrible. It's lacks any sort of realism. The characters and their relationships were horribly bland... I definitely don't recommend it by any means.",3
"Just gonna make this short: the dialogue for this show could really have been written by chimps on their day off from the zoo.. I sure hope that these guys aren't on the current writers strike, cuz if they are worried about being replaced by Chat G B T?? Then it's an insult to Chat GBT..The actor who plays the guy in the basement, should have stayed there. What utter bull sh#t..Most of the other characters are probably embarrassed by being on this show.. The hitmen/couple can kill everyone in site except the 2 main characters..I tried to give this show 2/3rds of the episodes to see if it got any better, but alas it didn't.. I suppose idiots & dullards need something to pass the the time, but any intelligent person should stay far away.",2
"Title reference to the VP. Watch it and you will know why.This is a Robert Ludlum style - bad people in the whitehouse. Starts off good, but the acting. Oh my word! The acting was like a 10th grade play, during rehearsal. The story was sort of predictable, but entertaining. But it felt so amateurish.The lead character was ""ok""; the lead girl was much better. Everyone else: cringeworthy performing and scriptwriting.The location shots seemed very bizarre, as if there was no expense for sets - they just turned up at a parking lot to film action.The ending area, where a house was blown up, really looked like they had gone to Ikea for the set, and couldnt follow the instructions properly (as we all have that problem).I guess this was a low-budget item - I only vaguely recognized one character from anything else I have seen, so money was no object (i.e. It simply didnt exist).But it was ok, enjoyable to watch, just I hope they dont do a second series.",4
"Is this show worth close to 10 hrs of your time? I think most would say ""yes,"" but not enthusiastically. The basic plot line is interesting enough. The acting is good for the most part. However, it did feel like couple of the characters were miscast. There are several plot holes and sequences of events that defy logic.I almost stopped watching it couple of times throughout the show, but decided to stick with it. After finishing the show, the best way to describe my viewing experience is that I just watched a rough draft of a potentially very good show. There are actions sequences that definitely could have been executed much better and some other details that left much room for improvement. I just wonder what may have been if this show was produced with a bigger budget and with input from other talents and experts.",6
"Sutherland character was great but at the end taking over all super agents by himself is a weak storyline to end with
Rose Larkin character starting off by a timid girl to an attitude filled fighting and killing superwoman is. Very very flawed
President is a joke of a character
Could have been written far better

"Excellent plot very unique I must say. Peter looked and portrayed his part best .Loved Dianne Farr for her saving the day attitude and under all that emotionless character she still loves her dear friend Potus would've wanted her to be innocent though. It's exciting on many levels,characters are perfectly picked for their roles. I would have likes Rose to join the Secret service too. Can't wait for season 2 if there's going to be one. It's been a while since something so fresh came to our screens. Night Agent is the best action tnriller I watched thus far. Absolutely loved it .This was truely ,truely enjoyable to watch. I know for a fact that Rose and Peter wil display more romance in season 2.",10
"The Night Agent is a Netflix series that starts out with a decent premise but unfortunately takes a turn for the worse towards the second half of the season. While the show is entertaining to watch, it is ultimately let down by a script that becomes increasingly absurd and convenient as it progresses.The series starts out with some interesting twists that keep the viewer on the edge of their seat. However, as the story develops, it becomes clear that the script is more concerned with moving the plot along than maintaining any sense of logic or believability. Things seem to happen at the convenience of the story, which can be frustrating for viewers who are looking for a more grounded and realistic experience.The acting in The Night Agent is below average, with some conversations between characters feeling downright stupid. While there are certainly moments of tension and drama, the lackluster performances from the cast can detract from the overall experience.Despite its flaws, The Night Agent is still an entertaining show to watch, especially for those who are fans of espionage thrillers. However, it falls short of its potential due to a lack of attention to detail and believability in the script, as well as subpar acting performances. While it may be worth a watch for those looking for a quick fix of action and intrigue, this gets increasingly painful during the last two episodes as it ultimately fails to deliver a truly satisfying viewing experience.",4
"Storyline is good, bit over the top and sometimes farfetched (watch the ending...), but hey, so was the Die Hard-cycle... every episode ending makes you curious about the next one and that's a plus.But the acting is so poor, with, for me, mostly unknown actors, which could be refreshing, but isn't this time. DB Woodside and Eve Harlow are the pleasant exception.Between the main characters, our night agent (Gabriel Basso) and his female IT-partner, there is no chemistry at all. Basso resembles a young Schwarzenegger, and his acting skills are likewise. Luciano Buchanan is a walking cliché, sorry to say. The rest of the cast is mediocre at its best. The president looks like an office secretary, no offense. I could go on, but see for yourself.",6
"Hard to dislike a series like 'The Night Agent'; It has a decent, thrilling enough storyline, overall good acting, especially by the charismatic and efficient Gabriel Basso, has a cutely clichéd romance with good chemistry between Peter and Rose that add sweetness to the storyline ensemble and above all it flows entertainingly well, making most of us glued to the screen, while sometimes having our cell unused in hand, just in case!10 episodes that I hardly noticed flying by with an ending opening new and deserved horizons for Peter. Being separated from Rose by multiple continents doesn't seem fair though and I hope that they will be together soon again cause phone calls are not enough for me.Screenplay/story: 7Development: 8Realism: 7Entertainment: 7Acting: 7Filming/cinematography: 7.5Visual/special effects: 7.5Music/score: 7Depth: 6.5Logic: 6.5Flow: 7.5Action/drama/thriller: 7Ending: 7.",7
"Although the trailer left little doubt about the kind of slot-filler this show was I got fooled into giving it a try by the good reviews and now I will have to live with that mistake for the rest of my life. How naive of me.This is your usual unimaginative deep-state conspiracy thriller that hooks you with a big mystery to keep you engaged in spite of a tragic lack of inspiration. Poorly written, botched plot, cheap twists, cheap sentiments, appalling dialogues, embarrassing hand-on-heart patriotism... there isn't one cliché this show doesn't resort to to fill an episode. Even the action is so-so.Perhaps it's your kind of show and you'll have a good time watching it, but don't expect it to be anything else than factory-produced entertainment.",4
"Well this caught me off guard, I started watching it and before I knew it I was wondering if I could cram another episode in before bed.That's not to say it's the best thing ever, It felt like a high quality low budget production and there are some rather questionable scripting ""moments"". But as we've seen, you can have a truck full of money and still produce a complete stinker (looking at you Amazon & Disney).Overall it was a decent enough watch to keep me entertained. The two main leads do a good enough job and the script thankfully plants these two with their own strengths and skills that aren't encroached upon by the other. The male lead (whose name totally escapes me - sorry!!) I thought was pretty solid and certainly helped carry it through when other parts waned. Overall the script and story were pretty decent.It's no Jack Reacher (the series) but it's a good runner up.",7
"Cliches galore, terrible acting - 'Peter' is about as expressive as a washing-machine -, the worst lines ever written for a series - could only have been written for an American series ('I love my country', 'You take care of her, huh?', 'I couldn't (forget you) if I tried' among countless others), sickening patriotism ('the leader of the free world'), and gross predictability in all possible plot lines from the budding love story to the final countdown or patronising president who rewards the heroes of the day.The whole series looks like a washed down version of the British series Bodyguard. Even the heroes look alike. The only difference is that when one kept you on the edge of your sofa, the other just makes you cringe at all the happy coincidences (she's a computer expert, naturally, which is going to be soooo useful to thwart the bad guys' plan), the unimaginative filming, the incompetent actors' direction, and the total absence of tension or feelings.Waiting expectantly for the next season of Bodyguard. Hoping Night Agent will have a long night's sleep.",5
"We were looking for another political thriller to watch so we thought this might be worthwhile. I'd seen some very positive reviews so we tried. Wrong! The dialogue is ridiculous, the acting is wooden, the story makes no sense and we decided this 45 minutes into the first episode. Turned it off and went to bed. Don't waste your time with this drivel instead find a good British police procedural like Line of Duty or the excellent French spy thriller The Bureau. Why can't Netflix make a series for adults where the characters are more like real people and the story is intriguing not a rehash of so many previous series? At 2 stars I think I'm being generous on this one.",2
"From the first episode, I was hooked and couldn't stop watching. Binged the whole show in two days. Something just kept me watching this show, even though it has its problems and shortcomings. It's at times very silly and predictable and cliched. A lot of the story is very implausible and the hero as usual in American shows has very thick plot armor. Still, I enjoyed this show very much.Gabriel Basso was well suited to this role and his performance kept this whole show together. The other actors were ok, but nothing special.Overall, a very predictible and cliched Hollywood show, but still it kept me watching. Maybe that says something about the overall state of entertainment, that this show gets an 8/10 from me and is one of the better shows out there this year. Anyway, I'm eagerly waiting on season 2.",8
"It's quite good, actually. Even though there's something missing out from the plot or a little lack from the character. Like everyone said, it needs a little more improvement with the writing. Some of the story just off with the actual logic. The low class FBI agent who deal with a big case. But Gabriel Basso's acting cover up the script. Unlike the main female character, I feel no emotion, especially in the early episodes where she just had a terrible incident with her aunt & uncle on a fairly short time. But yeah, it's still worth to watch for keeping up your day on weekend. I quite enjoy it. Maybe if they gives us another season, I'm expecting some significant changes from the script and the acting.",9
"Think of every cliche in this genre and it's in here. Don't bother. Series like the British- Bodyguard are what shows like this should strive to be but fail miserably.From the very start of episode one you can literally predict not only what is going to happen next but also what the conversation is going to be.Awful writing, average acting and a low budget are recipe for disaster.The constant twists and and turns are so bad that it seems like the writers were just throwing things in to see how much they could get away with...
There are tons of series out there with better story lines and acting so don't waste your time.",5
"I saw the show sometime in March and honestly, I got to say it lacks depth and any shred of realism. Episode 1 started somewhat okay but by the time I got to the 4th, I just couldn't anymore. It felt like the show writers/directors were intentionally trying to gaslight us. It was vividly predictable from the 2nd episode (I mean literally too easy) for anyone with an ability to discern which is about everyone, I think. There was virtually zero cohesion between the casts, the lead actors had no chemistry whatsoever. The lead actress Rose was a constant pain in the ass everytime she was casted... stone-faced, cocky and ungrateful. Two of the most important people in her life were killed and she barely shows any emotion!! Apparently, she also seemed to be better at being an agent than he was, straying the plot further away from reality. The acting was bland and very cringy at too many moments. The Farr lady with the ugly overworn, silver wig could have been easily replaced with a robot. Zero emotions, too many needless F-bombs, even with her pale and emotionless character, I wasn't convinced she conveyed the role of an authoritative figure(I doubt that's her fault though). The assassin couple characters were totally unnecessary and out of place, one might think with the amount of screen time given to them, they were relevant to the show but they weren't. It was just a dumb and failed attempt at trying to keep the show lively. Plotholes here and there, all over. An absolute false reflection of how security agencies are run. All these aren't surprising though, what really surprises me is how people think this is a good show and the hype around it is just ridiculous. U want to watch and enjoy a good spy series, see The Bodyguard, Slow Horses and Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan. They aren't perfect but they are way better than this action-craving, amateurish and simplistic joke of a spy thriller. I'm starting to think 3 stars might even be too generous of a review.",3
"Intriguing story overall, but too unbelievable to engage. Chief of Staff looks to have too much time (based on West Wing),
What father tells her 8 yo daughter she's to blame for her sister dying- on the day the her funeral - and what 8 yo doesn't cry when hearing that.Who is calm enough to try to bond and conspire with/against a kidnapper that just shot your lover in front of you.What person is up for sex the day after seing their aunt hanged by murders trying to murder you too.If you're looking for a smart spy-series with clever political schemes and raid intriguing dialogue. This is not it.This is just a Netflix mass production from a cheap script.",6
"I think some negative people need to give their heads a wobble. Not an 'Oscar winner'? No... but I found it an enjoyable 'binger'. When you look around at some of the dross that wins best film these days? That nobody goes to see? The leads all gave perfectly adequate performances, enough 'F bombs' to make it realistic. It must be hard enough actually working in a place like the Whitehouse, but a room with no windows and just a clock aand phone? Rather bleak indeed. Like I said, I enjoyed it for what it is. A few hours away from the rat race where you root for the good guys. What's wrong with that?",6
"The story was entertaining in a 'don't think about it too hard' kinda way and the cliffhangers on each episode were masterfully done. Unlike many Netflix shows, the ending of the season was actually complete and satisfying which is a sad high note in today's television where shows like The Diplomat end abruptly with no resolution to nearly any of the dramatic threads.The downsides to this show are difficult for me to look past. The acting overall was terrible. There was almost no chemistry between the 2 leads and the romantic stuff was down right embarrassing. The Farr character was simply the worst and nearly all of her lines sound like it was being read off a sheet of paper. Nearly all the characters were shallow and none of them grew or developed in any way. They all were 1 trick ponies from start to finish.Overall, I would not say this watch was a waste of time but also not good enough where I have any lasting excitement for season 2.",7
"Let's start with the bad.... So many plot holes and a bit cheesy to be honest. The main character is a tad annoying and seems to know more than the FBI and other government agencies put together. The head of the FBI personally attends scenes best left to his agents and his interrogation tactics are to simply shout at people. How did he get this far up the ladder which such outstanding leadership skills?Looks good and some of the characters are likeable/watchable along with the action scenes etc.To be honest, I've no idea why Netflix cancelled the amazing Mindhunter but made this instead? It's a poor man's version.",5
"I don't understand the good reviews, truly. The acting is terrible, the dialogue is too rigid, the story is extremely predictable and not remotely realistic or believable. Are we just that desperate for something new to watch that we make excuses for terrible shows and acting? There are so many character stories crammed into this show and not a single one of them are interesting. There's ten episodes but yet the dialogue is rushed the entire show and don't get to any point in the story until the very end. It almost becomes comical how amateur-college-project-like they speak/act. Take my word for it and don't waste your time.",2
"The storyline is great. The intensity level isn't quite there though. It would be great if this level could be on par with ""Bourne"", ""Jack Ryan"" and ""Condor"". Not going to give in though. I believe this has the potential to become even greater.Eve Harlow's performance as a crazy psycho, loved it. In some scenes she even looks like a female version of Rami Malik, no offence Rami.It's great to see D. B. Woodside again. Would love to see his character continue into future seasons.It was a shame that Robert Patrick's character didn't last long. Again, another character that could have been utilised in future seasons.Can't wait to see more.",7
"Sutherland actor is good. Main actress is acceptable. Everyone else is bad.The writing is bad:
""Why would you serve this country when it hates you for being black?"" ""This is how patriots get it done!"" *Dirty hicks in DC attacking a woman*I stopped watching for a few weeks and it was so forgettable that I forgot everything about it, including how bad it was, and tried watching again. No thank you.If you don't want to think about the show at all and you don't mind the strange political inserts, then it could pass the time, but frankly I am not curious how this story ends and will not complete it.",4
"Picture this. I'm an FBI agent and I get a call from a woman trying to hide from bad people hunting her down in a house. I tell her to check if the bathroom door closes on the inside. Lo and behold, it does. I tell her to lock it from the inside but to close the door without going inside, so the bad guys will think she's in there, buying her time. What? Yeah, I know. Absolutely brilliant idea if it weren't such a huge stretch of imagination and coincidence. There are very few bathroom doors that do that, and for good reasons. You'd be locking yourself out and breaking down your bathroom door on plenty an occasion, especially if you have kids.Next, I'm in a car chase with the woman these unknown bad guys are after. I complain I can't see their number plates. On a lengthy bridge, a crash ensues. Loads of people are hurt, cars have crashed all over the place. The criminals are trapped there; luckily we get away. So what do I do? I drive to a friend's airbnb house. And don't call a team of cops. Don't send anyone to the bridge where a bunch of criminals (trying to kill me and the woman I'm protecting) are trapped. And where, by the way, people might be dying. What what?The woman I'm protecting refuses to tell me what the guy who tried to kill her looks like. She doesn't tell in case there's a rat who'll want her dead if she tells. What? A ""rat"" would actually have a lot more motivation to kill her while she DOESN'T tell, as once she's told, killing her would be useless, or at any rate a lot less useful than while she's still alive. But I - hotshot FBI guy - don't bother to enlighten her.Next, unstable spies pull guns with the intent to use it on cops for a speeding ticket pull-over... Er, what?That pretty much sums it up. Stupid good guys, stupid bad guys. I switched off hoping they'd end up killing each other all in one go during a shoot-out.",2
"You really need to suspend all belief when watching this show, being brain dead would be a bonus.It's certainly stretching things saying it's political or a thriller.Unfortunately none of the cast are convincing in the weakly written roles they inhabit however well they are delivering their lines.How this got the greenlight I don't know but then again the dross that is churned out for streamers these days at best this is mediocre.The security services being either so inept or corrupt is just a joke. The Vice President being involved in a plot to assassinate a reformed terrorist that would involve hundreds of American citizens alao dying on US soil is also utterly ridiculous.",3
"Everyone saying this is a ""fast-paced"" show only watched the first 2 episodes. These episodes are a great draw into the show, but it quickly devolves into nothing but dialogue for the meat of the story. Character development for unlikeable characters is very common. An absolutely glacial movement of the plot. You're given less than a breadcrumb of action or suspense per episode. And this is for the entire middle of the show! Characters are introduced that take multiple episodes to make any difference to the story. Dialogue upon more dialogue upon more dialogue. This show could've been much better if it were properly paced and he fluff was cut out. A badly paced show.",4
"The characters are cardboard cut-outs. They're stiff and wooden. The script is laughable. People talk like no one really talks. People act like people wouldn't act. There are no character arcs. There are no true motives to push storylines. By the last episode, nothing very much really happens to differentiate from the first episode. Everything could have happened in one or two episodes. It's boring. It's inconsistent. It's dumb. Every event happens for plot convenience. The good guys always have their plot armor. Some characters come and go for no reason with no development or arc, even though the episodes focus on them from time to time. By the end of the series, you wonder what the point of their character was. All that wasted time could have been used to further the main characters development. I found myself wanting to play on my phone or empty the dishwasher rather than watch this show. This is a sci-fi channel quality show at best. I gave it two stars only because one star reviews hold a special place for shows/movies that are bad on purpose and I can unplug my brain to revel in their stupidity. This show actually thought it was clever, which makes it that much worse.",2
"After first scrolling through some reviews here on IMDB I wasn't sure if this would be my type of series. After watching the first episode I was dedicated to watch the others and I finished the series in one week. Don't expect amazing special effects, the best accents or the best actors. But expect a good thriller series where every person could be part of a big plot. Due to a good combination of action, drama and dialogues this series keeps you glued to the screen. A plot that will change constantly and make you wonder who can still be trusted. A must watch if you like a combination of thriller, action and political drama.I hope there will be a season 2 and I can't wait to watch that one.",9
"I have been using IMDb since it's inception and have never written a review previously. Read the other bad reviews - there are plenty. I would just be repeating their criticisms. This series was as bad as everyone said, I guess. I'd have to watch all the episodes to be certain, but I certainly won't. I couldn't get beyond the first episode... I can only add that it was so bad in every possible way (except for the basic conceit, which was intriguing) that I started writing this review before the credits rolled on that first episode. To me the true mystery is the 7.5 average viewer rating. That usually means the series is pretty good. Not this time. Do not pick up the phone!",3
"I've got no idea how this piece of predictable garbage has managed to get 7plus ratings . Story is too lame, acting so unnatural and casting is the worse. No one seems to be connected with the plot itself.This show can easily be considered to be on the list of tbe most pathetic series of the year. There's nothing interesting and it just keeps on getting dragged unnecessarily.The most irritating thing is after 2 episodes, the main plot jist goes inside the drawer and all the irrelevant parts are taken out and that does nothing but to bore and frustrate. It would have been better if it were just made a movie.",4
"...the script! The actors, locations, action, pace, photography and direction were all acceptable. I would expect no less from a spy thriller, which is one of my favorite genres.So, if you're like me, you'll watch the whole thing, hoping it will get better or, at least, a little more believable. You know who you are, even if I can't exactly recommend the series to you.Kudos to the actors for being able to utter such trite dialog amid inexplicable plot twists and cringey dialog.I truly think the ensemble did the very best they could with what was given to them, but I imagined them shaking their heads - just like me - during their first read-through and thinking ""Seriously?""",4
"Most will laugh, but for me, I refuse to binge shows. Night Agent almost, ALMOST made me go against my own method of watching.With that being said, I would watch one episode a week and it wad the longest week ever. I couldn't wait to get to the next episode.Night Agent is filled with action, and great acting. Especially for names I didn't know. I was always a big 24 fan and this filled my emptiness that was Jack.Lots of plot twists and edge of your seat suspense. The last two episodes I had to practically remind myself to breath.Sure, there are parts that are a bit far fetched but guess what? This is Hollywood and not real life. I'm not going to go in detail about the show, just grab the remote, press play, and let your mind free. Great job Netflix with this one!",10
"The writing seems lazy and rushed. We do expect some bad guys to have poor aim but we are expected to ignore obvious blunders with reality.There was some real potential for this storyline to take you places, but it really seems that there was a lot left on the table There was some real potential for this storyline to take you places.If you need an example for me to prove my point. In episode three, the agent and his girl are parked on the side of the road and the bad guys just take a left when the agent was in plain sight.Are we supposedsed to believe that they wouldn't look right...This is from the creator of The Shield, absolutely no comparison. This is from the creator of the shield.",6
"This truely wonderful book was published in the 1980,s by Walter Tevis.The first episode was true to the book,it was not in any hurry.This seems a great adaptation of a classic,classic book.BETH HARMON is the LISBETH SALANDER of the chess board.I,M A WOMAN HEAR ME ROAR.",10
"An utterly engrossing tale that makes chess sexy, not words that normally exist in the same sentence.I'm on my 4th ep' and know I'll watch the lot today, with a rude interruption for a trip to the doctors, bummer. The rags to riches story is gathering pace, tragedy will almost certainly follow, but that's a guess. EDIT - Yes it did, sooner than I thought, and the decline into self medication almost ends the whole adventure. There's a review on here that questions the use of the early addiction story as pointless and even offensive. They obviously have no clue as to how childhood trauma shapes us for the rest of our lives. Add that to the fact that child care used drugs to subdue and control children in institutions up until the 60's and in some countries much later.There will almost certainly be negative reviews calling this 'PC nonsense'. Stuff 'em, history is full of brave and intelligent women, just ask Cleopatra or Marie Curie. Beth Harman is fearless and totally determined to do things her way. Her plan is simple, be the best by beating the very best.Anya Taylor-Joy is the perfect choice, a lot of shots are of players staring at each other, and her huge brown eyes are the star of the show and she uses them a thousand ways. Her adopted mother is the organiser and recognises the earning potential early on, even if she knows jack about chess, she certainly understands the dollar. What starts out as a money making scheme becomes quite a touching mother/daughter, even sister relationship but avoids un necessary sentiment. My assumption was that her adopted mother would be a barrier to Beth's aspirations, as all of the women she'd encountered since her dead biological mother with very sound life advice were. Yet she let Beth live the life of her choosing. There are plenty of examples in this series of women holding other women back, whether it's down to social convention or just the idea of 'not fitting in'. Without her would Beth have become Beth?Netflix have smashed it out of the park, again. The high production values and excellent casting, plus an adaption being praised as 'close to the book' makes this a must watch series for gals and guys alike. It's definitely one for snuggling up on a cold evening with your significant other.UPDATE - I've finished it, in one day as predicted. The finale is fantastic, I don't mind admitting that I cried, in a blokey, happy way.
UDATE OF THE FIRST UPDATE (because I watched it again) It was better, by a mile.",9
"The ""Queen's Gambit"" series is based on the 1983 novel by Walter Tevis.
This show doesn't disappoint from the book, in fact it is enthralling! Well directed and shot the story follows an orphan who develops an affinity for chess and prescription pills. Developed by Scott Frank and Allan Scott the show premiered October 23, 2020 on Netflix. Headlining a talented cast, Anya Taylor-Joy is incredible. Her performance exceeds expectations and her heartfelt moments are riveting.",10
"For this reading keep in mind I'm halfway through EP2 at this point. Also this kind of series is the type I adore to watch always.I'll reserve judgement until later but GOOD GOD who decided upon the production decision to make the ENTIRE first episode about ""a before the events of this series"" little girl episode?The entire series is supposed to be about Anya Taylor Joy as a chess player with mental issues. Yet rather than a carefully curated 10-15 minute explainer of how she was as a child.We get a full blown repetitive and extremely dry 1 hour episode of her being a pill popper as a child. This is the introduction that is supposed to keep viewers hooked?I'm stunned at the idiotic decision makers who thought that was a great way to introduce a fairly cerebral TV miniseries to the audience. I'll keep watching to see if it improves but the first episode is undeniable horse droppings.
How they thought the first EP would draw anybody in to want to watch more is beyond my understanding.",6
"This TV Mini-series is excellent! It is wonderful to see Anya Taylor-Joy in a well crafted show. She shines brilliantly as Beth Harmon a chess playing prodigy. The story takes us from when she is a small girl, orphaned, continuing through her teenage angst years. I highly recommend this show. Great cinematography and directing and of course to get back to the acting - its top notch! I only wish there was more than 7 episodes.",10
"More intense than a good thriller,more dramatic than a good drama....The power of Queen!!!!",10
"Top to bottom, scenic design, wardrobe, direction and casting, this is a top notch production. The acting is seamless and the characters embody their roles perfectly.One couldn't hope for a more original or more compelling story. As you might expect from the title, Chess plays a central role, and the author's use of the game as an extended metaphor shifts in ways both nuanced and explosive. For any thinking person, this series is sure to delight.In my opinion, strong characterization always provides the best entertainment. The producers of ""The Queen's Gambit"" tackle the tough task of creating a compelling story from the inner lives of the characters. Granted, they are working from an excellent novel, but oftentimes, attempts to bring works that center around the mental, rather than the physical journey of the central character fail miserably. In this case, the producers deserve the highest praise. If you like thoughtful stories that expose the inner lives of the characters, don't miss this one.The show, while generally acceptable for children, contains several adult themes, so parental guidance is recommended.",10
"The right Spanish title according to Netflix, it'sGAMBITO DE DAMAKind regards",3
After the first two episodes I cancelled my friday night plans to watch this series in one sitting.,10
"Such an inspiring story, god knows how much time they put in it, you can even see how she grows over time. I think this series will be an inspiration to many people who had difficult childhoods\addictions.",10
"I did not expect it to be this good. Really pleasant to watch. Great acting, music, story, cinematography. Would recommend.",10
"The color of the show is absolutely fantastic and the camera work is oustanding. Ofcourse, it wouldn't all be amazing if it wasn't for Anya Taylor Joy. Incredible actress, with such a way of capturing the scene.",10
"Wow, love this show and I've only seen the first episode. Reminds me of what I used to be like, not playing chess tho lololol....",10
"Chess is cerebral. This series is not.Scott Frank has made films from Logan to Wolverine. This one is somewhere in the middle. The direction and writing is clichéd to the point you can guess their dialogues.It juggles too many ideas; genius to madness, woman in male dominated field, orphan dealing with past. But everything is mismanaged. Also what's up with like 4 montages in every episode. THAT'S SO LAZY.Anya Taylor Joy is the only saving grace. Her and the production design make the show watchable. Also the chess moves and techniques are pretty accurate that's kinda cool.",7
"I didn't think I'd find a show about chess players this enthralling, but I did. The storyline was beautifully written, so raw and even suspenseful. Anya delivers a beautiful performance, I have a soft spot for characters such as the one of Beth Harmon: brooding, keen, admired, yet terribly flawed, struggling mentally, and unpredictable (Like Annalise Keating from HTGAWM). I liked that it didn't turn out to be overly romantic, as I had been expecting. Although one could argue, historically speaking, that a woman competing in a very male-dominated sport during those times would have had wayy more obstacles thrown her way from the men's side, it did warm my heart to see so many of her male opponents adore, admire and support her wholeheartedly. Beautifully empowering without being a gigantic political statement (saying this as an avid feminist.) Definitely worth the watch, also the camera work is very pleasing to the eye as welm as the color palette, loved the aesthetic!!",10
"I just watched the first 5 episodes straight, and it is perfection. There's just something about it, it's well acted, scripted and shot. It has the same vibes as the movie ""A Single man"", which too was stunning.",10
"3 episodes in and I still haven't been told anything about chess, what makes her a strong player and so on, I had hopes as the show started by naming the openings and I felt maybe ideas of the game would be mentioned and also impact the plot, we get nothing only name droping chess lingo to make her seem good at chess, it also doesn't help that they couldn't be bothered to get the position of the opening that the title is named after(it gets mentioned in episode 1),her rise is also too fast and i can somehow excuse this as it being fiction and all but it just seems too ludicrous, within months of playing beth can beat a chess coach (which should be nearly impossible as she has only learnt a portion of the game namely the opening, she hasn't learnt the middle or endgame which already is a very big skill difference )
then we get to the chess tournament stage, I can excuse the first tournament even though it felt very lackluster and downright impossible,
the second tournament threw me off more, she is to play a 2 hour game without prior experience or even an inkling of preparation for something so mentally demanding and she does so quickly and easily against a top player I just can't bring myself to believe it and this has nothing to do with her gender no human can do that.
in short we haven't learnt anything about her chess how her personality affects her playstyle or anything on chess in general it is a sport show about an athlete without us knowing anything about what approach said athlete takes in conquering the sport, a lot of unexplored aspects of the game were missed.aside the chess it is a good show i guess but I feel at the very least the ideas and principles of chess should have been mentioned and the matches given more care.",5
"A truly remarkable show with a splendid cast who played each of their roles marvelously. Chess players will surely enjoy all of the amazing factual (also fictitious and sometimes way over the top ) chess jargons and lines that are thrown about, but non chess players will enjoy it alike.Best scene? The one where Beth visits the orphanage basement after news of the janitor's death and finds her picture with him along with all of her news clippings that he had carefully curated together. That scene had me in tears.This series outdid 'The Pawn Sacrifice' by a mile and a fictional story of a female Bobby Fischer was better told than the real one.",9
This kept me on edge ! Very cool !Very cool !Very cool !,10
"You should definitely watch this incredible show. Yes, it's Netflix(it's just almost all shows here are same), but not like his other shows, so different and so good in his on way. Anya Taylor-Joy - amazing and talented actress. Go on, watch it.",10
An incredible series. An absolute joy to watch and a complete surprise. Anya Taylor-Joy was wonderful. I honestly have never heard of her and she was absolutely perfect for the role. I would have loved to see it last so much longer.,10
"I was very hesitant at first. The first episode could easily have been boiled down to 20 minutes; or spread out throughout the series. It's like most prequels: stale, and quite unnecessary.Episode 2 is where the suspense starts to form. Stellar performances from both Anja Taylor-Joy and Marielle Heller. Their dynamic is what keeps the middle game interesting. However, I would like to see more of how the death of her alcoholic step-mother affects Beth towards the end game. The tension keeps you going, but the emotion is not (quite) there. You could say Elisabeth's addictions are what keeps her closed off; but frankly, that's just lazy (or rushed) writing. I would've liked to see the end and the beginning more closely tied together throughout the series; rather than just a last minute circle compositional construction.From where Anja takes the rains from her rather lacking child predecessor, the stress is palpable. Moving pieces of white and black could only be so interesting if you're actually interested in the game in the first place. From easy tactile moves, to gradually advanced difficulty: makes you feel the drive and the intellectual growth of the protagonist.The experience, all in all; is more rewarding than the end itself, as it doesn't leave you feeling brain-dead. Playing chess is exciting, stimulating - thrilling. The series captures that unremittingly.Side note: I would've liked to see more exploration of Beth's sexuality. Since it's quite considerable, as it is a seemingly important part of the first scene.
As Alma (stepmother) says: ""I think you just don't like Manuel."" (men well)",7
"A brand new series that is a period history that takes place in the late sixties. The beginning shows her parents dead in a car crash she walks away from. Thrown into an orphanage at the age of nine, she acquired an uncanny taste for chess (which I love) and the green tranquilizers they gave the children in those backwards southern town then. (A century earlier it was morphine and opioIdes). It is surely a dark comedy like the new nurse Rached that popularised Netflix recently also! I think you'll like this new series as much as I. Truly depraved enjoyment! Pax, Murf",10
"Excellent cinematography.
Excellent acting.
Excellent script.
Excellent sound design.
Excellent editing.A+",10
I don't have much to say But wow this show is probably one of my favorite so far in my life i love it and i love playing chess too.,10
... u-need not-know much-all bout-chess... this-mini-series is wonderful... Taylor-Joy is-a-star,10
"Many years ago I was an excellent chess player. Then one day I realized no matter how much I concentrated on games, and I could anticipate several moves ahead......Basically I sucked.I can't help but draw parallels to Bobby Fischer, but I believe the protagonist of this series, Beth Harmon, would eventually have a much happier life than Fischer.The actress, Anya Taylor-Joy, is destined for great things. Her portrayal of the shy damaged girl was fantastic. Anya Taylor-Joy took Beth from a shy ugly duckling to an exquisite, but naive beauty, who is totally unaware of her smoldering sexuality.I reviewed this series as ten stars not because I used to play chess, but on account of a original story, well acted by all involved.I recommend this series very highly and if you like episode one, you'll be hooked.",10
"It's not only a good series, it's not only the wonderful story, acting, cinematography, music. You watch it and it feels like the movie itself is a chessgame. With a rather weak opening indeed, a fabulous middlegame and a perfect ending. It's the kind of movies/series that stucks you in your armchair, on your couch or even in your bed anyway, forgetting about eating, sleeping, living. After the end, the return to reality has not yet occurred. You are still tormented in dimly lit orphanages, you travel all over the world, you are welcomed in super-bright chess tournaments a little more arrogant and well-dressed and you analyze variants. Do not miss it!",9
"I don't know the first thing about chess, but this had me captivated from the first episode. Some reviews are blasting it because it had too much chess? Others say they didn't like the back story? Makes zero sense, the story is about a chess prodigy, and her back story ties to every part of her life and how those events unfolded. The casting was superb, directing was phenomenal, I could go on. My only complaint was not closing out a few story lines but I also they were minor and didn't affect the outcome of the story itself. I rarely write reviews but had to for this one! It sucks you in and leaves you satisfied, by way of wanting more but only because it's that good, not because the ending was bad. When awards season comes, this better be a winner, lots of garbage and bad acting/writing lately, this is by far a winner!!",10
Beautifully filmed. The phrase binge worthy was created for shows like this. I've never played chess in my entire life but I could not stop watching this series. A must watch for anyone who appreciates talent and genius. I didn't have to think about the 10 stars I gave it because it absolutely deserves everyone.,10
"For a fiction story it is very boring, we don't need to see endless games with predictable outcome.
I had to fast forward after episode 3 as I couldn't take watching one more game.
Do not recommend. I don;t understand the high rating.",2
Very basic script and a one dimensional arrogant teen whose good at chess is basically the whole story. Very disappointing. It's beautiful to watch but that's about it.,3
"I got excited to see female chess players represented in pop culture, but my expectations were not met unfortunately. It's a visually beautiful yet cheesy drama series, and that's all to it really. It could have been about ice skating and it would not have changed the show or the story line. The serie implies professional chess players are good looking rock stars who take an average of three seconds to make a move in a tournament. If you have even been to a chess tournament, as a player or spectator, this is not the show for you.",6
"Watching ""The Queen's Gambit"" was the best viewing experience I've had in 2020.
Intriguing characters and a great story were accompanied by memorable visuals. The camera enjoyed zooming in on Anya Taylor-Joy's unique face. Her stunning closeups with her huge eyes conjured up images of a beautiful Area 51 alien. A Netflix promo showed one of her closeups for less than 5 seconds, and it immediately caught my interest. This series was much more than visuals. It was a wonderful story of friendship, even though for much of the series it can seem like a story about isolation and self abuse.The filmmakers made chess seem like the most exciting game in the world! I never thought I would enjoy watching other people play, but the filmmakers were very successful.Young ""Beth Harmon"" was played by Isla Johnston. I applaud her casting and her performance. She was very believable as the young Anya Taylor-Joy. She was the central focus of the early episodes growing up in an orphanage. I think we will see many more films with Isla Johnston as she grows up.Some of the series takes place in Russia. Netflix did a great job in Chernobyl of giving us an appreciation for the Russian people. I also loved their treatment of the Russian people in The Queen's Gambit. It was amazing to see how chess to the Russians was like baseball to Americans.I really don't have anything critical to say about this series. I was immediately taken over by the story. The visuals helped keep me intrigued, and I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen to Beth Harmon. I was with her every minute of this approx 7 hour series. I cried and cheered. If you are stuck at home or even if you're not stuck at home, I highly recommend this series.",10
Maybe the best Netflix series. This series is a must view.Fantastic.,10
"Excellent cast, storyline, cinematograpy, acting and music. Simply one of the best series I have seen. Feels like The imitation game, Genius (Einstein), The Theory of Everything and The man who knew infinity combined.",10
"This was a series that surprised and amazed. Who knew chess could be so mesmerizing? ATJ does a wonderful acting job here, understated, heartbreaking, triumphant. Don't miss this series because you don't know a thing about chess. This is about life. Beth's life, her struggles, her discovery of chess, her friendship, her losses, her wins. See it.",10
"What a show honestly. I usually never post reviews but this one just felt special. I've had this show on my reminder list since I read the synopsis a week ago. I thought it was going to be a decent fun watch, but boy was I in for a ride. From the directing, the cinematography, the SCORE (this alone deserves a 10/10), and the acting is phenomenal. Anya Taylor-Joy beautifully showcased her acting and honestly made you experience her character's journey from start to end. To sum it all up, this show is keeps you at the edge of your seat, it is a thrilling rollercoaster while somehow still maintaining to be an emotional tear-jerker. Please do yourself a favour and watch this masterpiece.",10
"Watched it all in one night.
I didn't think a story about chess would keep me interested. But this one got me deeply invested.
Because this is not just about the game of chess, it's so much more.Ultimately, what I cared about wasn't just the game anymore, it was the person. I was rooting for her. I really cared what would happen to her and that's probably the most essential thing for me when watching any tv series.What made me attached to this character was how I saw her grow up from a little orphan girl, witnessing her from the first chess game all the way to the end and everything in between.
I was enthralled, inspired, moved, proud.
Had me in tears too.
Excellent cast, story, cinematography, writing, everything.
Thank you for this. Thank you.",10
"After Netflix cancelled one of my favorite shows, I was close to canceling my subscription. This miniseries changed my mind. This is one of the favorite things I have seen onscreen in a long while. Everything about this show was perfect for me, including the fact that it has a beginning, middle and end. Anya Taylor-Joy is amazing. I would watch her in anything. If this doesn't win awards, I don't even know anymore.",10
"This is not the typical type of show that I would usually watch but I'm so glad I did. It's so unique and different that it's difficult to put into words. If you're thinking of watching this show, just do it, you won't be disappointed.",10
"Perfect, I saw all the episodes in one day. I did not expect it to be this good. Really pleasant to watch. Great acting, music, etc.
I have only one word: Excellent.",10
"I wasn't expecting much from this but I loved it straight off the bat.I really thought this was a true story such was the strength of the characters.Anya Taylor Joy is superb in the lead and she keeps you glued to the screen all the way through.You will not regret watching this.
It's one of the best I've seen in a while",10
"It's really good! One of the best series I have ever seen - on all levels of production: great cast all the way around, beautiful cinematography, wardrobe, music score and an engaging and addictive script!",10
"And was very surprised. The preview was kind of blah and didn't drive me to watch this at all, only because of Anya did I turn it on and wow. All the actors, the costume and set design, the story, the pace of the story, everything was executed extremely well.The few bad reviews on here, I'd just like to know what these people consider good? If you're looking for a movie about the fundamentals of chess and how to play it watch a damned documentary, not a drama. If you think this was boring, maybe you should stick to action movies. Some critics on here judge movies for things they are not and were never meant to be and that's just dumb and childish. If you can't tell what you're getting into before watching something you have no valid opinion on the subject.",10
"I never really liked drama movie/series; I'm more of an action-movie guy. When I saw the title of this movie I must say I was captivated by the movie description and the beauty of this actress. So, I decided to watch it.
From episode 1, I was captivated by this series. No matter how many times my work, friends & family, interrupted me while watching the series, I kept coming back to it. It was WORTH IT!. This movies shows Talent, Grace &, above all, gave me Hope.
I'll say no more. Watch it, you won't regret it.",10
"Great mini-series on Netflix. Great acting and excellent cinematography. The only downside is missing her background in the first episodes.
The rest of the series is amazing, it has pressure and a great idea.",8
"I loved it! The acting of Anya was great, the colours, the quality of filming, everything. I enjoyed every moment of it. I am happy to see Thomas Sangster playing in another miniseries.",10
"Binged the entire series, excellent, story, setting, colour , drama , suspense.
I'm disappointed it's finished, nice touch and finish to the story. Enjoyed every tick tock, tick tock minute!
Well done Netflix and great performance from Anna-Taylor Joy! She nailed it... Checkmate!!!",9
"Put down all other genres for this limited series. Spot on! No drama, no soap opera, just well written and respectful portrayal of a woman in a man's world, rising from nothing and how brilliance leads to success. Can hardly wait to see how it ends. Oh and if you weren't fascinated with chess before, it may be time to set up the board. Well done Netflix. It's been a while.",10
"The queen's gambit is a very strong and smart written TV show and one of the best TV shows on netflix this year
Chess games shows and movies need a very smart writting to success and to connect drama with the game world...
And this show did it very good.",9
"I have no words to descrive the intelligence of this title. This is a drama, a thriller, a slice of life... All around the story of this chess master has a sense. You'll be identified with your fears, shame, and regrets. Don't miss this show. I used to hate the lead role actress, now I love her. Great, really great job!PS: Two days later... i feel so good to remind this thing that is in my head. This fact made me chage my 9 to a 10. At these strage days, thank you for bring us things like this. Chapeau!",10
"As I write this, the goose pimples have yet to recede; the tear in my eye has yet to dry. Overcoming the travesties of life, Queen's Gambit celebrates reaching excellence, as a film well done, and as Harmon achieves excellence, personally and professionally. Well done.Anya Taylor-Joy was not only subtlely superb, her surrounding cast showed the magnificent progress we humans can make, when we reach in and help out. A triumph of the human spirit.I found the ambiance of the mid-sixties profoundly well orchestrated. The costumer, Gabriele Binder, deserves big trophies.The conclusion where Beth finds ""Scheibel"" again touched my heart, head, and hearth. Thank you Tevis and Frank!",10
"I rarely give 10 stars, it's one of the best things I've watched in a long time. It's beautifully written and acted, the lead was wonderful. The only thing I'm sad about is I know I won't watch something as brilliant as this for a while.",10
"The details of this show are brilliant. Even the lighting changes and slight narrowing of focus between the movie's current and flashback timelines that slowly unveil the making and, at times, unmaking of a brilliant mind worked seamlessly to orient the film and the main character, Beth, within the winding storyline.It's a marvel that somehow nothing in this film is flashy or explosive, but it is still imbued with edge-of-your-seat drama - and all over a series of chess games. I hadn't the slightest idea how they were going to make a chess story engaging, but there it was: all of the intensity of a boxing match fit into a wordless exchange over a monochromatic board game.Needless to say, I was thoroughly impressed. The actors were subtle, sometimes unnervingly unreadable, leaving one with the very distinct impression of having been a part of a conversation in which no one ever over-explained anything to you, like a traditional production might. No one ever tapped you on the shoulder and whispered in your ear ""I smirked, because I am indulging you,"" or ""I laughed, because I enjoyed your joke,"" but the interactions in this show left you with a sense that the characters were more human, claiming a sensation of more nuanced ambiguity or uncertainty in each exchange. Perhaps more than that, perhaps bequeathing a strange sense of autonomy to Beth and the men of that world as they rarely smiled and often remained veiled as they interacted and internalised the action around them.The costumes were art.The only real fault I saw in this show is how each episode seemed to expend a character, only inserting them when Beth had a need of them and disposing of them by the time the plot of that episode had concluded. A veritable rolodex of parental figures, friends, and lovers only existing to be sampled, tried on, and put away wet. I'm sure this decision was to reinforce the idea that Beth is the central character of her own story and chess was her only constant companion, but the expendability of characters that evolved around her felt callous and unrealistic.Anya Taylor-Joy's performance was excellent - nearly flawless, though, in the first few episodes, her playing a 15-year-old, pretending to be a 13-year-old seemed to lean a little heavily into the absurd.Finally, while what really drew me to this show was the presence of Thomas Brodie-Sangster', and his perennial ability to sew a distracting level of endearing, cerebral charm into every character I have had the pleasure of watching him play, his costume choices were never contextualised, which made him seen more like a British man dressing up as a ""Florida man"" for Halloween than a sort of quirky chess player. Generally, I also found the show under-utilised him, shifting him too harshly from role to role as he, in rapid succession, seemed to change into a completely different character in each of the four episodes he was in.In conclusion, I would highly recommend this television show.",9
Was pleasantly surprised by what a great story this was. Highly recommend this to anyone.,10
This series was outstanding. Phenomenal story and acting. It keeps the viewer interested throughout the entire series. The story does not become cliche or lose steam at any time. Anya Taylor-Joy plays the role of Beth Harmon to perfection. I highly recommend this series. It's been quite a long time since I've watched such an excellent series.,10
That what it was and I loved it. I wish we had such unique well made shows.,10
"One of the best new shows of this year, amazing performance by a goddess Taylor-JoyShe truly deserves an award",10
Amazing underdog story. Kept me interested throughout. I truly appreciated how the head matron at the orphanage and her adopted mom were nuanced characters not just your typical caricature of mean or uncaring.Worth the trip.,10
"I wasn't sure what to expect from a show based around a game I've played maybe 3 or 4 times in my life... but this was all so well-done and kept me on the edge of my seat! Everything was thoughtful and deliberate. It grabbed my attention in episode one and didn't let go until the end. In addition to incredibly detailed sets and cinematography, the acting was truly top notch. It's a multifaceted treasure that outshines most of the series being released these days.If you're feeling skeptical, just watch one episode. It's sure to please.",10
"One of, maybe best series I have ever seen!
Not much of a pro reviewer, but I do know when I see greatness.
This series is a must watch, especially for anyone who has played chess.BRAVOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!",10
"Open a beer or two, and make sure you watch this one in one sitting. It deserves to be eaten in one sitting. Outstanding!",10
"Best Netflix show i watched in so long i cant even remember last time i was this impressed. This was magnificent tv, thank you",10
"Just excellent on every level. Dynamic characters with brilliant acting, great time-piece imagery, fast and appropriate pacing, I couldn't stop watching from start to finish. Explores the pressures of success and how it can lead to alcohol/substance absuse and the strength it takes to rise back from it. You don't have to be any sort of avid chess fan to enjoy this, I can't recommend it enough.",10
"Another winner by Netflix, one of the very best Series I have seen this Year. It starts off a bit slow since the main Character doesn't really do a lot of Dialogue.Instead, much of the Story is told thru Visual Cues, like the expression of their Faces, what is happening around them, or thru the Dialogue of the other Characters, so it does need some bit of getting used to.But once you get the hang of it, the Story just flies and flies and flies. Anya Taylor Joy as Beth Harmon was magnificent, but Isla Johnston was equally magnificent, if not more so as she totally owned the first Episode as the young Beth.I know how to play Chess, but am not a big Fan of it, and I thought that the Creators of the Series did a fantastic Job of making the Game understandable enough to be appreciated by anyone who doesn't know about it.The Series is mainly about Chess, but it is also much more than that, it is a Coming of Age Story, a Thriller, it tackled Alcohol and Medication Addiction, Relationships, etc.Director Scott Frank's last collaboration with Netflix, the Western themed Limited Series ""Godless"" released in 2017 was also a Masterpiece, and now I am a big Fan of his, I am looking forward to his next Series.A Must-See, as I mentioned before, one of the best Series of 2020.",10
"This miniseries is excellent. Everything is perfect, The performance, the script, the score, the soundtrack, the visuals and the shots. I never thought a story about chess would keep me so interested. But, this one got me so invested. The character is so well developed, so much connection that I started rooting for in an instant. Anya is so graceful, so well mannered and so focused in her game. Truly fantastic. The production design is so well and her costumes are so great, stylish yet so classy.Incredibly talented Anya shines her way from the start to finish. This series actually had me captivated from the start. An excellent drama, MASTERPIECE!
Really glad I watched this show. Actually, binged it. Totally worth it.",10
"This show was outstanding from start to finish. The acting was superb, the cast was perfect, the story was interesting, the wardrobes were on point, and the director did a terrific job. I highly recommend you watch this T.V. show.",10
You must watch this mini serie. Anya Taylor is great actress. In my view this serie is greatest serie/movie about chess. Final scene was emotional...,10
"When you've seen everything on Netflix, a you will watch any new show they throw at you. I did not have high expectations. But I was so wrong. So wonderfully and totally wrong.
We watched Queen's Gambit, all seven hours of it, in a single sitting. This show is an absolute gem. Remarkable acting by Anya Taylor-Joy who will be a force to be reckoned with, her child counterpart- an absolute marvel. The series is smart, it's inspiring at times, it's sad and heartbreaking at times. Who knew watching game-plays of simulated chess can make your heart pound out of your ears? Truly, a story of determination, friendship, self discovery, struggle and triumph. I don't know about you, but my ceiling will be covered in chess pieces tonight.",10
"One of the easier 10s I've given out lately. I just rushed through this show in one sitting. It's gripping, it's interesting, it has a message and is never dull.I'm a sucker for sports and competition shows, so that helped aswell. Anya Taylor-Joy did a fantastic job as the fictional ""Elisabeth Harmon"".Not much else to say, just watch it, you won't be disappointed!",10
"We have been waiting since the great 1993 film ""Searching for Bobby Fischer"" for another good chess movie. The wait is over baby!!
Netflix has released the seven-part limited series called ""The Queen's Gambit"" This amazing series details the life of a nine-year-old orphan girl who learns how to play chess and then takes on the male dominated chess world.
A fun and exciting movie watching this little girl grow up into a beautiful woman. We watch as she experiences life while trying to master the game of chess.
Don't miss this great series! (Just finished binge watching the whole series and it is 4:30 am, I couldnt stop watching!)P.S. I want to be clear the series is incredible and I loved it but, if I had to deduct maybe a half a star it would be the many flashbackack scenes during the series. Helpful but a little excessive to me.",10
"Great story, great series. Engages, entrances, beguiles, romances...Some people mentioned the lead character and her development, but so many of the supporting characters were great too. Just really, really good television.",9
"I was trying to think of any flaws...I couldn't.
Just a great series and you should not miss it.The only reason i could see you would not like it, because its not your genre type.Great acting, great styling and cinematography. Great writing casting. Pretty much perfect.I particularly loved the originality. When did you see a drama series focusing on chess the last time?Exactly! It was refreshing.The only little thing that irked me were the very few times they had to use CGI fir the historical context. Ut was ok, but not great.",9
"I played chess (a bit) as a teenager although I was not very good at it. That was a long time ago and if you'd asked me yesterday I would have told you I wouldn't be interested in watching anything about a chess prodigy and her battles with drink and drugs.However I spotted this on Netflix last night and I thought I'd give it a go, pretty much because there was nothing else on that I fancied watching. I finally went to bed after watching the first 5 episodes and would have stayed for the last 2 if I wasn't too tired to give them my full attention.The story starts with an 8 year old girl being orphaned then sent to a home where the janitor ends up teaching her to play chess, realising that she is a natural at the game. At the age of 13 she is adopted by a dysfunctional couple and finds out that you can make money by playing (and winning) chess tournaments. Cue her rise to fame accompanied by her addiction to drink and pills. Along the way she acquires a group of friends (although she doesn't always realise that they are).I've seen the final 2 episodes now and can't recommend this enough. The acting is excellent and the story zips along, keeping you engaged with the main character's successes and disappointments along the way. It did take me till the last episode though to figure out where I'd seen her friend Harry before - he played Dudley Dursley in the Harry Potter films, although he's a much nicer character in this.I was a bit cheesed off with Netflix this week after the dreadful Rebecca adaptation but they have redeemed themselves with this. I haven't read the book of The Queen's Gambit so can't compare them but I will say the series is fabulous.",10
"This show has everything i wanted
complex female character , accurate depiction of chess , good acting , compelling story . Watched it all in one night and i am hungry for more",10
"Very compelling. I loved to storyline, wardrobes and the MUSIC. I also loved all the symbolism in the show. Starting with the title, ""The Queen's Gambit"" is a chess move where you sacrifice the queen to win. Beth sacrifices her relationships with everyone around her just to become victorious. In the orphanage, Beth's one identity her mom makes her (the jacket) ""so you know who you are"" is tossed away, and in turn giving her no identity. Her mother's last words ""close your eyes"" I believe spark her into a rebellion to keep her eyes open. We see this all throughout the series from staring at opponents to looking at her ceiling at night. The janitor that mends things around the orphanage, mends her but helping her get her identity back with chess. When they referred to white going first in chess, her friend says ""white always wins"" was a nod to racism in the 60s. Even the watch her foster mom gave her represented that she was on the right path, but broke when she spiraled down.Great show. Just give it 5 minutes of your time and you'll be hooked.",9
"There's a natural instinct to hesitate before giving any movie, any show 10 out of 10 stars - aren't I being hyperbolic? Does it really have no weaknesses? Does it really deserve a perfect score?
Having thought through all of that, the answer is ""yes"".
From the story, cinematography and editing, to the acting, down to the score and soundtrack - this is a show that perfectly follows the line between heavy and entertaining, realistic and exciting, gritty and hopeful.
Couldn't recommend it enough.
P.S. I'd never even dreamed that I could find chess in any way exciting, let alone this much.",10
One of the best from Netflix. There is really nothing bad to say about this. The acting is amazing. The camera work is truly great. The story itself was spellbinding. You don't even have to know chess to enjoy this. I wasn't sure if I was going to like this or not. Now I'm sure. Bravo Netflix.To the person who said taking illegal drugs makes you a better chess player: You completely missed the point. She was a genius level chess master but it wasn't until after she stopped drinking and taking drugs that she was able to reach her full potential.,9
"Old man, doesn't play chess, binged the series.
'Nuff said",10
"Haven't seen anything like that in a long time. Amazing acting, characters, the soundtrack deserves a 10 on it's own. Don't listen to me, GO WATCH!",10
"After binge-watching ""The Queen's Gambit"" in one sitting after its release, I was mesmerized by the acting, the directing, the symbolism and the sheer beauty and details of the story itself.
""The Queen's Gambit"" is a story about an orphan's life to adulthood in the flow of chess game; the story truly has a clear opening, midgame and endgame. What really matters in the story is our main character's, Beth's, decisions and growth in character throughout the series. With the help of extremely detailed character-building situations and dramatic misfortunes, we see the story of a character which we all could learn something from.""The Queen's Gambit"" tries to tell the viewer a simple but an important message: both life and chess are complicated and hard to learn, but with right preparations and mindset you can correct even your worst mistakes and overcome even the hardest of situations. You are the master of your own life.In conclusion - This series is something you will want to see, were you a chess player or not. There is something for every viewer to take away from this beautiful story about life and growing up.""Let's play.""",10
"The cast that assembled was second to none, with most charterers actually having meaningful scenes and one or two stealing a scene here or there which is a credit to the script and direction.Taylor-Joy is exceptional, and Marielle Heller unrecognizable as her mother, a truly stunning performance. Special shoutout to Harry Melling and Brodie-Sangster who helped glue the storyline together, but at the end of the day Taylor-Joy nailed this series (film) and should be awarded at some point for this stella performance.",10
"Too many montages, too many threads the show has trouble following. I get the angle of the young girl learning to become an adult despite all the odds, but you end up with issues forgotten between episodes, etc.
But it's quite good for a Netflix show, some strong moments and tension that you can enjoy.",7
"Wonderfully written, wonderfully acted. Treat yourself to this gem.",10
Really enjoyed this series. One reviewer gave a low rating mentioning how the first episode showed her using pills in the orphanage....yes they had to as it shapes the rest of her future. The characters are great and the acting on is superb. Kept me hooked!,10
"There are losers in this story - several of them women. However, they were the victims of overwhelming odds being stacked against them. In setting the substantive parts of this story in the late 60s we witness the times a changin' and that talent and will power can enable female success. We are never overly spoon fed as a viewer and there is enough narrative tension and intrigue to keep us engaged. A brilliant production with great script, acting, effects, sets, and costume. Especially love the pom pom hat and outfit alluding to the chess piece queen of the title.",10
"From orphan, curious child, to chess prodigy this movie chronicles the life of a beautiful and isolated cold to stunning woman!! I LIVE THIS!! I wish there was more!!",10
"I don't think I've ever been that engaged watching something that moves so slowly. I'm not sure what it is exactly, it's hard to put a finger on what makes this so captivating, but all aspects of the show were exceptional. Great acting, writing, plot development. Just a truly great work of storytelling. Highly recommend.",10
It is an incredibly captivating show. I never imagined that a story that I came across on Netflix by chance immediately trapped me for a whole weekend,10
I gave this show a shot on Netflix and was pleasantly surprised! Hands down the best mini series I've seen all year and potentially a story that will linger with viewers after. Once you hit the 2nd episode the series really picked up steam and I found myself binge watching until completion. Don't miss this show!,10
"Almost every day im checking on imdb on new movie & series releases to find something that might capture my mind and feelings. And then this...A story about an orphan girl, abondened, full of anger and without self-esteem.Living to herself aimlessly in an orphanage with strict rules. The only freedom she can find lies between her thoughts & imaginations. She discovers chess and puts the board to the center of her mind.That orphan against the world motif is not very new. But how this story is told leaves you stunned. What intrigued me the most was how beautiful the scenes are staged, when she dives into the depth of her mind. How these scenes are designed to emphasise with Beth getting lost in variations of chess strategies is incredibly engaging.
I guess most people imagine chess players rather as nerds who are socially shaken off and therefore escaping to a board game. The series showcases very well that chess is more to those who play it. They marvel at the beauty of the game.As a chess player myself im happy to have finally watched a show subject to chess, in which the players are not making ridiculous moves or which is just super boring. The affinity of highly talented players to drugs and the different types of chess players are also authentically reflected. Believe me, at every chess tournament you have a pair of chess playing twins and minimum one guy who dresses like a cowboy - and one Russian of course ??",10
"Best show 2020. great actors, great storyline. thx netflix :-)",10
"Just when I thought I had run out of things to watch, I stumbled upon this absolute gem. This was perfection, and it appears many other reviewer's agree with me. I just wish they were more shows like this, it was just absolutely fantastic.",10
"My only criticism is the very beginning in the orphanage and Beths first encounter with chess seemed quite far fetched considering she had zero knowledge of the game Trang's or not.
That aside the production settings story acting is First Class and addictive.to watchI also played chess when in my junior school age 7 and have always loved the game nothing near the standard of this story however this show will not only win awards but I truly believe it will revive an interest in the great gameHighly recommend",10
I was immediately emotionally invested. Superb character development and so well edited. The score was just beautiful. Even though I don't know all the rules in chess this was still very captivating and way more exciting than thought it would be. I highly recommend it to anyone who prefers quality over quantity.,10
"Story is 10/10, Actors 10/10, the soundtrack and the way story is laid out captivates you to watch it in one whole sitting.And for our Precious Anya. Oh my godness. it was pure joy to watch her act it all out. I can tell. She is going places. This role is played to perfection and can only open up more challenging roles for her. - Wich she well deserves. Everyone else in the movie played their roles splendidly too! afterall a great tv show takes a whole team to pull it together. :)Never written a review before, so be gentle with me guys. :)",10
"I have so many words I could say...on the other hand this piece of television perhaps is best described by two 'Absolutely brilliant'. Thank you to 'everyone' involved in this production - TV/Film/Drama at its very, very BEST!!!!",10
"I binged watch it and great storyline! Love how I related to the show in a sense with the ups and downs of life in general. We all go through tough times and having to listen to others but not doing them, is the best!",10
"I do play chess, however very badly. My husband was actually rated at one time and kept beating me! This movie was FANTASTIC! It captured so much from the very beginning to the emotionally charged ending. Although chess was it's main focus it certainly wasn't its only focus. Such a STRONG cast, brilliant writing, directing, everything about it was, in a word PERFECT!",10
"What a great show?
Nice works , great acts and very interesting.",10
"Agree with most of the high-rating reviews here. This is how a movie/series should be done, congratulations to all crew ! Glad there are still intellingent and talented people to do this, which - sadly - is less and less often in our time.",9
The Queen's Gambit holy mamma Mia I love it I love it!!! Best mini series I watched it in 7 hours direct,10
"Amazing story, great acting, delicious execution. You will love it.",10
"Just wow....was falling out of love with netflix after a weak run of shows but this is so good.....amazing acting, beautifully shot and intelligent and sensitive storytelling!!!!! More like this please netflix",10
I don't normally review shows but this one was fantastic! I watched the entire series in less then 24 hours and would watch it again in a heartbeat. Every episode is good. It stays strong the entire series and captivates you. I would not be surprised if this show wins tons of awards. 10/10 would recommend.,10
"All it takes is just one role, one script to turn things around for your movie career. Anya was made for this role and she did an excellent job. I was lost in the story, practically binged it in a day. Beautiful done i wish i could give it more than a 10. Well done to the whole crew that put this together. A must watch, don't be shy give it a go. I smell some awards for this.",10
"This is a brilliant mini-series centring on the themes of addiction, loss, and friendship. Anya Taylor-Joy is absolutely brilliant, the writing is well done, and the supporting cast is wonderful. It dodges cliches successfully while telling a very charming, funny, and sad story. One of the best things I have watched this year.",9
"Not the kind of show I usually watch, but I watched the entire series in one sitting. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen!",10
"The Queen's Gambit was a random find for me. I started watching it without any expectations but the first episode was just enough to keep me interested. As I kept watching, it kept getting better and I must say the 7th episode was one of the best finale to a series that I have ever watched. The character developments for even the minor characters were well-thought-out and I immediately formed an emotional connection with most of them. The finale was so well done that it almost felt like an end to a show with several seasons rather than a limited series. The show also had very good messages sprinkled in between, they were subtle and didn't make me feel like an agenda was being showed down my throat. The acting was marvelous. The cinematography was great with some very impressive scene transitions. The score was amazing and really set the atmosphere and the tone of the show. If you are reading this before watching the show, go ahead and watch it. You won't be disappointed.",10
"I know only the basics of chess and am an appalling player. I understood nothing of the strategies and only barely know the names of the positions on the board. . Despite that, this was mesmerizing! It's a beautiful film cinematically. It is heartbreak and triumph. It is the good, the bad, and the ugly of humanity. It is the struggle and dedication of talent and craft. I wasn't sure this would hold my attention, but I couldn't stop watching and it! I couldn't help feeling it! I don't know how anyone made a series about chess so riveting, but it was a beauty!",8
You will binge watch this like I did guaranteed. What an amazing 8 hour movie.,10
"AT-J is going to be the IT girl of 2020's. The Queens Gambit is the perfect combination of star and script . Understanding that the clothes play a hugn roles as the title characters goes from an orphan to young woman of the 1960's, the costumer pick the perfect dresses to express Beth Harmon,s controlled feelings.This is beautifully shot and directed and is binge worthy",9
"The title says it all...not much to add, its just perfect.",10
"Captivating, mesmerising, and very beautiful.I actually stopped playing on my phone, and put it away.",10
"It was near perfect. I would have liked a little more depth of characters because they were so interesting. And I think the last episode could have been more drawn out and suspenseful. I think it would have been perfect with 8, or maybe even 10 episodes to cover what I mentioned. It was just so good that I wanted more...",9
"I am not much of a chess player; I am that not interested in the strategy game at first. But the television mini-series did keep my heart pumping fast each time the lead character, Beth moves a piece. Her journey in chess, addiction, pain and drive to become a grandmaster is addictive. And I am in love with Anya Taylor-Joy's acting and facial expressions. Worth the binge-watch. Might even push you to start taking chess.",9
"When I saw Anya Taylor-Joy on the cover I knew I had to check this out. Can't go wrong with this one whether you like chess or not. Its prolly the only chess thing on TV I've seen that doesn't feel cringe IN THE SLIGHTEST with all the use of chess terms,movements etc. Everything felt like the actors were actually chess grandmasters. Insanely good production, top notch acting, everything was on point.Although I expected it to be good, especially since its freaking Anya Taylor-Joy, I didn't expect it to be THAT good!",9
"The script and editing is just perfect that keeps you glued. Also anyone who has seen Bobby Fisher's HBO documentary would relate with his story line from KGB, Russia, Anxiety and the ending with a duel between the two (Borgov vs Harmon) representing the two Super Powers.The actors did a fine job. The ending the opening and everything in between was just perfect.Can expect an Emmy and Golden Globe",9
"There's not much story, but pleasant to watch, good acting.",7
"Takes a bunch to make chess dramatic, this show did a great job",9
"I adored it, start to finish. Everything about it was amazing. I'm speechless to how truly amazing I found it",10
"I was just searching Netflix & I didn't had any idea about the series . I started the first episode & I couldn't stop until I finish it . We need more series like that .
Anya Taylor is remarkable",10
"Masterpiece, Yeah That's How you start for a Compelling Story of this Kind... I Don't even the Adjectives to Describe this... Definitely One of a Kind... I Mean If you Look at the way She Portrays Herself, This Girl Nails the Role of Harmone AKA Beth.... Arguably The Best in Recent Times.. The Soul , And I mean Music is Top Notch... Go For It...",10
"Just an absolute joy. Just watch it.Once you start watching it, you are hooked.",10
"A stunning masterpiece, I loved every second of watching. I don't know how I'll find anything else that compares, this is some of the best tv I've seen in a long time.Acting, direction, & cinematography are all perfection, and the pace takes you throughout her growth as a young woman, which was an absolute joy to watch. The visual palette is beautifully vivid, every scene is gorgeous. The script is well-written and poignant. The characters and their relationships with Beth are emotional and yet realistically portrayed. Beth herself is quite a unique and interesting character to watch.I initially watched this for Anya Taylor-Joy, and she did not disappoint. She captures the screen with such poise and nuance that it's worth watching just for her facial expressions alone, which allow us to witness her inner life and thoughts. I felt her joy and her pain, and I rooted for her victories, despite never playing chess myself. Safe to say that I cried several times.This is my first review on here, but I felt so compelled to write this in admiration of the show. Thank you to everyone involved in creating this masterpiece.",10
"This is the only TV show that has grabbed me so absolutely, and so quickly. I hold it in the same esteem as The West Wing and The Newsroom which have been my favourite TV shows for over 20 years now.
I really hope they keep developing new seasons, it would be a massive waste to lose what this show has started.",10
What a joy to watch ! I enjoyed every minute of it . Funally again some good stuff on netflix,10
"This series is a thriller. Chess thriller. I have very little knowledge of chess yet i loved this series. The actors are really really good. The production is very detailed and good, you feel like you are in 1960's.",9
This show is filled with excitement in the most subtle of ways. The emotions played by Harmon are both natural and relatable. It's very engaging. Her demeanor and overall personality is an absolute joy to watch. The young Harmon's stubborn yet competitive nature is also refreshing to see rather than the usual male protagonists.The show is binge worthy - makes you feel like a genius because you get so immersed with the character and storyline. 10/10,10
"You'll end up like me, binge watching it until 5 AM (and I don't even know anything about chess). Very well written, directed and acted.",9
"Who would've thought chess could be so tense and exciting.
Watched all in one sitting, transitions through each episode seemless and keeps you entertained and focused throughout with ease making it an easy watch.
Acting was fantastic and heart felt.
Must watch.",9
Despite it being a good show you'd actually thought this was any European country in the 1950's and 1960's. Why? because there seems to be an awful lack of black people in this version of America. I found the unsegregated children's home a bit too far fetched as It's a rose tinted version alright but the chess play is great.Then again it's a fictional piece of work.,8
"One of the best series I have ever seen - on all levels of production: great cast all the way around, beautiful cinematography, wardrobe, music score and an engaging and addictive script! I could not stop watching and feeling everything the main character felt and everybody in between. All of it mesmerizing, so much so that I had to quickly find the cast online to prove to myself that it was a Netflix movie/series - my brain did not believe it. The ending was magnificently touching; and you come to know that the leading actress and chess prodigy has not changed in her heart - she surely remains the child in the orphanage that we saw at the very start. I cried happy tears a few times.",10
"These shows get better and better, a great script, so well acted, so well adapted by all the actors a really enjoyable great show. Bravo",10
"Music, acting, directing, story telling... This is a rare masterpiece! I couldn't stop watching!",10
"What else can be said save for spectacular?
Yeah, that's the gist of this marvel so feel free to stop reading please, and thank you.I might be biased, I love chess. I don't play and probably never will. Something about being able to see the board 16 moves 'ahead"" of your opponent is surreal and supernatural to me. For this, Grand Masters and Wizards are of royalty to this neophyte.The acting was superb. You know that moment when the lead needs to propel the story? Well that happens multiple times...kudos to all the cast.The pace was just right for anyone in any condition if you catch my drift. I binged the whole kit-and-kaboodle, and never once, considered the time, Oh so refreshing folks:)Wait. Not true. I was fast-forwarding, editing in 'mee own time' so you might want to control the throttle a bit for sure. But overall, you're looking at 1 night, or a 2 day excursion and you'll have yourself a piece of time that was not wasted.",9
"While I am an avid chess player, you do not need to love chess in order to love this series. This is the first time I have ever given a rating a perfect 10. The cast is beyond amazing, Anya Taylor-Joy did an outstanding job. The story and writing was brilliant. The cinematography was perfection and captured every little detail for the time period. The music was perfect!The only disappointment is that there probably will not be a season two.",10
"This mini series has everything one would want in a great show. Acting, cinematography, value, the whole thing. Its got ups and downs and all around. Just watch it. I dont care for chess much but this show is beyond great. Award winning.",10
"One of my favorite actresses Anya Taylor-Joy (Emma, Thoroghbreds) is captivating in this abstract, unique, compelling journey through the world of chess. The storyline tension between disaster and vindication haunts the viewer until the very end.",9
"A real thriller, a must watch. Anya Taylor-Joy is brilliant",10
"This is one of the best series on netflix, it has outstanding acting, beautiful imagery and a compelling storyline which gets you hooked from the first episode.",9
"It's very rare, at least for me, to get hooked from the very first minute. The Queens Gambit has it all; marvelous, Oscar worthy acting from the main lead, great cinematography, superb score, fascinating costumes and era representation. It's a series with hardly any flaws, with intensity that makes the audience identify with the heroin, suffer with her, rejoice with her.It's the best series of Netflix for 2020 (and perhaps for many years to come). Make sure you don't miss it. You won't get disappointed!",10
What a gem this was. Hard to stop watching. Binge-worthy for a good weekend of viewing!!!,10
"Drugs and Genius , Netflix promotional drama series of the benefits of drugs . I suppose in reality 1000s of students today are popping speed to study and enhance their intellectual stamina. Regardless is that what we have become a society of drug addicts just to achieve at academics. This movie like series is well written acted and directed but unfortunately it's message is that of loss sadness and abuse with little empathy for its characters. Performance enhancing shown in a different light .",6
"Really enjoyable series and for the reason that it is unashamedly a feel good series, yes there are some poignant scenes and even a tear jerking one toward the end but you never feel uncomfortable watching it. Most series would have had the janitor who thought her chess, arrested or fired after being accused or suspected of some form of abuse, after all a young girl spends lots of time alone with a man in a basement. Many writers could not have resisted the urge to mine this dramatic theme and pain us by seeing this man unjustly accused. When I saw they did not I knew that I ciould relax and just enjoy a high quality feel good show, much needed in these turbulent times.",9
"Isla Johnston and Anya Taylor-Joy are both superb as the younger and older Beth Harmon. I'm a chess player so the plot of this series was quite appealing to me. Just to sum it up, it's all super good and quite moving in places. I wish there were more episodes! I'm so happy it had a happy ending! I'm now in love with Anya! Wow! She was so amazing! I really have zero negative criticism of this project, five stars all around! Highly recommended! Would love to see a sequel!",9
"I don't know where to start... I am usually very critical of movies and series, and nitpick a lot. I am rarely pleased by stories and movies in general.This series although predictable due to known history and outcome, is amazing! The most prominent aspect of the series is Anya Taylor-Joy, she is truly an incredible actress, playing an amazing role with very believable and convincing acting. Anya is totally submerged into Beth Harmon, and I was totally submerged in this series. I have never met Beth Harmon obviously, and don't really know if her personality was being portrayed accurately, but Anya played an amazing character in this series.I highly recommend watching this series even if you don't like or play chess, as the focus is more on Anya's personality, struggles, and joy *during* the chess tournaments.It was an absolute joy to watch. Highly recommended.",10
Something different that wasn't about murder or teen drama! It was fascinating and had a lot of depth!,10
"I know nothing about chess, but this was just so enjoyable. The main character is very pretty in an unusual way. And exactly the same can be said about this mini series. Such a different but beautiful story about a girl/woman who goes through the most traumatizing life events in a sort of emotionally detached way while focusing on chess. And while chess is mentioned pretty much every other sentence, it's really about someone who goes through life all by herself. I loved all actors in this.",10
"I didn't really have any expectations for this but I quickly found myself hooked. All of the actors are fantastic, it's brilliantly cast and the cinematography and direction is beautiful to watch. Imo, whilst the plot had an obvious direction it was headed in, there wasn't anything cliche or annoying. In fact I think the writing on this is some of the best I've watched lately. It doesn't try too hard, it's charming and doesn't rely on style over substance. Whilst there is a downward spiral for the main character, it doesn't ever get too seedy or depressing just for the sake of it. The characters are sympathetic and heartwarming, the wardrobes and set, glorious. There was just the right amount of chess to make it accessible to someone with no understanding of the game. Very enjoyable!",10
"An actresse and Performance to fall in love with! Noticeable, close, charming and penetrating! An Amazing Cast! Believable and dynamic character relationships.
Great camera, powerful shots, lively editing, filigree but powerful narrative speed.
Costume design, a feast for the eyes!
Authentic, atmospheric light and colors with beautiful depth!
Film Music, finely tuned and balanced.
Simply Great! Fantastic.
One of the best ""Series"" I've seen.",10
Great!!! It is soo inspiring and beautifully written and produced.,10
"The Queen's Gambit
An extremely well done series.
It is designed to draw one in and binge watch to find out how well she succeeds with the seemingly stacked deck against her.
Of course, it is all propaganda.Beth is a liar, thief, drunk, drug addict, user of others to her own ends.
Her real mother and her unfortunate upbringing are supposed to elicit sympathy for her poor behavior, personal responsibility is never addressed.
All the old childish Spielberg tricks are used.
The Goodies (US) are bathed in bright light, dressed in pastels with Rockwellian behavior., all pulling for the team with implicit trust in the Captain and generally good sorts.
The baddies (USSR, once a Red always a Red) are in darkness, dressed in black, or like extras straight off the set of Dr. Zhivago, surly, bad tempered and distrustful of their aggressive leaders.The overall impression is that the goodies know how to succeed and have a good time whilst doing it but the baddies can only lose.
Whereas, due to the US Governments decades of misappropriation and misdirection of infrastructure spending the reality of the dystopian decaying wasteland is actually America.The fact that only 20% of Americans actually hold a passport, considering there is nothing worthwhile to the left/right/top/bottom of the promised land, helps immensely in furthering their isolationist belief in their superiority and acceptance of this type of brainwashing propaganda.The lead actress was very good as were most of the supporting cast.
YMMV",3
"Watched it five times last three days, the final episode I watched ten times..You don't have to know how to play chess to like this movie, you just have to like the one playing..and Anya Taylor-Joy totally nailed that part.",10
"I never intended to watch this, but I was looking for something new and this series kept showing up. Then ITFS struck. No regrets; it was an impressive and inspiring story. I say I don't cry at the end of shows, but I was proven wrong. This show made the characters people to me. I knew them, I wanted to know them, and I felt for them.I highly recommend you watch this, even if its not your preferred type of show to watch. It wasn't mine.",10
"Actually one of the best, TV series I've watched in many many of years, fantastically done ,and absolutely loved every single minute of this TV series drama.",10
I don't know how to play chess even i don't but her acting in series and story as well as relationships of her mom and her trainer you feel like worth a watch,10
"This is well worth watching, if only for the wonderful acting, brilliant costuming and gorgeous sets. Anya Taylor-Joy is simply mesmerizing.If only the story wasn't riddled with movie tropes from start to finish. We're to believe Beth is a Good Person because she has a black friend. Never mind that she is thoughtless and rude to the man who is teaching her chess, self-centered and careless of other's feelings. She even casually tosses out a new doll in an orphanage filled with little girls who would be absolutely thrilled to have one. Her dislike of dolls is just another cliche' that says in order to be a proper feminist one must despise all things traditionally valued by women. Beth is rude to the girl who invites her to a party, but we know she's a Bad Person because there's a statue in her parents yard of a black man holding a carriage lamp.The most overused Hollywood trope of all is the Christian women straight out of a Dana Carvey, ""Church Lady"" sketch. Beth has deceived them in order to get their sponsorship money, but we're clearly meant to applaud her when she rudely blows them off.All credit goes to Anya Taylor-Joy that we still like Beth and want the best for her. Her performance is worthy of a better script.",7
"Once again netflix delivers an amazing show with a great cast! The main character stays relevant until the last episode. Anya shows the best acting of her career. The script is well produced threw every episode and the director mixes all type of scenes from long and paced scenes, to a small and detailed one. De photography is well made and full of taste capable of capturing Anyas emotion threw out the show. Money well spent! Keep it coming Netflix",9
"There are few shows you will see this year or any year for that matter, that will catch you off guard the way this show will. The score 10. The acting 10. The way they develop the main character through flaws, heartache, strained relationships, addiction, and the stress of being the best in her field... 10. Notice I haven't even mentioned chess. Because, this show isn't about chess. This show is about a girl no one wanted, who was loved by the most unlikely of people, who navigated adulthood with no adults to show her the way, and who also extraordinarily became one of the greatest chess player in the world. This show is about finding your way when there isn't a way, finding family when you have no family, and finding hope when things seem hopeless. I can't think of many shows that make me cry... this one got me.",10
"I can play chess, although I haven't played for years and I was never very good. I can't honestly say I ever found chess to be 'exciting' until watching The Queens Gambit. I was completely hooked from the 1st episode, Anya Taylor-Joy absolutely nails her character and fully deserves an award for her acting. As a TV series the story and characters get to develop the way a movie never could.
It bears repeating, I never had any real interest in chess and, before this, you couldn't have convinced me that a series about chess would ever interest me. I was SO wrong. This is easily the best show I've watched all year and I can't recommend it highly enough.",10
"The best mini series of recent times. Extraordinary holds a lot of attention. Impeccable performances, safe driving, smart script. AWESOME!!",10
"As an avid chess player my whole life this movie was an interest when it came out. I was however un-prepared for the masterpiece that was delivered! This movie was nothing less than a once in a lifetime masterpiece, perfect in every single aspect. There have been few stories that moved my soul the way this story has done.The writers, director, cast, filmography and crew created a story and brought it to life in epic proportions. I feel like.. well, to be honest, I cannot find the words to describe the experience I had watching this series, it was life changing, eye opening.. I will forever value this blessing of having the opportunity to experience such a story.Simply MAGNIFICENT...",10
"A perfect yarn spun by the director, actors & the rest of the production unit in creating this underdog drama about chess.. I'm so glad Netflix has picked up this incredible series.I loved every minute of it & there are a few episodes that I've already seen a few times.The music is outstanding & recreating the Cold War era & those iconic chess tournaments is just a master stroke.A limited series with unlimited satisfaction, enthrallment & perfect climax !!",10
"A rare and remarkable mix of highs and lows. Individualism, teams, cultures, addictions and an array of lots in life. Our girl leans into the wind. Stoic yet full of passion. Elizabeth is driven; and driven by her struggles. Her losses escort her to excellence, while clarifying her identity along the way. She knows both winning and losing like most of us.",10
"One of the best I've seen for many a year.Everything about it is topnotch. The audience is treated as intelligent enough to work out the finer points for themselves.The script, direction, cinematography and production are gobsmackingly brilliant.And the cast? Not a false note. Utterly believable. I was riveted. and the ending? Perfection!Kudos to all.10/10",10
"Look, this might be the best series I've seen in years, and I don't take that lightly. As a watcher who has been turned off by series after series that have gone the way of appeasing different demographics of people, I found myself with each episode just asking myself, what is happening here? I LOVED the main character, and when I say loved, I mean I genuinely fawned over her. She never did something that left you saying, ""why the hell would she do that?"" or ""that doesn't make sense!"" She was built in 7 episodes better than most characters I've seen built in dozens and dozens. Let's talk about the side characters - Nobody really dominated the supporting character role aside from maybe her Mother, who was pleasantly flawed but as nurturing as she could be given her circumstances. Her relationships were complicated and fascinating, starting with the janitor, Schaibel all the way through to her arch nemesis, the Russian Grand Master, Vigor. You felt every emotion she went through, without it jumping out from the screen and slapping you into submission. And the ending wasn't written in a way to over-complicate and outsmart the watcher at home, it was brilliant. This will set the stage, and the bar, for other short mini-series that have gone the way of writing with everything but the story, and the characters, first.I just finished the last episode and couldn't wait 30 seconds to run to the computer and type this review. That in itself exemplifies how amazing this series was. WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU WAITING FOR, WATCH IT ALREADY!!",10
"This show is nothing short of brilliant! Every episode's storyline is more intriguing than the last, and I thoroughly enjoyed watching it through the end. I recommend this show to anyone who wants to binge-watch because I had to finish once I started.",10
"This is the best series I've watched in a very long time, I couldn't stop watching & binge watch the entire series in one day, I hope this isn't the end of Beths story & there will be many more seasons to come",10
"This is the best series I've watched in a very long time, I couldn't stop watching & binge watch the entire series in one day, I hope this isn't the end of Beth's Story And that there will be many more seasons to come",10
"So sat down and started watching, 10 episodes later! I just let them play one after the other. Wonderful actress!!!!! This series is much better than anticipated. Highly recommended",10
"I rarely give a 9 but this one deserved it.the characters are complex, the story is compelling.the acting is great.i love how it's about womanhood at the end of the day.But what I love the most is how I could relate to it. Ultimately it's about conquering your demons and no matter what life has dealt to you, you can rise above it.",9
What a phenomenal performance by Anya Taylor.Everything in this series is way beyond anything.One and only series made on Chess and with such a beauty.I feel too emotional while watching this show and connected in plot in such a way that I just binge watch all episodes.Thanks to Netflix for bringing such a great work.The animations of chess on the ceiling is marvelous and whenever the scene came I got goosebumps.A lot similar to Pawn sacrifice movie but this show contains so much more.For all the chess players this is a must watch series.,10
"This is one that you have to see to the end. It won't let you down. If you liked ""The Hustler"" (based on a novel by Walter Tevis who wrote the novel that was the basis of this film) and the acting that made that story breathe, dance, and take you to the extremes of human triumph and defeat and everything in between, then this series is for you.Great atmospherics that make a perfect setting for fiction that creates reality without any schmaltz. Taylor-Joy is the real deal and is able to pull off everything that's thrown at her. And the rest of the cast make her even more believable. This is a treat from start to finish, and don't get distracted by thinking it's about chess-anymore than ""The Hustler"" is about pool.",10
This is a Netflix gem....should be an Academy Awards Winner for best series or definitely an Emmy for best mini series...,9
"I've seen quite a bit of chess movies and this one is by far the best. It combines the quirks of being a savant at a game and the underlying issues that come along with it. Generally the game of championship chess is extremely boring as it usually takes 2 hours a game, regularly 10-20mins/move. This movie speeds all that up yet keeps things grounded and interesting.The acting is really good and it has enough drama and tension besides chess. I definite must watch",9
Watched it in 3 nights - kept getting better and better. Had no expectations and was an amazing surprise!,10
"If you love Good movies. If you appretiate great acting, and cinematography, then don't skip this series.",9
Truly mesmerizing show. One of the first unique things to hit Netflix in quite a while! I don't write reviews often but this one deserves it. Just watch it.,9
"Honestly don't know what to say other than some shows are executed perfectly, and this is one of them. Not only is the story and the chess playing rich throughout the series, but everything is shot beautifully and matched with a fantastic score. The occasional flare of contemporary music gave the show character to match the lead role played by Anya. She plays this part flawlessly and owns every scene with her presence. The supporting cast is good as well, although none really stood out other than her adoptive mother.",10
"Seven episodes that you wish would go on forever. Great writing, great direction and editing, the two actresses that portray the lead character at two stages of her life couldn't be more talented and engaging. This series and it's cast are going to sweep the Awards next season. I love chess but my wife doesn't play and she was as hooked as I was. We highly recommend it.",10
"This was such a joy to watch. Tremendous performances by an excellent cast.The story moves carefully, thoughtfully, and deliberately. Yet there's a tension throughout. It's never predictable. Beneath it all is the backstory of the history of gender roles and underlying pervasive misogyny. Beth is forced to play the game in life and on the board.I loved every minute of it.On another level, I have to take note of the sheer unanimity of great reviews for this series. I don't think I've seen anything else that so unites everyone in the magnitude of appreciation. This is an achievement in and of itself in my book.",10
"Netflix'S The Queens Gambit is the story of an orphaned girl who is a child prodigy chess player in a male dominated sport in the 60's... it is her coming of age between career and love and where she fits in the world, while she is haunted by the past and the people that try to touch her heart through the burden of her dreams of success.Anya Taylor - Joy's unique haunting looks and beautiful acting craft is just the beginning of great things to come",9
The actors. The dialogue. The plot. Everything about this series is perfect. Anya Taylor-Joy is the only actress that could have pulled off this character.,10
"Firstly, I was amazed by the imbd score! Unusual in itself, despite probably being by a self-filtering process as people who don't enjoy a more cerebral plot will just not watch this... But for those who are able to move past this self-elimination process, this is awesome viewing! For those that don't watch this series, a pity as this series cuts across so many socio-economic and political issues of the 20th century. Her children trauma started long before her parents died and she was put in an orphanage. It's the anti-social out workings in a society with strict defined gender roles that is fascinating to watch. I'm finding the series extremely compelling! Definitely recommended, whether it is your usual type of program or not!",10
"Because you don't want to miss a moment. Sure, it has the typical hollywood stereotypes so popular now but still it's a beautiful story, and it's a nearly perfect production.",9
One of the best netflix series the performances by the new Hollywood talents Anya Taylor joy masterful,9
"Amidst so much recent mediocrity in a world gone crazy, Gambit is a relief desperately needed, smart, down-to-earth, mesmerizing, incredible acting, beautifully set, a music list that brings you back, an almost constant storm of human flaws colliding with human ingenuity.It's also a truly hilarious movie. The comedy can be subtle, but I found myself on multiple occasions bursting out in laughter at the delicate, cutting edge wit sprinkled in at the perfect time, and of course, who can stop watching in the middle of a series that incites so much raw emotional energy.In what is apparently a long and illustrious career of good works, Messr. Frank has outdone himself with this masterpiece.",10
"The original novel by Tevis is by far the best chess story written, also for people as I who know little about the game. This adaption is just as amazing. The lead character is played with masterful grace and beauty. Everything about it is top shelf.",10
"I just dreamed another life and woke up feeling elevated.
This quality miniseries delivers perfectly balanced experience to submerge into another world; world of chess, addiction, abandonment, balance, possibilities, grit, excellence, achievement and greatness. All that without dulling your mind with useless subplots and stealing your attention for month at a time with seeming infinite storytelling.",10
One of the best things I've seen!! Fantastic entertainment. Made me want to get the Chess board out again!,10
"I watched the series in a day, it was enchanting I couldn't stop watching. The cast is marvelous and the plot-line is fantastic. The actors portrayed the parts in the best way possible. The footage are astonishing. Highly recommended!",10
"What an absolutely beautiful story this is.
Surprised me at every turn, with every episode just as wonderful as the next.
Ending of ep one had me laughing and hooked.
The main character Beth is a delight to watch throughout.",10
"I just watched it, all 7 episodes, in just 2 days, 7 hours of incredible cinematography. The acting of the main protagonist (Beth) is captivating. The plot and cinematography are pure magic. Definately will go straight to awards. The best thing I have watched for maaany years. Mesmerising. I wished there was another season.",10
"But a bit afraid that the full score might look false and fake like those fake promotion reviews. This is such a fascinating viewing experience. The leading females of the child in the orphanage and the one who later grew up to be the young woman are both fantastic casting jobs, and they've proved to be excellent and perfect choices. Kudo to the production team's great achievement from the playwritters, director and everybody, all of them involved in this series.
The young actress has an unique facial features, sometimes looked a bit weird and abnormal, but the more you looked at her and her acting, she'd have gradually won you over and transformed into a rare beauty with so unique talent.
This is such a exquisite series and very exciting to watch.
Wholeheartedly recommended.",10
"Not the type of show I would normally look to watch but I was captivated from the first minute to the last. One of the best shows I have watched in a long time. Acting, Directing, costume was superb. Don't miss out !!",10
"Let me start saying that I'm the guy who always reads reviews but never writes them. This series, however, deserves recognition, from the beginning to the end of it.It has a great plot and every single character on the series are unique and well developed in their own way.I won't spoil anything. Queen's Gambit has seven episodes and what may be the greatest finale I have ever seen.",10
"Cool stuff. Gothic architecture, Hotel jumping. Luxury cocktails. Whats not to like?",5
"The visualisation, dialogue, characterisation, costumes and most of all storyline are flawless. Making me want to not stop watching what happens next is great and makes me think about it when not watching. There is a constant intrigue to main characters back story but also future. Can't wait to see what they do with this",10
If you play chess you won't find any flaw in this mini-series,10
"For all its stylish good looks, I found the story ponderous, repetitive and clichéd. The self destruct element of the heroine, in particular, seemed forced. The final episode was so painstakingly slow, I had to resort to the +10 sec button throughout. I know for sure, I missed nothing. Relieved to the finally see the credits roll. That said, the performances were good and the chess aspect, authentic and serious.",6
"I just stumbled upon this show and it captured me. Made me bingewatch. I finished the series within 2 days. When I didn't watch, it, it made me think about it. Good script, loved the actors, great acting and beautiful cinematography! Don't miss this one!",10
"I still don't understand the high rating, nor do I understand what this series was about? An alcoholic prodigy, one who has zero emotional quotient, with an equal absence of expression on her face? Did we really need another Kristen Stewart? There is just some chess lingo thrown here and there to make this look like a well researched chess series, it is not. It is a story about a spoiled orphan brat who loses everything because of her alcoholism, sleeps with a few men, and then try to use them for her own benefit. That's a good summary of this entire series. Oh, and there is a woman of certain ethnicity to make sure the series is inclusive of them, although I still wonder why we do not have same woman of certain ethnicity as the protagonist. Oh no, that would be outrageous right? And find there is the right amount of ""hate the Communists"" thrown in to make sure the series fits right in, although someone should remind the producers that USSR/Russia produced some of the best Chess players, ever.And dear Hollywood, it's kind of getting tired on hearing the same ""men are evil, don't listen to them"" over and over again in every series, movie, documentary. There is a dialogue here where Beth's mother tells her that men will come in her life who would mostly be incompetent telling her what to do, never listen to them. And what happens to Beth's mother with this excellent life choices? She commits suicide.I don't understand the high rating, have people stopped watching good movies, or are they being paid to provide a higher rating! Anyway, do not bother watching it, you can take my advice because I did so that you don't have to.",2
"I don't really watch too many movies. Some I find are difficult to hold my attention. Occasionally good ones come along. When I saw the Netflix advertisements for Queen's Gambit, I thought I might enjoy it. After all, the young actress was rather captivating in The Split.Boy was I way off!First off, the production values were unlike anything I've ever seen made for TV. The 60s were vividly brought back to life, with dazzling colors that rivaled any feature film. There were lots of new faces in unconventional roles. Or maybe they were just faces i hadn't seen, but they were all quite good and interesting!Now let's get to what holds it all together and makes it work.The young actress' name is Anya Taylor-Joy. Remember that name. She is the new ""it"" girl. Her features are as striking as Jennifer Lawrence, or Julia Roberts when they first achieved stardom, but she's also got a hypnotic quality that you don't often see.. She is in practically every scene, and is what made this guy who has a hard time sitting thru a two hour movie watch a 7 episode mini series in two days! If that's not the sheer definition of star power, I don't know what is!However, if there was one thing I found a bit disturbing, was one character frequently called another character a racial slur as a term of endearment. Why include something like that? Still, I would say watch Queen's Gambit for a very well done mini series that centers around chess, has wonderful production values, great acting, and the magnetic Anya Taylor-Joy at the center of it. You won't be disappointed.",10
"A Netflix Original limited series that boasts an exceptionally well told coming of age story, powerful themes involving overcoming addiction and an absolutely brilliant cast! Easily digestible for people without extensive chess knowledge and all the more satisfying for people with it. Highly recommend to everyone with a Netflix subscription. Happy Watching!",9
"This is one of the best series I have ever watched. All characters had their flaws, but nothing got over-dramatic or even worse melodramatic, so that they all remained deeply human. Taylor-Joy was a revelation, but the whole cast was simply superb. No flying superheroes, no fire dragons, no murders, only brilliant acting. The only thing I regret is that this was a limited series.",10
"Beautiful chess story, ever seen! and great actor anya taylor joy "" beth harmon"" 10/10",10
This series will fascinate you. Watch and enjoy the beautiful and well writted story. Plus the really good acting by almost all of the characters.,10
I watched this as I lay in bed with a cold and couldn't get enough and would watch it again. A great film with a damaged but strong young woman trying to make her way.,9
"Queens gambit manages without usual tropes or the usual story telling tools. There is no villain, no quest to save the world, no big romance story about the one true love and even the topic of chess players sounds boring.
It is all the more wonderful how great this show turned out to be! It is simply a girls story and her obsession to become one of the greats when it comes to chess.What makes it work are the perfectly written and played characters. Every performance fits like a glove, every expression tells you so much and I genuinely felt tension in God damn chess games I couldnt even follow properly because of their pace and strategies.There isn't really much more to say, this show is near flawless in execution. Although admittedly the narrative felt a tiny bit unfocussed at times in the second half.",9
"Definitely, the best series i have watched recently. If you like success stories, you should watch it. If you also like chess, you must watch it. Acting, cinematography, art directing and soundtracks, all are outstanding. I enjoyed every moment of it. Time flies when you are watching it and it ends just in the way it should be; such a warming end in cold Moscow, I can't think of a better ending. Final words;It is impossible not to be checkmated against the charming gazes of Anya Taylor Joy, such beautiful eyes.",9
"There are no words. As simply as that!
Unbelievable, I am in absolute shock. Haven't felt like that since Forrest Gump.
What a story line, performances, scenery, an unspeakable greatest of the music.
A thousand times bravo!!!
Wish there will be more
Great job.
Well done!",10
"This show is a master piece in acting and writing, It invigorated my love for chess and you can count me as a new Anya fan :)",10
"I have never been a fan of Chess. I played it a few times as a kid never understanding the depth of it and when I started to understand the depth of it I lost interest.
It is simply not my kind of game.
With that said. This mini series about a young woman who as a girl starts playing chess down in the basement at a orphans school with the local janitor and her way into the world of chess is simply one of the better things I have ever had the luxury to watch.
I think what drew me into this mini series was that while it is focused a lot on the world of Chess, it is so much more. Her own personal journey through her early life from being a young girl to becoming a young woman and how to navigate a world where you have a troubled past was really well made and emotional.I honestly started thinking ""this has to be based on some real life person?"" but no, it is a fictional story. It is that well made. It is that convincing.If you want to see a well crafted Drama with good acting, a superb script, well made editing and everything you can think off.
Nothing is left behind even minor characters are given enough time that you actually get to *know* them, their personalities and so on. That is a luxury that we are not treated with all too often in tv shows or movies these days.Don't hesitate to give this one a chance. It just keeps on delivering all the way to the end.",9
Loved watching this show - the score is amazing and I found the storytelling gripping. The characters were great! Overall great series!,10
"The story is great, writing is great, the acting is really good, but I'm getting tired of being talked down to by American television.
For about 1/4 of each episode we get to see the characters playing... Something... Its probably chess, but we never see more than 1 or 2 actual moves in succession... I dont mean that the focus should always be a perfect full length chess game, but Please! Let us see some of it at the bottom of the screen? I'm not even a good chess player, but I thought this series about a Chess player might contain a game of chess? Maybe I'm just too nerdy to enjoy American television...",7
Running out of good series to watch in the evening and happened upon this. Gotta hand it to Netflix!Cast is wonderful and direction is superb! Cinematography is far beyond what I was expecting.. and the storyline appeals to pretty much anyone with a pulse.,10
This is another excellent work that has been added to Netflix limited series. It's that kind of TV show that makes you regain trust in Netflix again.,9
"The Queen's Gambit is simply a masterpiece in every aspect of filmmaking. Absolute brilliant acting, direction, editing, production design, costuming, makeup/hair design, cinematography, and a killer soundtrack. It's an unforgettable series in a time of high expectations from all of us. As I write this the IMDB rating is 8.9 from nearly 10,000 reviewers. How can that many of us be wrong?",10
This Queen will take you along with her journey and you will be left with an awe and warmth in your heart.The Queen's Gambit was much needed for this 2020.Loved every moment of the series.,10
"This series has been something I have been looking forward to for a month or so. When I heard that Bill Camp and Thomas Brodie-Sangster would appear, I was overcome with excitement. I was actually very excited when I heard that Scott Frank created, directed and wrote the majority of the show. I love his work, particularly Logan and Godless. Now, let's talk about why Queen's Gambit is so amazing.Anya Taylor-Joy portrays a complex chess player by the name of Elizabeth ""Beth"" Harmon. By the very definition of a story, there must be a protagonist and there must be a central conflict or antagonist. I have never quite watched a show where the protagonist is also the antagonist. Beth develops addictions to pills, alcohol and several other narcotics as a way to distract herself from her life or enhance her performance playing chess.Most people will probably talk about her pills or her chess prowess in reviews, but that is not the main theme of the series. As we go through life, we are exposed to our parents, mentors, friends and, one day, lovers. This is the same journey that Beth goes through in the series. She changes as a person and her chess techniques become more advanced as her relationships morph who she is. Humans do not progress or change without the relationships we have with others.What was magical about this miniseries format was that it answers all of the key questions that we, as a viewer, can have. The finale is a fine work of art. I loved that almost every character that changed Beth was in the finale. Every aspect of her life culminates at the World Chess Championship in Moscow. This pivotal moment has been her life's work and everyone from her life is there for her biggest moment. I absolutely love this sentiment and bringing these characters back wraps every plot line in a nice little bow.The writing was phenomenal, but so was the acting. Anya Taylor-Joy, Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Bill Camp, Harry Melling and newcomer Moses Ingram elevated the script and their scenes. I think it is unfortunate that there is not more TV with a complex female protagonist. There are far too many series where there is not enough of a female presence. I loved that this series talked about key issues in our society through the lens of the 1960s. Chess, after all, is a male dominated world and I smiled each time she caused men to shake their heads or become emotional from her merciless tactics. Men always seemed to underestimate her and I loved each time she proved herself as a superior player.Well, I hope that this review was enlightening. I intentionally did not give away specific plot lines because I want the person reading this review to experience the series for themselves. I do highly recommend the series, I thought it was completely original and I hope that certain ideas the show demonstrated in certain scenes will continue through other projects or mediums. Please watch the show, you will not be disappointed!",9
"There's already enough reviews here, but this show is so good I have to say something anyway. I already somewhat liked chess going into this, but this show made it unbelievably exciting.
Of course, the show isn't really about chess, so much as it uses the game as a plot device to show the growth and development of Beth from a young kid to a famous adult, while exploring all the pain and trouble that comes from being an orphan, being exposed to drugs at a young age, being exposed to fame at a young age, etc.
Some people say they dragged the show out longer than it had to be, but I disagree. I think the added experiences makes the series more satisfying, and I, personally, never found it boring. The cinamatography and costume and set design made sure of that.
Overall, I'd call this a must watch and am already recommending it to everyone I know.",10
"Anya Taylor Joy is going to be around in a big way for a long time. She has what it takes (and not just because she has the biggest eyes since Audrey Hepburn). Her acting range is phenomenal. The story, of course, is complete fiction, as it never happened, but the production values are so good, and the writing is so realistic, that we lose ourselves in the fiction. Actually, only those who lived through the Bobby Fischer era would know right away that this is strictly fiction. Most younger people would probably buy the whole premise. Regardless, ITS A MOVIE, folks; it doesn't matter if its real or not. It only matters that it is really well done, and this one is. Don't miss it.",7
"This is by far the best show to come out of Netflix in the Covid-19 era, yet they were so humble about it. With practically no promos or A-list actors, a master piece was born. Great plot, great acting, lovely rendition of the 60s and you don't even have to like chess to enjoy this.",10
"What an excellent show and a total surprise. The artistry, the settings, the dress, the capture of the time period is an accomplishment in itself. And a great plot, great acting and storyline/plot development, really wonderful.Highly recommended, best show I've seen in quite a while...",10
"Although I enjoy great movies/series and good books, I usually find myself distracted by work or social media whilst watching or reading. It can be annoying, but I generally tend to disregard it, as I feel like I can keep focus in both places simultaneously.
However, I just finished episode 3, and I have not yet been distracted by anything - my focus is strictly on the show, because it is really intriguing to me. I love the main character's odd persona with the intuitive, striking intelligence that just puts her on a completely other level than the other kids (and also, it is very rare to see good child actors, as we saw in E1). The 60's in America is also just an interesting time to observe in film-making, as there are so many political and sociological questions, of which some can easily be perspectivated to today's society - and I feel like the series does this in a very nice way, neither too much nor too little.
I haven't read the book, so I can't say how good the series is in comparison, but I am very, very impressed so far, and I will likely be giving a 9 or 10 star rating when I'm finished with the whole series.
If you're considering watching this, you should most definitely do it. In these boring times, great stuff like this makes me really happy.",10
"A very good production indeed.Anya Taylor-Joy, who is splendid in this role, plays a genuine girl with an astounding talent, but several flaws: this makes up a realistic character which you will likely empathize with, while watching her emotional story. The performances of the other main actors are convincing too.The technical aspects, except for the CGI, serve perfectly to the miniseries, and I particularly appreciated the editing and the soundtrack. A special mention also to the costumes.Obviously it is not free from defects (besides the CGI, the main one is that some characters and some sequences are quite trivial), but they are minor, so that overall I truly liked this product.
And, let me reapeat it, how good and fascinating Anya Taylor-Joy is.",9
"Make sure to cancel your weekend plans. Binge watch alert.
One of the best series I have ever seen - on all levels of production: great cast all the way around, beautiful cinematography, wardrobe, music score and an engaging and addictive script!",10
"First of all. I can't get enough of Anyas expressive face. She's amazing.
But also the storyline, script , acting, everything! This is a fantastic story to be seen!",10
"Phenomenal show. The writing, the acting and the story. When you get the perfect balance of all 3 what you get is a gem.",10
"When I found out that this was taken from a Walter Tevis novel, I had to see it.
He's the same guy that wrote the novel that they based ""The Hustler"" on, and there are many similarities between the two books/movies.
They both take place in roughly the same time period 1950s-60s, and feature someone who is the best at what discipline they are involved in.
However, both have character flaws that get in the way of them advancing to the top of their craft, which they ultimately overcome through force of will.
There is one seemingly unbeatable master of that craft that they have to work their way up to finally facing, and they both fail at first, but eventually triumph in the end.
Both films had fine directing, acting, music (the great jazz composer Kenyon Hopkins for the Hustler) and cinematography, but IMHO the B&W grittiness, along with the jazz score of The Hustler are superior to the slick look and source music of The Queen's Gambit.",10
"I had no expectations for this show and thought being about chess it would be pedestrian or boring. I couldn't have been more wrong. I think it's one of the most accomplished pieces of television I have seen in years. The costume and production design is incredible. Each frame is like a piece of art. The music is perfect, as is the writing. Every scene is well-paced, acted and directed and stylistically unique each episode, yet cohesive throughout. Bravo! Recommend to all ?",10
This is and will be one of the best series I ever watched. Just one word of advice before you start watching it....make sure you have kept the next 7 hours free because there's no way you can stop watching it.,10
"I was hooked even from watching the preview that Netflix provides when you hover on a title. The description of the show doesn't sound like an interesting premise, but the acting, plot, and direction will keep you fully entertained. I highly recommend this series!",10
"A wonderful story with fully formed characters, a story that rolls along with few bumps and a beautiful ending. Excellent.",9
"Wow! Who knew chess would be so exciting? We may get a chess set! This show is really good. It's very fun and thrilling, which is very strange because it's chess. It's also very emotional and touching. We like the janitor and the adoptive mom. It's really a great show. Certainly a must watch! You're in for a good time. We really give it a 10!",10
"Well producer , well acting , best of the best.
A trully masterpiece . 10/10 .
????????????",10
"I had no idea what this series was about before I watched it. Even though the poster shows some chess pieces, I thought it was only used for some symbolic reason like she's a master manipulator of people. To my surprise, it really was about chess. The acting, directing, & production were all top notch for the budget, but then there were some things that really shined for me. I liked that it did not try desperately to make you feel sorry for the main character, even though she was an orphan up against some heavy odds. Some scenes were so touching and well done because it just revealed itself to you, instead of trying so hard to make you feel something - it was in a word, ""beautiful"". The portrayal of all the characters in her life was also something worth recognizing because they were not made to be stereotypical characters of parents, men, teachers, opponents - instead they actually seemed normal and not taken to the extreme, like the men are all salacious pigs, the teachers are all mean, and the step parents are evil. And, last, I would just like to say, Anya Taylor Joy looks amazing in1960's make up and clothes - especially in that last scene when she wears all white, sitting in the back of the limo - ""what is this thing of beauty?"" - she's absolutely stunning.",9
"Awesome, could not stop watching. Great story and great acting. Loved the human interactions and morels",10
"If I had to watch this again I'd lose my mind. This was such a slow moving movie that tried way too hard to be something much deeper than it really is. Run, run as fast as you can away from this series.",3
"This was such a well played out and told story from start to finish. Very well done. It was mostly clean and shows how just a great story can be done. Highly recommended. My 9 instead of 10 is just the small things that I did not like, such as a couple of brief sex scenes and two possible LGBQ moments. But, I can tell you I have recommended this show to many people.",9
This short series kept me quite captivated. I ended up watching it all within 2 days. I appreciated Beth's struggles and hard work to achieve her success. It was more realistic this way.,10
"First off, I'm a huge chess buff. The idea of a chess show got me all tingly inside just like when I watched Searching for Bobby Fischer as a child.However my gripe with this show is not that it's a coming to age story but the sexualized nature of a child from the hands of older men. Since her first tournament, there is an older man eyeing her inappropriately. She later sees him in Las Vegas and he's still pursuing her and gets her to his hotel room. She's a minor and he's old! She left and nothing happened.Later on, the main character has her first sexual experience with a person who is taking night college courses (I believe she's currently in high school) and whom she just met the same night. She's a minor.What's even more strange is her mother knows she's partying with college students that night and said ""okay"", I'll see you in the morning. This is the same mother who said she had aspirations that were pushed aside because she became pregnant. Additionally, she told the main character she will try harder as a mother. Yet throughout the film, she allows her minor daughter to drink and hang out with much older ambiguous men.",5
"A must see!
Great acting, thick plot, depth in characters, 10/10.
I had a long time to watch such a marvellous series!
Thank you Netflix!",10
"I've been a fan of Anya Taylor-Joy for several years and it never came to my mind that she could do something so wonderful outside of the horror genre. She is not only beautiful and quirky, but very classy and ladylike. Not often can I say that about other actresses of her generation, but this girl absolutely rocks. I really hope she gets many awards for her performance. This TV series gets a solid 10 out of 10 from me.",10
I never thought that watching someone playing chess can be so captivating.,10
"If you read reviews on IMDB you, no doubt, have come across the statement ""I usually don't write reviews but..."" I understand when someone uses that phrase but I find it used far too much. So it pains me to say I am one of those people. I usually don't write reviews but...this is one of the finest series I have ever watched. Quite a stout statement. Never mind that the cinematography, music and costuming are flawless, but the storyline is riveting. What's so riveting about a chess phenom series? Watch. Anya Taylor-Joy is astounding in the role. The way the film is constructed, how it pulls you along is fantastic. Watching a child genius discover her gift, and others reaction to it was a joy to watch. The fierce competition, friendships and heartache put you into the world you are watching. There are a handful of shows that are just about perfect. This is one of them. After all, if a program entertains you to no end it's done what it's supposed to do. Checkmate.",10
"I was absolutely blown away by this Netflix miniseries. They could not have picked a better actress than Anya Taylor-Joy to play the role of chess prodigy Beth Harmon, Taylor-Joy's acting is mesmerizing, hypnotic, & she brings amazing depth to this series. I also noticed that during her games she was playing fast & accurately, which tells me she must have really studied up on the game to play her part. I tried to pace myself & watch one episode per day, but I ended up binge watching it over a period of two days. Very addictive.",10
I just finished this series in 2 days. The best show I've seen in years. Do yourself a favor and savor this show like a fine wine.,10
A must watch. Something different from the usual. Very well structured.,9
"Been following Anya Taylor since The witch.i can say this is the best show in 2020, the acting, scoring, script, costume, everything is pperfect..
thank you netflix. keep climbing Anya!!",10
"The show is awesome!! We need more shows and movies with the depth, intelligence, character, and story telling like The Queens Gambit, instead of half baked remakes and sequels... if you're looking for an emotional story about a woman succeeding in a man's world, without the liberal propaganda of today being pushed in your face, watch this show! I finished it in one day and wanted more!Take notes Hollywood... less Witches (2020) and more Gambit!!!",10
"I thought the first few episodes were really enticing: A young girl discovering an escape from her life as an orphan through chess. It was something different compared to what's out there at the moment, the unique concept had me hooked, but the more the series went on it fell a bit flat for me. It turned into a ""teen girl coming of age, meeting different blokes every 5 minutes and sleeping with them"" kind of story, made me lose interest a bit. It picked up again towards the end though.The acting was good for the most part, Anya Taylor-Joy does well in her role. The cinematography was brilliant, that's where I thought this series excelled; it had some really beautiful shots throughout that help keep you immersed in Beth's world. It's watchable, very visually appealing, but like most Netflix series it just gets drawn out too much. Would have worked better as a film imo.",6
"Definetly the best netflix original serie of all time. Intense, dramatic, fun... and it's about chess?",10
"It's been a while since I've found one like this. Charming, layered, obvious, unexpected......a cinematographic game of chess.
Everything about it is perfect.",10
A brilliant performance by anya taylor. It was a great show and deserves all the praise.,10
"Simply the best Netflix show this year, set in late 60s early 70s, show casing this era to perfection, the costumes and the set were a site to behold. The series got better with each episode,original storyline, quirky humour, tinged with sadness, and great joy all wrapped up with the flawless performance of the most gorgeous Anya Taylor-Joy, She totally owned this role from tip to toe.I dont expect any other actress could have come near her performance.
The author must have been ecstatic to see her become Beth Harmon.
Of course I binge watched the first half, then slowed down once I realised there were only 7 episodes.. A rare watch again, again , masterpiece.",10
"Beautifully written, well executed story of a girl in the 1960s that fights against marginalisation with the pure power of her brain!Brilliant acting, great cinematography!",10
"What an amazing story. I never dreamt that an exciting series could be built around the game of chess. The main actress deserves an Oscar award. My only dislike was the crude language in the first scenes. Otherwise, this story would have been a great inspiration to children.",10
"The Queen's Gambit is hands down one of the best miniseries of the year and one of the best overall series of 2020. Period. It had me hooked from the first episode all the way to the last one. Very early on in the show, it becomes clear a lot of effort and heart was poured into it, ranging from the writers, to the actors, to the directors and editors.It starts us off with a killer pilot. It opens with what is presumably the show's present day, only to go back to the character's upbringings. Although the backstory may appear cliché in the surface-a misunderstood, socially awkward orphaned girl growing up in a hostile Christian orphanage-the writing is so tender and intimate, it comes off as genuine and moving rather than manipulative and cheap.For the rest of the episodes the series doesn't lose any steam. It charges on, delivering solid emotional hits in the process and nail-bitting moments of tension and drama.The characters were phenomenally fleshed out. Every single one of them felt real. The social commentary wasn't just thrown in there in order to score woke points. It was subtle, effective, and, most importantly, relevant to the story and atmosphere. The performances were all great. Anya Taylor-Joy was, as usual, excellent. All the child actors were up to the standards as well. And the whole thing was just incredibly poignant.Really impressed with The Queen's Gambit. My one and only quibble with the show was the last episode. The final outcome was great, but few parts of the episode felt a bit too over-the-top and Hollywood for me. It sticks out a bit when the rest of the series is so grounded. Nevertheless, it really is a very minor flaw. This was a project crafted with a lot of care and dedication, and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for high quality TV.",9
"Great story, no need to know anything about chess.",9
"I didn't know it was possible to make chess exciting, interesting, sexy and playful. I absolutely fell in love with the lead actress! The characters are well written and I love the story. I haven't been as excited about a serie since Chernobyl aired! A must watch and binge worthy :)",10
"Seriously i started looking at 11 in the evening, i watched it all. Couldnt sleep after i watched.Today again watched some episodes, still gave me the same feelings when i watched yesterday evening i was again amazed!First review ever i had to leave one!",10
To see an rj11 or 45 phone jack on a phone on a quality production like this is like seeing one of the actors use a mobile phone. Its so disappointing when you are really absorbed and enjoying every minute. It happens so often now in so many 60's and 70's based movies and it literally spoils the whole experience.,5
I just loved this and finished it in two days.. such a delight to binge and was sad when it was over... a must see!!!,10
"The Queen's Gambit was extraordinary, ingenious, there no superlatives adequate enough to describe it.l started watching without any expectations but from the opening few minutes of the first episode, was more than enough to keep me riveted.
And it just kept getting better and unlike many final episodes, this was exquisitely crafted and executed.Easily the best finale to a series that l've ever watched.
The character development for even the minor characters were exceptional,
the direction was so considerate that you couldn't help but form an emotional connection with all of them.The last eprisode was so well done that it almost felt like an end to a show with several seasons rather than a limited series.The Queens Gambit additionally had some very good messages sprinkled in
between, they were subtle and doesn't make you feel like an agenda was being forced on you.Acting was sublime. Cinematography too was supreme with some very
impressive scene transitions. The score was spectacular and provided the perfect accompaniment to this show.I can't express enough how flawless and thoroughly enjoyable this series is.The journey was easily one of the most exquisite entertainment experiences of my life.I rate The Queens Gambit 200/10",10
"THE QUEEN'S GAMBITThe person who has lost everything, has nothing to lose.Who would have thought that a Netflix coming of age TV series about a 1950s chess player would be so eventful and delightful.Beautiful period cinematography combines with a deft penned script to deliver one of the best human drama and inspirational series of covid-19.A lilting piano with orchestral soundtrack supports imbues an ""Alice in wonderland"" narrative sense, as a young girl takes on men in a male dominated intellectual sport during an age of chauvinism.As the girl ages, the soundtrack evolves through beautifully composed period music, which becomes more upbeat as the series and the age progresses. This is so well integrated into the story that the music itself becomes the real storyteller. You will probably want to get your hands on the soundtrack.The main character loses her parents very early in life, is orphaned and learns to become an independent thinker. Which provides us with a sense of the resilience and self reliance that is required to become successful at life and relationships.Her birth mother is highly intelligent with a bright mind at mathematics. We see very little of those sorrowful beginnings, and learn from this to not get caught up in our losses, but to focus on the using the good memories to move us forward to our happy nirvana.Our chess player has a capacity for lucid dreaming and can visualise three dimensional chest board model's with her imagination. This ability is simply and beautifully captured through some well placed CGI.The side story of the series is the relationship being formed with stepmother, conveying a sense of girl power and 'revenge through success' in a manner that is both charming and poignant to our times.As we look back to how a mother and daughter navigate their way through to their mutual independence, triumphant through their loss, we are each supported by the narrative to introspection and self reflection.There is a beautiful moment in which the main character wears her mothers night gown to feel closer to her. Anyone who has lost someone will find deep meaning and a sense of seeing themselves in the story, due to use of visual metaphors that make the emotion of the script immediately accessible.One asks,""Who am I in the context of this story?""We are each on a path to exploring new versions and reinventions of self, as we adapt to growing older and wiser in our relationship with self and others.Do what you love.
With who you love.
Make your move.GJM",10
One of the best mini-series I have seen. Every episode gets better.,10
"I am not sure that I am going to be able to articulate how this series impacted me, because it hits at so many levels that I am still sorting it out. You take in sumptuous beauty and callous ugliness; aching loyalty and heartbreaking betrayal; glorious hope and grueling despair. The last chess scene, when, clean of all drugs and alcohol, Beth gathers it all in, gazes upward to her intellect's creation of a gorgeous chessboard, and reaches beyond her grasp was overwhelming. All of the acting (but, wow, Anya!), the cinematography, screenplay, music, and costumes are works of art. Do not miss this.",10
"Great story, great acting, great cinematography, great directing, great everything! What more do you want?!
One of the best mini-series I've ever watched. Thank you.",10
The Queen's Gambit is amongst the best series from Netflix. It is engaging and gripping. The Chess game and the representation of the geniuses who are involved in this mastermind game. I loved the series. The lead is best in her performance and all the cast performed a fine play.,10
"I rarely say this, but i find it hard to find anything bad to say about this show.
You clearly do not need to know anything about chess to see this show, as you never really see a full game played.
It plays on emotion's, rather then the games it self.
I guess that in it self can be a let down to some, because the few times you think your following a game, the pieces on the board is flying randomly around, or so it seems.Then ending was sudden, but good. They set you up for more, but does not deliver. I guess have questions left for my imagination.Netflix have been disappointing again and again with shows from season 2.
But these limit series, especially this one are spot on and i could not recommend anything more.",9
This is an excellent short series. Fantastic and the acting is incredible.,10
"In fifty years of watching television, this is some of the best drama I've ever seen. Yes, it's that good. Anya Taylor Joy is mesmerising. The series tells a passionate , sensitive , moving and faultless story.",10
"Wasn't sure this was gonna be my thing, however, 7 episodes later I was praying for more... watched all the episodes in one day and was gripped from start to finish. The writing and acting was sublime
This is a must watch movie that you can't miss, but start early, it's like a good book you can't put down...
Credit to Netflix for raising the bar again!!",9
I am a chess lover myself. Fantastic tv series!! Brilliant acting!! Leaves some strong messages & impact!! Every episode is worth watching!,10
This is a nice story. The only problem I have with the production is how dark and dingy the filming is. It seems to be a trend these days along with the horrible music that we have to suffer with. Are movie sets trying to save money on lighting equipment these days? Even the outdoor scenes are dark and gloomy. Is that part of the theme? It doesn't work for me.,8
Unexpected and excellent. Would love to see more shows like this. Had to binge watch the entire series after watching the first episode. Watch it - you'll love it!,10
"Never have I been so blown away by a series I randomly stumbled upon. It is so well written, great transitions/editing and marvelous acting. Even though its a 7 episode show, I feel like I have been through a great story with multiple plot-lines all tying up at the end in one masterpiece of an episode.
The perfect balance between mysterious and exciting storytelling. A must watch in my book if you like miniseries! 10/10!",10
"What a wonderful storyline brought to life with beautiful cinematography, reminiscent music, and exceptional acting. This series deserves its rating in every way... It is exactly what a Netflix series needs to be. I thoroughly enjoyed it!",10
"Its just like a black hole once u watch the first 5 mins u feel i cant get away without watching the whole series, acting was exceptional so as every thing . it wasn't like a slow drama more than blink it and u will miss it, its full of emotions and messages, and most importantly no political agenda behind it.
recommend it strongly to everyone",10
"It's Halloween, and it's October, and I don't want to watch anything other than horror movies, but I got sucked into this show because my God it's good. I mean it's really really Good. It's so well done. You really care for the characters and it's such an amazing story.",10
"Such a great mini series.
Nothing to complain about.",10
I'm at episode 3 and it's very nicely paced with a great score that keeps it moving along quite nicely. Well acted and quite gripping so far.,9
"I have never played a single game of chess in my life, yet I cancelled a night out with friends to sit in the darkness of my room to watch all 7 episodes back to back in one sitting. This was only after watching the first 20 minutes of episode 1, because I had a feeling in my heart that I was about to witness something special. How right I was!Firstly, the soundtrack! God, the music was the perfect addition to how ""on the edge of my seat"" I felt the entire time. The soaring strings, occasional double bass and delicate piano melodies was the perfect backdrop to all the drama and Intrigue peppered throughout the series. It made my heart soar when Beth had her first victory, I had sweaty palms when you could feel the tension in her games, and when she cried, I did too. Bravo to Carlos Rivera who put together a beautiful collection of melodies!Secondly, the acting. Of course, we have to start with Anya. I have followed her acting journey from some time now, when I first saw her in the ""witch"" and this has definitely got to be her best role yet. I had to pinch myself a few times to remind myself I wasn't actually in the world she inhabited during the sixties, travelling around the world and playing against all the men. Her acting was so natural, yet nuanced, it almost made me feel uncomfortable as if I was peering into a side of her soul she didn't want to be seen. And my god, those EYES. In a series where almost all the interactions involved body language and speaking through actions rather than words, Anya was the perfect choice. I would be very surprised if she didn't get nominated, or win the Emmy. She deserves it.Of course, the story shines with the additional help of the other characters. In particular, Thomas Brodie Sangster as Benny Watts made me laugh, swoon, and rage at his often cocky yet loving personality. His and Anyas chemistry was electric. Alma, as her mother also deserves a special mention. She played the role of a neglected housewife wanting to break free from her mundane life, so well!I have watched this miniseries two times over the last three days and I STILL cannot get it out of my head. That is truly the mark of great filmmaking I think. That, and the fact I had continual goosebumps throughout the last episode. (That final game with Borgov though! Ahhh) and I have recommended this series to everyone I know. Watch it, you won't regret it.Ok, I'm off to watch it for the third time now!",10
"I was hooked on binging this Netflix mini-series, ""The Queen's Gambit,"" at the end of the second episode, when Beth Harmon's (Anya Taylor-Joy) adoptive mother (Marielle Heller) begins supporting her daughter's playing in chess tournaments. With the colorful 1950s-1960s settings, it became like a less-moody ""Mad Men"" romp across the country and, then, the world. Socio-political issues of the times are sometimes superficially addressed and there's the drug-addiction throughline, but none of it, fortunately, is treated too melodramatically. What I especially came to appreciate about the show, however, is some of the ways it treats its protagonist's gifted mind.Sure, there's the usual trope of genius bordering on madness and the mommy and daddy issues, and she's naturally exceptional. But, Harmon also reads a lot, and we see her reading. She studies and plans her moves away from the board, and we see her doing that. Heck, it's a game where players take notes during professional matches. She learns from talking over the game with experts and friends. She's passionate and intellectually curious; that's what led her to learn chess from a janitor in the first place. It's what led her to take classes to learn Russian. To compare ""The Queen's Gambit"" to another picture of a troubled savant emerging from custodial work, we don't merely see Harmon doodling nonsense equations on a mirror or chalkboard as in ""Good Will Hunting"" (1997) and speed reading books at night only to spend days employing that knowledge to humiliate antagonists in between performing manual labor and drinking with buddies. It surely helps, too, that ""The Queen's Gambit"" is adapted from a book and that they hired a grandmaster to design the chess moves. Taylor-Joy, reportedly, related the chess matches to her experience with dance, and there's indeed a rhythm to these scenes that works even for someone like me who doesn't play chess.",7
"Ana Taylor-Joy is simply mesmerizing. If anyone did not recognize this young English actress before, they will after watching this superb limited-run series. Great things lie ahead for her, and for her audience.The direction of this show stood out for me. The director made chess exciting, imparting just enough knowledge to appreciate the game at the highest level. The special effects were a perfect device for showing how an world-class player thinks so many moves ahead. Overall the look was gorgeous, the pacing spot on, the tension perfect.Well done Netflix . This makes up for those boring warrior Princess shows. Now get this production team another project ASAP..Now, back to figuring out what to watch.",10
"Beautifully written, beautifully shot, beautifully paced and beautifully powerful. In Anya Taylor-Joy a powerhouse of acting prowess is born. I knew of her from appearances in Shyamalans long awaited flops, but this will make her a household name. What a performance. Delivers the deeply flawed side of Beth flawlessly while bringing a class and style not seen in a long time. This has adverse childhood experience, troubled youth, chess, Cold War, communism, addiction, greed, jealousy tenderness. A must watch!!",10
"I went into watching this show without any expectations as I knew nothing about chess or its rules. But after watching first 2 episodes, I had an urge to learn everything about chess. The acting is great and the story is so captivating throughout. So really this show makes you wanna learn and play chess even if you know nothing about it! Highly recommended from my side.",9
"Haven't seen such a good movie since years!
Wow!!!
Mind blowing!",10
"This is such a compelling show about the game of chess, checked out first episode and before I knew it I was on episode 4, the next day I had to buy a chess set cause I forgot how much I love to play",10
"Everything about this series is perfect. Plot, character development, the score, love it.",10
"Superb acting and good atmosphere of the 60's.
I think many poeple will discover what chess competion is.
It is of the same quality as Minhunters .
Don't miss this show !",10
The series is so well directed. The storyline was very intriguing yet smooth to watch. It's such a delight to watch something with a new concept. This show empowers women while making you fall in love with chess gradually. Definitely a binge worthy show.,10
This series was amazing from start to finish! Totally watching it again and will buy if I can??????,10
You don't have to know or like chest to love this movie! Loved it the whole way through!!,10
"...and likely the best Netflix mini-series ever. Everything from the acting, cinematography, score, etc. were phenomenal. The character development for a 7-episode series was unparalleled. I felt like I knew each of them and how it all came full circle was uncanny. Anya Taylor-Joy was at her best, but the supporting actors/actresses were also incredible. I started this series half-heartedly, something more for background noise, but came out as one of my favorite series of all time. It was truly enticing, heartbreaking, and inspiring. It is an absolute must watch.",10
"One of the best Drama tv series I have seen in a very long time, if not ever. Definitely recommended.",10
"TLDR: The story is riddled with good intentions and interesting character development, but truly lacking in ways that would make this actually a feminist story featuring a rare truly brilliant and strong female lead.I found this show quite engaging to watch (especially because I initially thought it was true), but by the end, I felt despite the complexity of the lead character, everything was too tidy and wrapped up, and very clearly written from the male's perspective (it was a male author of the book after all).The main character, Beth, is wonderfully acted by both the young and the adult actresses, but as her character ages, her complexity weakens, and she becomes the traditional trope of a woman in need of a man to truly feel worth by the end.Please do not keep reading if you don't care for very mild spoilers.We see Beth pine over a much older man that tries to sleep with her in a Las Vegas hotel room when she is just 15-16, whom she eventually ends up with. The hotel room scene was one that bordered on grooming a young lady after seeing her blossoming sexuality, and felt uncomfortable. Yet by the end we're supposed to buy this as a true connection? And the reason she's able to believe in herself and push through to success? Could a female character this brilliant not ever have done this on her own?!Also in the end, she can only find her true success by working with others. A seemingly great message, but why are ALL of the others she works with male? All the other female characters in this story are portrayed as little poos. There's the french girl who goads Beth into a bad situation, her mother who is a drunk and an addict who enables Beth... and then there's the sole other female chess player who Beth completely treats like a blip on the radar (which somehow she NEVER does to a single man in the entire storyline, not even a 13 year old).By the end, everything is to clean and tidy, when Beth's whole life to that point was anything but. Everything is wrapped with a pretty pink bow. There are no questions left unanswered. There is nothing unbelievable. It's generic and predictable.Overall, it is a fun show and worth a watch. But at the end of the day, it is, but yet again, a ""strong female"" story written through the lens of a man.",8
"This show definitely surprised me how good it was. With the perfect mix of tragedy, downward spiral, while at the same time successfully bring a smile to my face. The cinematography also made what can seem like a very boring game to watch to some into one that kept me at the edge of my seat. This show really felt perfect. So much so that I think a second season would ruin the beauty of this show. Though if there was one, I would definitely watch it.",10
"Compelling from the start! Well acted, beautifully shot and well written. So worth the time.",9
"No inflated ratings here. The series is perfect in every way. Sometimes a rare show or movie comes a long where you just want to savor every second of it, and when it is over you feel bad that you watched it as you wish you could see it all over again fresh.It really does not even matter if you care about chess or even understand it. Chess is an old and esteemed game but the club is rather small . I just have a cursory understanding of the game myself from very casual play as a child, where one learns how the pieces move and you play with other kids with no strategy at all.The series production takes a very interesting approach to the actual ""chess"" action. In all, there's really not much direct chess action, but almost every game is choreographed differently, from the setting and music to the surrounding atmosphere or ""goings on"". To point, during the key games you see more of what's going on around the game than the game itself. It's like the director knew that most folks don't want to watch a show about people moving chess pieces across a board. Yet, all the suspense and drama is captured perfectly and it is fascinating.Mostly though, 'Queen's Gambit' is a human story. A coming of age drama about a girl coming from a difficult background, who just happens to be a genius and a prodigy. It's this development and progression from an early age, and the struggles along the way, that really captures your heart. All played wonderfully by a beautiful and talented up-and-coming (or has she arrived) actress in Taylor-Joy. I was already familiar with Joy from movies like ""The Witch"" , ""Split"", and some smaller stuff, but I think this is the work that will skyrocket her. The supporting cast also does an excellent job here, but this is Taylor-Joy all the way and she rocks it.Overall, this series is very uplifting. It touches on some darker subjects related to her childhood and addictions but, in my opinion, never enters truly melodramatic territory. And I think that works well here. The ending is fantastic....and yet very down to earth.Do not hesitate....watch. I can't recommend this enough. Best thing I've seen on the small screen in a long time, and I'd go so far to say that this is the best Netflix Original to date.",10
"A remarkable tale of a female's journey from childhood to young adulthood. Set in the 50's/60's era, it captures so many aspects of this thing called ""life"". A ""queen"" emerges from dust, cardboard and a few plastic pieces worthy of royal titles. Brilliant!!",10
"Finished in a day, bunch watching till 6pm :) The show is the best series everrr. I must say its one-of-a-kind. Combining a bunch of things from addition, winning obbsession and even fashion. The cinematography: just one word ""excellent"". Anya Taylor-Joy (Beth aka chi yeu) is superb in the lead and i cant keep my eyes off on her. Go go and get #1 netflix vietnam pls u deserve it.",10
"You should watch this show!! Its story is captivating, acting was superb, amazing ending, netflix made it right this time!!",10
"Just finished watching The Queen's Gambit on Netflix and it was nothing short of amazing and without any of the useless trendy trash in there. Just a beautiful, well presented mini series that was realistic but with a certain cinematic nostalgia to it for that hint of warmth. It highlighted on darker issues of the mind with the softest touch of a feather.
A Goodwill Hunting/Beautiful Mind meets Anne of Green Gables with a sprinkle of Eurofilm edge. An accomplished, beautiful watch.",9
Well written and performed. Reminded me of stories my mom told in the orphanage she grew up in,10
This was one of the best shows ever made! At the end of the last match I got chills up my arms. Anya Taylor-Joy absolutely crushed this role! She left me speechless with how marvelous she was in this show.,10
"I have no interest in Chess but I recognized the girl so I figured I would check it out and ended up watching the entire thing in one sitting. I wish it was based on a true story. My only complaint was the drug use, not all of the drug use in the show, just one specific drug and the reason that made it an integral part of the story that just didn't seem necessary. Although, this is going to completely contradict my last sentence but the drug and it's use I'm referring to was absolutely necessary for the last scene of the first episode and my favorite scene of the series",10
"I was slogging thru my Netflix offerings, willing to watch any piece of crap they threw my way when I halfheartedly clicked on The Queens Gambit. Normally I bail after 10 minutes but this one had me totally mesmerized from the start. I'm now on Ep 5 and it just keeps getting better. Watch it you will love it.",10
"I enjoyed watching Beth develop as a talented chess player, meeting the interesting characters who were part of her life and the pitfalls she faced along the way to reaching her goal. The story was excellent. But at top level chess, it was not realistic in that chess matches resulted in either wins or losses, and draws rarely occurred. In reality at this level of chess players are so evenly matched and draws are a frequent occurrence. At the last 4 world championships won by Magnus Carlsen, he had to settle for draws in the vast majority of his games. At the 2018 world championship with Caruana, all 12 games were draws and it had to be settled with a rapid chess tiebreaker. Even when Fischer beat Spassky in 1972, more than half the games were draws.",8
"From start to finish this limited series is masterful. I have absolutely nothing but positives to say. Don't hesitate, watch it and enjoy - it is sure to claim some emmys next year. Fantastic.",10
"Who cares about chess? the director of this show could make anything suspenseful and exciting. More intense and consuming then any show I've ever seen. My favourite show is breaking bad and this may give it a run for its money. I am shocked by how incredible it was; I only wish there was more, although I feel a very satisfying relief that it is over. I am a 22 year old male and I was not interested when I saw it but trust me, it is so worth it. I just finished it and made an account to write this review, if anything is worth watching, it's this.",10
"I expected to be bored; I was enthralled, captivated, mesmerized (yes, I know, 3 things that all mean the same thing)
Words cannot accurately convey the right 'mood' this series conjures in my mind.Everything about this series is brilliant. The writing, acting, casting, cinematography, music, hell, even the wardrobe was perfect.Watch this series. Fall in love with the story, AND the characters.You'll be glad you did.One last thing; Anya Taylor-Joy is the next IT girl in Hollywood. A prediction.",9
"Most amazing show i've ever watched. The story telling, the camera, the actors (especially Beth), the settings and scene, the music, the mood, the feeling, the intensity, everything!A masterpiece you need to see!",10
"I never thought I'd enjoy watching a series about chess. I know nothing about the game and figured it would be boring. I really actually put it on for background noise while I was coloring in my adult coloring books( I know I am a nerd) but then I started watching it. It captivated me and the lead actress Anya Taylor joy it's stupendous in this. I ended up starting it and watched the entire series and didn't get to bed until six in the morning. I cannot wait for season to. I really would recommend this to anyone. Even if you're not interested, or don't know anything about chess.",10
"From time to time a masterpiece comes along...absolutely magnificent. Amazing lead actress. A compelling story, and great cinematography.",10
"Just finished the movie and feeling empty like abondened someone kk. It is such an interesting movie and every single ep is worth to watch! I even start to think about when will be the next season reveal and also where to find the movie just like this one. Applause to the director, actors, actresses and all the people who work on this movie",10
"Surprising piece of TV.
Never heard of it, didn't expect much from a show about chess, from the screaming girl from Split and the boy character I disliked in GoT.
But someone mentioned I should take a look and probably one of the best shows of 2020.The cinematography is great, the props team have made an amazing effort and acting is damn good all through.If this doesn't take Anya Taylor-Joy places there's something wrong with the World.
If this had been a movie I'd say it's Oscar worthy.If I were to complain about something is the predictable script. But that goes for 95% of everything so...",10
"Why the high rating, well, after a very slow start in the first episode, if you continued to the second episode like I did, only because I am stubborn and do not like to be left confused by a show. And while that first episode is difficult to watch and comprehend, the second episode makes up for that in spades.
The second episode makes the first episode clear, and now I understand why they made the first episode heh.Once Elizabeth is freed from the orphanage, she slowly and gradually gains her wings. She is an Introvert, and chess genius, and very pretty, (for a girl chess genius) Had to add that part in because the world of chess is dominated by men. And especially during the time period of this piece.You will find the costumes to be beautiful, and telling a story rather than just being a part of the show in and of itself. You can gain knowledge from how well Beth Harmon is dressed at any given time. This Annabelle has very intriguing and beguiling eyes, and they tell so much without words.Do not miss out on the Queen's Gambit, it is worth the seven hours of your life you will be as sad as I am that there were no more stories for our heroine Beth Harmon!",9
I really loved it! What a fantastic series. Have watched this in one go. I have absolutely no knowledge of chess but this remains fascinating until the end. Great job.,10
Smart. Dark. Funny. This is one of those rare gems that is entertaining on every level. Brilliantly executed story from start to finish. A perfect mix of intellect and wit. Whoever is behind this please keep it up.,9
I can't understand the glowing reviews for this series. Well acted and nicely shot but the story is uncompelling and drawn out. The book may have made a good stand alone movie but the story was far too dragged out for a seven part series. Pretty dull.,4
"Lol. I've heard only 10% of the population know how to. Any ways. This gave me an appreciation for the game but something was lacking? I enjoyed this but I can't put my finger on it? Maybe the way Anna plays the character? So monotone. For example the last episode was my favorite. It made me ""feel"" emotions and even cry. I think there was emotional miss/loss throughout that could have been captured better.SPOILERS: the mothers death. Her romantic relationships. The scene in the bar where she claims love still( for whom I don't know, couldn't hear) wasn't effective since we never really see any male relationships except briefly and they don't build well on them. Also they bring back many characters later in a scene where they go over moves to defeat Borgov felt flat as I didn't remember half of them. Also the scene in the last episode with the reporter( wasn't he a previous defeat?) and them talking about how she broke his heart??? I remember them briefly hanging out and a half naked male walking out into the room and her leaving. But have no idea the situation and later doesn't explain any of it either. You could honestly watch the first few episodes and the last and get the same affect. Any ways enough rambling. It was a good watch just lacking something...",7
"How can i give it 9! There is nothing this show is missing i cried at a time and i got excited at another , i smiled i grieved i felt happy and hopeful i cant mention one feeling i didnt catch in this show
The chess games were detailed i stopped at some scenes to make my move and see what they will do
Her act was on point
Perfectly done",10
"Netflix, please keep this gold standard going forward.
I cried at the end, I was so invested in her life from start to finish.",10
"Stunning acting, photography direction.
Very rare these times.",10
".As stated by others, I started to watch this series and I had to watch it all the way through in one binge! The Academy can save time and give the Best Actress Oscar to Anya Taylor-Joy for her portrayal of chess prodigy Elizabeth Harmon. I played 7th Board on my high .school chess team which meant I was not very good.
The story is compelling and the characters are genuine. Through Beth's journey, we witness the trials and tribulations of obsession, isolation, dependency, friendship and sacrifice.In The Queens' Gambit, I believe Netflix has created a classic film which rivals the likes of ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" Treat yourself to this amazing film!",10
"Giving a rating of 10, I need to write down something here.A movie about chess is not so promising in terms of excitement, if not the contrary, but I just binge watched all 7 episodes in 2 days!To tell the truth, I did not expect a Netflix movie series to be this good. There must be very talented and enthusiastic people in the production team, resulting in such a great cinematic experience like the Queen's gambit. Netflix, continue to go on like this and you get our support wholeheartedly!",10
"I love all things Star Trek but they have too many boring scenes, love stories, etc., that it might as well be called Soap Opera In Space. So what does that have to do with The Queen's Gambit? Just bringing up a point on how this movie was never ever boring. Always things moving, happening, growing. Loved it and ""power-watched"" it from start to finish at one sitting. I need to get out more :)",9
"This must be Netflix' best of the year, and best since Dark.Perfect drama and acting. Amazing writing.I could not stop watching once I started, and binged it all too late in the evening (morning).I think this will surprise a lot of people, that thinks this might not
be for them. This must be for aprox. everyone.10/10",10
"A wonderful fabulous quirky and unique serie which has been beautifully written, directed, designed and acted. The younger and older actresses playing the main role are perfect. Totally loved it.",10
"Sometimes I really wish I could reply to reviews directly. Someone suggesting that it is not realistic and it's cheesy simply because in reality chess players take longer to make their moves!! Are you for real? So??? There not about to draw out the games to be the full length of a normal game. Get a grip. It was visually stunning, well acted had a good story line. I would rate it a 9 normally but just for the idiocy of some of the reviews languishing around the 3-6 mark. F you I rate it 10.",10
"Watched this over 2 days, absolutely amazing! The whole sotry is well thought out and I loved all the cast. Worth a watch even if you know nothing about chess. One of the best shows that came out of Netflix this year I'd say.",10
"Stunning. Utterly absorbing. And no swearing, breasts, cgi, guns or blood. A miracle. We need so much more television like this. Making a 1960's Cold War backdrop seem so current is genius. Emmy-worthy casting, writing and screenplay, is only bested by the pitch-perfect acting from every one of the cast. In these dark times, inspirational escapism comes in no better guise. Bravo!",10
"If you know how to play chess or have knowledge about chess... it's a Must watch series.Each and every single episode is soooo perfect !!
To the point !! No drama.. no stretching the episode just to make it longer or more in number.. it's straight to the point and omg straight up perfection !!!THE CAST IS SO PERFECT OMG I CANT EVEN !!! You'll fall in love with her character !!Literally the best series I ever watched !!",10
"I just had to leave a review for such a well crafted mini-series. Perfect balance of emotion, drama, character growth and story telling and most importantly a fantastic performance by the lead actress. A must-watch!",10
"Everything about the movie is just so well-made, the story, the dialogues you don't feel nothing is forced and everything would happen as in real life. I feel in love with her character and I watched the entire show in only 1 day. what a SHOW!",10
"I cannot say more that has not been said by other reviewers. I mainly write this to make the show more popular.Netflix produces a lot of ""good"" shows that are well made and entertain you well enough. But this one stands out!The cinematography is amazing to look at and reminds me of David Fincher. It plays with geometry and symmetry that is very fitting to the subject of chess.The characters and plot are well crafted as well. It deals with heavy subjects but in a dignified way without shocking or provocation. All characters feel like full persons and not just caricatures, and if you pay attention, surprisingly many of them get their own character arcs.The acting is fantastic, especially during the chess games.The show is a limited series and I think it makes it even stronger! I really enjoy this format and would like to see more of those.So, if you are bored by the usual good but mediocre shows, try this one!",10
"How rare that we get to see such a beautiful and flawed woman conquering a foreign land where men traditionally rule. She's a badass and her natural intelligence is her superpower. Great acting, casting, direction and script.",10
"I was always drawn to series or documentaries about chess as I find this world absolutely well.. out of it. People playing this sport are not wired like us mere mortals. So I started to watch the first episode and binged the whole season of course. The 60s' allowed fantastic sets and wardrobes and I loved it (reminded me of the sets of Mrs Maisel). Beth is a complex character. She's cold and warm at the same time. She shows no mercy during tournaments but she's sensitive (and a bit awkward) after the match.
I thoroughly enjoyed it.",9
"The filming, the directing, the acting, the character development-everything is done so flawlessly to make this show one of the best of the year.Each character is charismatic in their own unique way, and every character gets an ample amount of screen time. Beth's mother is played to perfection and provides some comedic and tragic story elements.I came into the show knowing nothing about chess and find myself now wanting to join a club. I wouldn't be surprised to see this show rake in the awards.",9
"What an amazing serie! The whole story is just marvelous. The acting is flawless. I don't even play chess, though I've found myself totally immersed in it. The plot is extremely interesting and exciting. I simply love it.",10
Very promising show. Perfect tempo. Interesting story.,9
"I have no idea how to play chess. Yet this series woke more emotions in me than anything I have watched in a very long time has.It is the kind of show that drag you into the universe, make you feel like you're the characters' friend, and give you an empty feeling when the ending comes. My throat was hurting from crying over poor Mr. Shaibel, and my heart was beating faster than Beth and Benny's speed chess games. The series did a really good job of conveying what was happening in the chess games to a non-chess player, without ever over-explaining, simplifying the rules or repeating itself. Considering how many games of chess were played in those seven episodes, it is very impressive not to repeat the same way of showing a game.I have been deeply moved by the complex personalities of Beth Harmon and everyone she meets. So glad I randomly clicked this on Netflix. I didn't even know it was about chess when I started watching.",10
"I love chess movies and shows. Whenever I find one I have to watch it.I had never heard of this show/novel until I saw it advertised on Netflix. Anya Taylor-Joy is remarkable! The scenes are stunning! Supporting cast and characters could stand to have a little back ground, but still mildly interesting.",9
I loved this series. The little girls Beth and Jolene are great and the adult Beth is amazing. Great sets great music great story and great acting. I've already recommended this to everyone. Really worth watching and a great finale!,10
"Just amazing,we need to have more of this series everything is awsome,the events the actors, if you're desperate and feeling demotivated,watch the serie and live in a world of hope and determination,Thank you all for producing this wonderful piece of art ??",10
Nothing more to say about this series but outstanding. Watched it in one sitting and enjoyed every minute. The lead actress was superb. Well worth the watch.,10
This series is about Beth Harmon a young girl orphaned at the age of 9 that discovers she has an amazing talent for chess. The series starts with her as a young girl in the orphanage and she gets taught by a janitor to play chess. As we see her grow up she is played by actress Anya Taylor Jo she gets adopted by a couple at age 13 and then starts entering chess tournaments. She is now invited into a whole new world. The acting in this series is amazing the lead actress as Beth Harmon has so much complexity and demensions to her character. There are some other interesting characters she meets along the way as she starts winning tournaments and gaining fame. Her character is also self destructive taking pills and washing them down with alcohol. Some of the chess playing scenes are thrilling and you dont have to be a huge fan of chess to enjoy them. I loved the costumes in the series set in the 1960s and the cinematography was great as well as been very well written. I really enjoyed this series.,10
"Everything in this series is well developed and played. The character development, the dialogue, the scenes, the acting and the music, making it the perfect series for this year. I believe this is the best series ever produced by Netflix so far. It is almost flawless. You will enjoy every bit.",10
This miniseries manages to transform the intellectual and slow pace of chess into a very exciting sport. I will admit to being hesitant to watch this because I never found chess that captivating - boy was I wrong! Anya Taylor-Joy was perfectly cast in the lead role. She absolutely embraced the character and you don't doubt for a second that she's a world renowned chess prodigy.All seven episodes offer character development that blend seemlessly into the wider plot. There's really never a dull moment in the series.I just can't get over how great Anya was in this. She had the perfect look for the historical time period the show was set in.If you're considering watching this but worry watching the game of chess won't be entertaining - just do it. I promise you won't regret it!,9
"You know that smooth, ""lose yourself in the moment and surrender to storytelling"" kind of feeling? That's where I found myself with ""The Queen's Gambit."" This is a story that has waited years to make it to any screen. It is well worth the wait. The story telling is straightforward, hard, and crisp. Characters are portrayed without predictable cliche. I love it when it seems there was a flawless dance between casting, writing, director, and actors. The slowly building crescendo is satisfying. This is one Netflix truly got right! I will be bitterly disillusioned if it is not recognized in awards season.",10
This show didn't once take my attention away I started it a day ago and now I am finished I loved it and got excited on the last episode such a good find,10
"Well played indeed. The cinematography, score, and of course, that beautiful redhead. Chess players and geeks alike triumph in this epic battle of nature, nurture, and most importantly choice. Well played!!",10
"Superb and quite entertaining. They managed to capture excitement of the game. Highly recommend!
Suggest also The Opera Game movie, on the life of Paul Morphy.",10
"It has some dark spots and sometimes hard to follow as the timelines change sporadically, but despite the main actress not being a super likable person, you are pulling for her the whole way. I didn't really like that it credited drug use as being such a major factor in her enlightenment and success. It does illustrate that drug usage can seem glamorous or beneficial initially but the risk is that it can and usually does take over your life. It was very well acted, and the story was entertaining, I very much enjoyed it.",9
"A beautiful story easy to get hooked. Good acting, great costume and a beautiful end.
A must see!!!!",10
"I've watched a lot of shows, but this is truly a masterpiece. Saw one trailer for it and I was immediately drawn in, but that was nothing in comparison to how compelling this show is. Not ashamed to say that I binge watched it all in one day, and it was worth it. The cinematography was amazing and the screenplay is equally as good, but the acting is, by far, the best part about this show. Anya Taylor-Joy like her character truly is the best at what she does, but even with the other actors, I couldn't find one instance where the acting was anything but mesmerising.",10
"Is a very good movie, excellent production. Very realistic chess movie.",10
Who would have thought that this series about Chess would be so thrilling. Everything about this series is very entertaining. Don't miss it!,10
"My wife insisted that we watch this, and we just finished the first episode. Already, I can't stand it, and there's no way I'm going to watch another one. My younger son played chess for several years, so I have nothing against chess. But this is so excruciatingly BORING, not to mention depressing. If it was actually a true story, it might be necessary o suffering thru stuff like this, but it's pure fiction, so there's no excuse.",1
Just finished The Queen's Gambit and have to say it may be the best miniseries Netflix has made to date. I have always liked movies about Chess and this series is up there with the best of them. A must watch whether you like chess or not.,10
This little series was absolutely amazing. What an engaging and raw story told so beautifully. Such an amazing cast. Overall the most well produced Netflix original I have seen. 100% give it a watch,10
"Chess games are really exciting, as is the evolution of the protagonist and her conflicts.
The color palette, costumes and everything related to aesthetics in this series is brilliant. Like the music.
The casting is very good, especially Anya Taylor Joy who shines as Beth. Even if you don't understand any chess, you will understand the whole game thanks to their expressions. With this series she became one of my favorite actresses.
In my opinion the only problem I see is that sometimes it gets a bit tedious and predictable.",10
Anya performance amazing. The acting is great in general.Great production.I've started chess lessons.,10
"""Anya, chess, 60's and intelligence"" these four favorite aspects come to one perfect reason why i should be thankful with 2020.Inspired me to come back to play chess since hiatus for a while. Special spotlight to Anya Taylor-Joy, she'll be forever in my heart as always. Well done.",10
One of the best actresses of this generation can make any type of character simply the best series of this 2020,9
"Amazing show, great story, great acting.
Beautiful Anya will win an Oscar one day and won't take long.
Watch it now.",10
"Such a joy to watch, listen to, look at and relate to. Everyone in some way thinks they are good at chess. Its a wonderful look at the chess world while living a life. I had to look up that this was not a real story. Either way - what a story told in a book then put on screen with, actors, writing, directing, costume and set design coming together so amazingly!! Thank you. X",9
"The top notch production quality resembles that of HBO's Chernobyl and True detective.. with this show, Netflix has reserved the next Emmy for ""outstanding limited series drama""..",10
"Where shall I start?First the lead actor of course, she is mesmerising, hard to take your eyes off her. She brought the quirky, intelligent, independent beauty to life. Love the choice of fashion and music.I honestly did not expect a story about chess playing would be so engaging, its pace feels optimal throughout the season. The series entices with dramatic turns, and yet allows enough space to appreciate the details - artistic settings, the performances of a talented cast, and the dialogues.Everything is crafted with care and delivered with poise.",10
"This hooked me from the start and didn't let go. Anya Taylor Joy is magnetic and the supporting cast are great as well. It truly is a show that sucks you in and doesn't let go. The finale was one of the best I've ever seen and ties up everything perfectly.Also, the aesthetic of the 60s is captured magnificently by the production designers and recall contribute to both the character of Beh and the overall feel of the show.Go watch this, you won't regret it",10
"One of the best mini series ever made, an absolute joy to watch",9
It's a two hour movie stretched over to seven hours with unsubstantial repetitive lines and prolonged staring. Yet another flat Netflix show that says nothing.,5
Captivating from the first moment. incredible depth of story without any stupid tricks.,9
"Barely know the game, but found this series riveting. Extremely well made, you wonder how a staid game can build up so much excitement. Chess is the protagonist, the dramatics personae are the players and the director is the grand master. One of the best tv series ever.",10
"There has not been such a well told story of this type since 'Patch Adams'. everything was done perfectly. I'm not one for binge watching shows I've already watched, but this one I want too",10
What a series I was hooked from the first episode. So much more to this series than a game of chess definitely one to watch again,10
"I never write any reviews, but this series is a wonder!!! Simply brilliant, in very few occasions can one say the story, the characters, the costume and production design, visual effects and music ... everything comes together beautifully serving this masterpiece of a show.
Hats off to everyone who worked on this ... you must all be very very proud. ?????? ????",10
"Absolutely wonderful, everything is beautiful. Casting is magnificent (I loved all of the characters), cinematography is splendid, fashion is incredible. I have played chess my whole life and aside from Beth's repetitive openings..... it has definitely made me want to play more. Thank you for a great series.",10
"And i had the feeling that i was watching a huge movie, not a series. One of the best series i've ever watched, and no ...it was not a post-apocalyptic series.",9
"Is the kind of series that you wanna finish in a day.i cried and I lived every second like I was there.every one of elizabeths feeling.
I will love to see more series like this.
I can't describe in words the whole feelings but I absolutely love it and I loved all the characters. Well done 10/10",10
"Anya Taylor-Joy is just beautiful and brilliant in the role, the cinematography is great and the sorry is really captivating.",10
"Who would have thought that blow by blow action sequences on a chessboard could rival the great classics of sporting hero films.Who ever took the risk of producing this script deserves a handshake. Books are not easy to turn into motion picture but what has resulted is a compelling story with complex characters that brings you straight into every next episode.Watching someone be the best version of themselves is very satisfying, but being the best at anything is something that dreams are made of. Inspiration flows dramatically through the season with a supernatural plot device that causes us to have a strong emotional connection with the protagonist.I was weary of the usual artistic trope of a religious orphanage being cruel and over-bearing but this is not what happened, the showrunner is to be thanked for resisting that temptation.The attention to detail between French and Russian culture latter in the season was amazing, combined with a heavenly score it makes us all wonder why this series has not been pushed and promoted heavily.",9
"Pure 10.
Very very good mini series. I recommend it.",10
"Real, melancholically uplifting. I was doubtful on the first episode, but I am glad I went and watched further. Simply a masterpiece.",10
"When Netflix make mistakes you get Another Life and Rebecca.....and when they are on top of their game they buy The Expanse, make Stranger Things and The Queen's Gambit!
Whoever picked this book up and decided to pitch the idea to them is a genius. There was nothing about it I didn't like - the direction was flawless, the cinematography a delight and Isla Johnston, as the young Beth Harmon, and Anya Taylor-Joy are a credit to their craft. I even had tears in my eyes as I watched the last episode. Part social commentary on 60s small town America, as well as breaking into the male dominated world of chess while battling your inner demons, I loved it. I loved everything about it! And the playing out of the chess moves on the ceiling was what CGI was made for!
Take note Netflix - please try and pick better projects like this instead of making films that were executed far better by a past master....",10
This series has no low points or boring episodes. It starts on a high note stays on a high note and ends on a high note. This series is an absolute masterpiece.,10
"I can't say I've enjoyed it as much. Although it's exceedingly long, it's not the production or casting (both are particularly good); it is the story. Beth character is nothing but a cheesy mixture of Czentovic and Dr. B. from the 1941 masterpiece 'Chess Novelle' (Chess Story or The Royal Game) by Stefan Zweig. Unfortunately, Tevis's story has too many loopholes which makes this whole thing nothing but another superhero action.",6
"It has its many obvious strong points, but I can't go above an 8/10 for several reasons:1. most of it - with the exception of the last episode - is oddly devoid of emotional content and leaves various event sequences without on-screen closure2. the focal ""achievement"" is a grossly overrated board game that correlates neither with general intelligence nor with any other type of socially relevant skill that might make good players worthy of the kind of respect that is traditionally awarded high-performing chess players3. it's the same old Netflix style liberal-progressive message that all we need for equality between the genders is for a few exceptional women here and there to become ""successful"" in some previously male-dominated highly individualistic, highly competitive and hierarchical field, never mind how hollow or meaningless that field was to begin with or how dehumanizing and repetitive (or antisocial or violent, in the case of CEOs or military achievement) the work required to get there. This is a pathetic shadow of what feminism should be from a genuine Leftist perspective (but comes as no surprise when the source are Liberals, who are right-wing).There are good messages thrown in there, it's certainly satisfying to see a woman beat so many men at a competitive activity, but it also leaves a lot to be desired. (""For All Mankind"", for example, is a much better recent feminist TV show set in the same era.)",7
This show is a masterpiece..do yourself a favour and watch it right now..,10
"This series turns out be 2020's true winner. Truly an exemplary series showcasing one of the oldest and most intellectual games in our history and the show truly pays an homage to this breathtaking game. Most of us have grown up on chess, moving pawns across the board or watching Gary Kasparov and Vishwanathan Anand, but a little girl taking center stage in a male dominated game while conquering her vices makes this show's each scene worthy of view time. The passion displayed by the main character for the sport where you can see her whole world revolving around it inspires you to find your own and stick with it. The innocence of the young girl yet with no fear in her mind despite her adversities and intimidating circumstances, truly dominated the show just like her plays and leaves us with a few lessons to take.A girl born an orphan finds her family in her friends, opponents, supporters and she finally learns to accept that she doesn't need to remain one. A truly well etched out character with a brilliant actress carrying this mega series to it's finesse. I love chess and show is an absolute personal favorite. Go girl!",9
"What an amazing tv serie! Exceptional the lead actress, loved montage, directing everything. Yes netflix makes exceptional tv series. 10/10",10
"They mix good between comedy, depth with ease and a lot of sudden wisdoms.",10
"I was both, and the character and I came of age at the same time. What a difference 50 years makes!See the movie. You will thank me.",9
I know this doesn't qualify as a helpful review of the series (which is by all standards great in my opinion) but it just occurred to me that Beth probably is the dream woman of all nerds (at least the ones I know) ^^ just needed to get this out of my head. Have fun watching everyone!,10
"Not only a great story with great actors, this series captures the time through automobiles of the 50s and 60s and also the clothes, interiors of stores, houses and hotels. The character of Beth Harmon is so believable as a child and adult that she grabs your attention from the beginning. We watched the series over four nights; two each of the first three nights and the last episode on the fourth night. Just sorry that it did not run longer. A real treat. Do watch!",10
"This show has everything...! Great characters, story, 60s set pieces, the acting and directing is quality. You gotta love a well made period piece that is well paced, even though each episode is long, and you can't wait to see what unfolds in the next episode. It's based off a 1980s book of the same name, and both actresses that play the lead really nail their work. The actress that plays the young Beth early in the series set in the orphanage, is such a talent she sets up the story well as it jumps ahead in time to her teenage years. It was a very original and interesting story line, and importantly, engaging... The process the main character uses to learn and develop her Chess game was entertaining from the outset, and continues to be explored as the story develops beyond the orphanage. Well worth a view.",8
"Interesting and well made throughout. The later half had some slower moments, but overall the the series was better written and shot than most i see. Felt realistic and had no glaring cliches. The music was incredible. Might be a masterpiece and the lack of the last star might be my preferences showing. Overall i loved it.",9
"Hands down one of the best series I've ever watched.
Well written, well acted and the music score is on point.
True to its time of the 60s, the story is told so well.",10
"It was a bit predictable, but still a great series that surprised me, felt more like a movie though the hours melted together.",10
"I'm not going to give a long review for this. This mini-series deserves better than my words could ever describe. I started this late at night, and finished it the next morning. The acting was impeccable. The story was captivating. It wasn't your typical chess presentation. I encourage anyone to watch this. It will inspire you.",10
"Strange how movies on sports perceived to be ""boring"" turn out to be a lot more riveting than those made on football, tennis or cricket -- case in point: 'The Queen's Gambit' (chess) & 'The Greatest Game Ever Played (Golf).",10
"Normally I'd never post a review. But in this case I must. This was simply awesome from start to finish. The atmosphere, the performance by the actors, the suspense and above all they story line. Well done to everyone involved.A truly classy production with a story to boot. I'm immensely intrigued and entertained. For the last two episodes I even shed a tear or two and I never, ever do that. What a performance by Anya Taylor-Joy!",10
"Brilliant acting, cinematography, soundtrack, wardrobe and above all directing.
A class act of a series that is absolutely spellbinding, from its spectacular leading lady to the storytelling that completely sucks you in.
Some of the camera work in this was just phenomenal.
If I were to recommend a must watch series this would be one of them.",10
"Finished this series within 2 days and was gripping from the start. An emotional story about how a female is dominant in a 'mans' game of chess. Although I myself am not that interested in the game, I was enticed to see how the main character played and would progress and learn throughout her life.The sets were amazing, especially due to the series being set in the 1950s-60s and captured each country beautifully. Alongside the character arcs all which had a purpose and were well casted.This series reminded me of The Crown of which is another very high rating.Would definitely recommend this show to anyone!",10
"Everything. The actors, the scenery, the scenes, the makeup, the decoration, the design, the filming, the acting... all was perfect.
It was short, attractice, long episods!
Very well directed.
Loved it so much.
We are thrilled to such high quality content.",10
"A great story, great acting, pacing was right on the money and a very satifsfying ending. They knocked it out of the park. Who thought a chess story would be so good. I will remember this show for a long, long time. It was a a story first and chess match second. NF couldn't have done better.",9
"Don't find the words to express! What an outstanding acting (by everyone), settings and story. So glad I watched it - maybe the most artistical show I have ever seen...",10
"I liked this. I enjoyed the acting and characters. I wasn't sure about casting Thomas Brodie-Sangster as Benny, but he eventually grew on me. I couldn't really give it a higher rating because it was just too predictable.It's nice to see chess get more mainstream recognition.",7
"This is a high quality series, no doubt. After watching it I feel respectful of the creators. To me it's like a piece of art, a dark and beautiful fairytale with great ambience. The costumes, the music, the scenography, and the great actors. I love the 60's setting and the theme of a young girl excelling in a world of men. Somehow though, while the beginning was captivating and the actress portraying the young Elizabeth very acomplished, I found the middle somewhat lenghty and repetetive. I'm sure chess is exciting, but there is a Lot of playing to be watched over and over. It perhaps would have been more interesting to further explore the emotions, motives and relationships surrounding the main character. Or just cut it down a few episodes shorter. A mini series to me, as marketed by netflix, shouldn't be longer than 3-4 episodes. However, the ""endgame"" leaves me with chills and tearful eyes, impressed overall.",8
"Never could imagine that a TV show about chess would have me on the edge of my seat the entire time, beautifully done and astonishing performance by Anya!",10
"I played a little chess as a kid in a local chess club but was never enthralled with the game, or even any good. Now, many years on at 59 years old, this truly remarkable work of art was provided me a glimpse of the totally engaging addiction that the game can be for some. I binge-watched the series and there is not a single thing that I can criticise, although I am a self-admitted picky, pedantic, grumpy old codger. It is no exaggeration to say that this is one of the finest, near perfectly-crafted pieces of film making that I have ever enjoyed. I recommend it without reservation for anyone who enjoys fine film making and great acting.",9
This is Netflix's best limited series of all-time. It is brilliantly well done.,10
"Watch it, it is very good.
EXCEPT, the addiction part is treated more like an aesthetic and less like a profound issue that ruins lives.",8
"Easily a binge-worthy series.
The acting is stellar by everyone.
Writing, directing, costumes, styling, cinematography is beautiful.Anya Taylor is wildly spectacular in this role. She is mesmerizing, calculating, and enigmatic.",10
"Hats off to the writers, actor! Love how you brought beauty to the journey of becoming a master!",9
The story is about a Chess prodigy. But the best part is even if you don't understand Chess this series will transpire you to that world where Chess is a passion and battle of minds . Anya Taylor Joy is outstanding. She is the reason you must watch it. Apart from Anya; the whole team deserves a round of applause for creating an excellent series about Life. It's struggle and the triumph. Feel Good.,8
"The best thing Netflix has come out with in a while. It watched a lot like a movie, and I'm really wishing it wasn't a limited series.",10
"What very well done movie. Ms. Joy is an amazing actor, beautiful too !",10
"I'm not often enthralled, but this story did exactly that. Enough complexity to keep the scholar in me engaged, while containing enough heart and tension to keep my emotions on a rollercoaster. Seldom, since ""Roots"", has a mini-series moved me as much as this did. The character depictions by the cast were all they should have been and more. Anya was stunning, both in depth and camera-magnetics. She really commanded all the scenes and her wins and losses, highs and lows, affect the viewer viscerally. Seriously... Enjoy this story. Well-written... superbly acted... totally engaging. I'd have given it eleven stars, if I could have,",10
"The character development and the premise of the show is great but they don't even show the board during the chess matches. As a chess player myself, it's kind of like a football movie that doesn't actually show the football game, they just show the final play and expect everyone to know what lead up to it. How do we know that that winning towchdown will win the game? We have 2 players facing off in a match but you only see the individual pieces as they play. They should show the actual game of chess as in the entire board. It's kind of hard to build the drama of the match when you can't actually see the pieces in play.",7
"This series is the best thing to happen to Netflix. We'll written, amazing cast and every attention to detail is perfect. A must watch.",10
Good for the uninitiated non-chessplayer revolving totally around a prodigy; a totally interesting and absorbing story. Anya Taylor-Joy and Thomas BrodieSangster deserve recognition for their artistic performances.,7
AMAZING !!!!! BEST SHOW EVER ON NETFLIX !!!! THIS SHOW NEEDS TO WIN A FEW AWARDS. ACTING WAS SPOT ON. Anya Taylor-Joy IS NOW ONE OF MY FAVORITE ACTORS.,10
With Netflix trying to push there diversity in films this gem is one well balanced serie. The story line is far out of standard for most drama shows. Overall a series you will binge in one night,10
"It's a beautiful, vibrant and interesting drama. Great story, incredible acting, excellent camera work and special effects. I never imagined that the world of chess could be shown so dramatic, and so exciting. It was a great pleasure to watch the first 6 episodes. Alas, the last episode 7 added a fair amount of tar, too much to my taste. Dear creators, this is not how the Soviet Union looked like in 1968. This is not Moscow, the street traffic never goes on through the Red Square and the Kremlin wall is not as long as the whole city center, and children didn't serve at hotel restaurants, what a nonsense! And why everything is so dark? The last episode filled with strange speculations and fantasies of the creators of the series. It looks more like a silly video clip or of the 80s ""Russian loves the children too"". Maybe this was the point? Doubtful. Realizing that the whole story is completely fictional, it would be nice to shoot the whole film (especially at its climax) that is realistic in every background detail - this would help to create an aura of reality of what is happening, a parallel universe. It would make a viewer to believe that this is actually happened. Unfortunately, the fake and grotesque pictures passing off as the Soviet Union, on the contrary, emphasized the unrealism of the story and crossed out everything that has been so dramatized in the first 6 episodes. It is very sad, all that was needed was to watch a few hours of newsreels and do a very basic research. It looks like Netflix has not yet matured into a real deep movie production just yet.",10
"If this show doesn't win any awards, then nothing else deserves it.
One of the best series I've seen, had to push myself to go to bed rather than stay up all night.",10
"I never like giving reviews much, but i gotta say it's one of the best i have seen so far...",10
"Like all the frames, strong storytelling and beautiful colors and lights through the film.",9
"This is an amazing serie. I enjoyed everything. The pace, the storyline, the acting. I think this is one of the best",10
"One of the best series of 2020.
You don't need to know anything about chess to enjoy it.",10
"Amazing!
Anya Taylor-Joy - I fell in love with her, she plays just amazing
Filmed masterpiece, music is beautiful, acting gorgeous!
Everything is at the highest level, you just have to see it",10
"Before watching this masterpiece i just wanted to see the trailer but i accidentally pressed the play button and i found myself watching the whole episode all i can say is You have to watch it , i watch all the episodes in one day !! The best Netflix series of 2020 by far",10
"This is a good show. It is not perfect, it could have been made better, for example adding visual aids to chess moves to make it more comprehensible to non players. I still give it a ten, because here we get an unusual hero. Not loud, not even smiling, rather solitary with her inner universe made of chess moves and pieces. I find her agreeable. Intelligent instead of arrogant and mostly quiet, using her brain instead of talking. Exploring life her own way. I have had girlfriends, mostly artists, that are similarly interesting because they do not limit life to social and mundane things only. I do not like chess, (not chess specifically, rather games in general). So I am more interested in the passion and dedication as well as substance use / abuse and their effects on cognitive performance. The main actress is weird looking with her eyes farther away than usual. She is cute but she looks strange. She does a very good job at moving pieces on the board, so she had to learn moves instead of dialogue lines I suppose and she looks very realistic although I wonder what real chess players would say. Anyway, this is refreshing.",10
"Granted I have not read the book but after reading some reviews I thought why not as this seems to be well received.
I couldn't agree more. The acting and story is well played out and the character development is so much that I really did get absorbed into the whole story line. Time well spent for me. 9 stars.",9
"I'm more of a sci-fi guy actually, but this show had me captivated all the way through. I really enjoyed it and I even had to shed a tear at the end. So I would definitely recommend this show to anyone. Chess players and orphans will binge.The story is about Beth Harmon who grew up in an orphanage and turns out to be a chess prodigy. The rest... is for you to find out.One might think that a series about chess must be a bit boring. Quite the opposite. The chess matches are pure excitement. And besides chess there are all the other storylines that form the this perfectly dosed drama.. And form Beth's personality.I particularly liked the character of Beth, a smart and solitary girl, sometimes lost in her own world. Sometimes lost in the real world, trying to find out what life is about.Great score, beautiful cinematography, 60's fashion, edgy cliffhangers, and... which I find nice: it is neatly wrapped up after 7 episodes. If only Netflix would produce more of this one-season-shows.A chess quote to end:
""I am convinced, the way one plays chess always reflects the player's personality. If something defines his character, then it will also define his way of playing."" - Vladimir Kramnik",9
This is one of the best series I've seen...ever. Couldn't recommend it more.,10
"So , folks, after i ( a goodish chess player ) got sucked in the third episode , around two o clock at night, there come my wife awake an sit next to me , start watching , and at the end of the binge , me going to sleep, she stayed back to catch up the missing ones.
Conclusion : the best show .
Netflix deserves a gong for only thinking to make this show.
The rest, as they say , it's history . Or better , it will be written in the history .
A real gem , congratulations to all involved.",10
"I could never imagine a film about chess could be so engaging. From a very well laid out story, deep and truthful character development, and fabulous scenery of the 60s, to astonishing acting by the main cast, ingenious editing and wonderful soundtrack, these mini-series are an absolute masterpiece.",10
"This mini series is so refreshingly good. Many great series/movie kind of butcher the ending or make the ending sad/depressing, however, this one although wasn't mind blowing, was perfect. Throughout the episodes, this series had kept me intrigued and invested in the character development. Like the chess that Beth played, no blunders, strong development, and a bit of intuition and finesse, this series had done the same. Just amazing!! This should definitely be up for multiple awards. A must watch!",9
"I had just about given up on Netflix. Too much wokeness these days and everything that trots out the stable doors always seems be agressively pushing an identity politics agenda. This show is a study in how you *should* approach topics such as feminism, sexism and other 'ism's, because it does it in a way that integrates into the story and adds to it, rather than detracting from it in the usual in-your-face fashion that is popular these days.As a chess player myself and a fan of the whole child prodigy trope as a whole, I started the first episode not really expecting much (Netflix?), although the ensemble class should have clued me in that was likely to be above average. Anya Taylor-Joy is a superb actress, as evidenced in some of her previous work, but the question was, would the script, direction and cinematography allow her to shine? The answer, thankfully was a resounding yes. The supporting cast aren't slouches either and it was an odd moment for me seeing Sam from Love Actually playing her antagonist/frenemy with such panache.I binge watched the entire 7 episodes and have the lack of sleep to prove it. Following Beth's life, from precocious troubled child, through awkward genius teen to brilliant adult was compelling viewing and I imagine lots can relate to her journey, warts and all, albeit without the added baggage of being a virtuoso at competitive Chess.The final episode had me fist pumping and yelling in glee and the wife wondering wth was going on upstairs. There's one sequence, during the final match with her chess nemesis, where her opponent makes a move that had not was completely unanticipated. Beth, initially thrown for a loop, takes a deep breath and even though I knew what was coming next, I was still yelling at the tv, ""look up Beth! LOOK UP!"". Look up she does and she manages to employ her trademark visualisation technique to wargame the rest of the match, something up till that point she had relied on drugs and alcohol to achieve.This 50 year old man hasn't been so engaged since Captain America smacked Thanos around with Mjolnir in Endgame.The series, while not completely without flaws, is a revelation and not to be missed. I foresee more than few awards in the near future and the cast and director should likely start clearing some shelf space now. Anya in particular is amazing. Absolutely superb.",9
You just can't stop to watch. Great story!! Masterpiece of 2020.,10
Really good series - highly captivating storytelling,10
"I didn't think a series about chess would be this intriguing and thrilling. I don't play chess and now I want to. Anya Taylor gave a performance of a lifetime and she's simply one of the best 'prodigy' around now. The series is very well made. The cinematogrophy, music, costume design standout, of course along with the writing and direction. Netflix is on a roll lately and I hope they take up more like these.",10
This show is remarkable. Anya is an amazing actress. Watch it. Not start at night ??,10
"Amazing series, this will remain one of the best series on Netflix forever. Scot Frank you delivered a masterpiece.",9
"Nothing in this miniseries has a flaw. Rarely have I seen such quality in every aspect. Acting, cast, script, directing, lighting, design - the whole package was absolutely perfect.
The original writer, Walter Tevis, wrote a highly unusual story, and they made into an absolute masterpiece. That's very rare.
I hope the makers of ""The Queens Gambit"" remake ""The Man Who Fell to Earth"" - although exceeding David Bowie's acting will not be an easy task.",10
"Seven episodes were a bit push. It might have been shot for only five episodes. But overall, it was outstanding.",9
One of the best TV shows ever made and first time for me that I wanted to start watch again just after I finished.,10
"Everything was excellently done. The novel by by Walter Tevis was amazing. The creators: Scott Frank, Allan Scott were brilliant. All the actors were great but I fell in love with Anya Taylor-Joy. They call it a TV Mini-Series but to me it was just a movie which I hoped would never end. I certainly would like to see more such ""movies"". This is truly great cinematography.Brilliant!!!!!!!!",10
"My 11 year old digs cheese. Saw the preview for this while surfing Netflix for something to watch. Checked IMDB...8.9? That's tough to maintain, but at 20k+ ratings, perhaps it's true.Seven hours later, at 3am, we both agreed. This miniseries is an easy 10 across the board. Story, writing, acting, cinematography; all top notch.",10
"Well, I wasn't expecting that kind of serie. From the story to character development; it was very satisfying to watch. Personal dilemma of Beth and relationship with other people felt like she was a real person. Side characters also had that kind of depth so I was nearly convinced myself ""this person could be a real person"". Also show is not trying to sell a political view to its audience and it's perfect. Have some transitional mistakes and object based errors but it's okay.",9
"I was so pleasantly surprised by this series for a Netflix Production. Good performances, good plot, everything great! Anya Taylor-Joy shines through the camera and does an excellent job. Such a nice story to follow..I binged watched it in a day with no regrets. Definitely recommend watching this!",8
"I usually don't watch Netflix series because they have a simple and cliche storyline and the actors are terrible. This series is one of it's kind. It is about an orphan girl that has been through a lot not even understanding why and how. The storyline is very powerful and inspiring - highlighting love, success, friendship. I especially loved the last scene where she started shaking hands and playing with Russians (or beyond) showing that chess is a different universe, away from political dirt. I highly recommend others this series and I am very happy that it ended how it ended. Not a single episode or season is needed. It was all complete.",10
"I had only watched the very first 6 min. and 04 seconds. First impressions: Poor acting by ALL who managed to appear in the first 6 min 04 seconds. Unrealistic scenes start at 3.33 and culminate, for me, at 6:04 with cursing and ALL characters acting unnaturally, even weird even for an orphanage. So, I'll pass these series. I have zero tolerance for bad acting. Not sure why so many has rated it so high. I did rate ""Rita"" high if you want to compare. Why would actors ""live"" in their roles in Rita and fake their characters in these series, is beyond me.",1
"For sheer entertainment value this scores highly. I binge watched this up until the last episode and then watched that two days later. Something I frequently do with a captivating series to let it settle before letting it unveil itself.I enjoyed Anya Taylor-Joy's character Beth and her unusual looks carried me even further into her world. Her subtle almost expressionless face and the way she reacted to situations was mesmerising and almost autistic even if there was a misstep between child and adult. ATJ carried the series with confidence and ability beyond her years. I wonder if anyone else noticed the clumpy stiff backed model walk to emphasise her confidence.You were left in no doubt as to the era from the rose tinted glass American 1960s to the cold western version of the Russian 1960s and this did at times feel distracting. Along with styling AJT after Audrey Hepburn. Stunning to look at but a little mismatched with the Beth character who showed no interest in fashion at the beginning and suddenly bloomed. Picky really but it did feel a little Mad Men.I wish they had explored the financial side of it a little more. Beth paid the mortgage and then bought the house for $7000. She proceeded to lock herself away and glamorise drinking to excess without explaining where the money to live and pay the mortgage came from. So some thought on what the prize money for playing chess would have been might have helped sell it a little better. The living standards between Beth and the Benny character, who beat her and should have had more winnings seemed at odds.Finally, the downs weren't low enough or convincing enough to raise the highs where they were needed. It seemed too predictable at times and the ending was a forgone conclusion and played out that way. She didn't struggle with much and her addictions were cast aside as easily - drinking and tranquilisers were a major addiction and presented in a positive way mostly which may have been a little tone deaf today, but then this is entertainment.Room for improvement and this is offered as critique not criticism. As my title suggests this is head and shoulders above much of the drivel available right now and should stand the test of time. I hope there is no second series, that would dilute the first season and be an obvious money grabbing decision.8 - I thoroughly enjoyed it.",8
I never binged tv show in my life. Let alone on something coming from Netflix which is usually horrible. Did not expect this at all! This hit me hard. On so many levels. Pure bliss!!,10
"An interesting series with unusual characters but I'm puzzled by the anti-Christian message. I know it's seen to be cool to be anti Christian but it really isn't.
The main point is that this bit of the series is not relevant to anything, someone has just stuck it in because they think it's trendy or something. It's unfair and unpleasant.",5
"This was a unique experience that literally forces the viewer all at once, non-stop. Amazing cast,amazing acting, awesome picture and direction, it takes you back to the 60's, it makes you love and respect chess and gives another , sympathetic view to all these geniuses around us.... So happy to find this gem. Just watch it",10
"This is the best show I have seen on Netflix and I am no stooge for the production company.Great script, wonderful cast, really good acting and direction, with excellent production values.You don't have to be a chess player to enjoy this show and don't be put off if you think it will be highbrow - it's a character-driven piece with compulsion/addiction at the core of the story. If you enjoy quality drama then I thoroughly recommend this show.",9
"It all started when I was trying to put my baby to sleep, around 7:25 pm.I was browsing Netflix like we all do and I saw this new addition. Usually it takes about 10-20 min for my boy to fall asleep so I said to give it a try.I went to sleep in the morning.Like someone said in earlier comments, do not start this at night.",10
After the firts episode i was planing to wach the firts episode for the second season of the Mandalorian instead i devour the hole series in less than 10 hours. Best series that I've seen in 2020 and the last couples of years.,10
"Chess isn't the most exciting thing so it shows how great the writing is to keep you riveted to the screen. Finally a series that depends on the writing and acting and not on graphic murder, sex and explosions to keep the viewers attention.
Seriously, if you want something different this is top notch.",10
"The story is an amazingly written , performed and shot gem. Didn't make me doubt a second about the story's authenticity. It rides a fine line of what you'd think chess tournaments would be and being edgy enough to keep you watching. Opens a new world through the eyes and life of genius Liz Harmon.I truly applaud and can't thank enough the person who decided to use russian actors. The accents were on point. You did your job right.Another person who did their job was the set designer. Retro 60s show ? Sign me up!Made me interested in chess! Go watch it!",9
"Oh my God, what a trip and what emotions! I'm a player and i am crazy about Chess but this movie took me from the heights to the deepest emotions. I loved the characters, Harmon and Schriebel, I adore them! Congratulations for a such a good movie!",10
"I'm not a chess fan and am even less inspired to play now, I never knew about the strategies. The story itself, is beautifully told and wonderfully acted by all the cast. Stunning performances from the characters Beth and Jolene. A refreshing change of topic for a movie. You need to watch it.",10
"Gripping story, outstanding performances, and greatly shot. 7 episodes just enough to tell a good story to entertain you. Now I'm going to go play some chess.",10
"Chess. Amazing depth.
Addiction. Amazing psychology
Award winning performance.",9
"What a remarkable series infused with intellectual wording, visual extravagance and, pieced together like a riddle.Do not take into account the fact that its based on chess games. Rather, focus on the wholesomeness that it brings with the era of the 60s. We have the time where stimulants were a big hit in society. The integration of ethnicity/race into the workforce based on quota. The exploitation of alcohol and drugs. The increase of females in the male dominant areas: medical field, professional sports, criminal justice, advertising reps, etc. And lets not forget all the emotions you'll feel, the inspiration you'll get, and the undeniable love you will resonate for the main character and her development.""I read about this pop artist once--bought an original drawing by Michelangelo; when he got it home, he took a piece of art gum, and just... erased it... leaving nothing but a blank page."" The Queen's Gambit",10
"I know nothing about chess, but I can appreciate great acting and storyline, and this was riveting! I went through a whole range of emotions watching this, several times yelling at the screen...this one should not be missed!",10
"Such a gripping story, amazing direction and cinematography. The series will generate lot of interest in the great game of Chess. Exceptional+brilliant!!",10
"The overall aesthetic of this show is outstanding. I love the dresses and the location of the scenes. To be honest, I wasn't really expecting anything from this show but I ended up binge watching it. If you like the aesthetic of the show ""marvelous mrs. Maisel"" then I think you'll definitely love this. Its predictable but in a way, it still makes you intrigued.",8
"Saw it twice.
Anya's acting on this show is amazing, you can see every aspect of the character.The production was precise with the smallest details.
I think that The building of the characters and the story line is perfect.",10
"What I first expected to be a real-life story, disappointingly was just another feminist propaganda movie series based on a novel, well-played, beautifully coated, entertaining, moving but cheap. Still, all in all it deserves 8 stars. I liked it! Don't miss it! Watch it!",9
"This show exactly gave me what i wanted. I started watching it agter 5 seconds of watching the trailer and binge watched it,finished it in a night. I love how the characters are shown,i kove how the story was built up. It was so thrilling yet full of sorrow. It made me feel like a proud mom but also so lost. The plot was amazing. It also is appealing to me because i enjoy ""smart,intelligent,powerful"" characters in series so Beth was the perfect character for my taste.This is my favorite so far,it gave me every aspect i wanted from a series.",10
"I love how the series show the protagonist and her stepmother support each other. Also the relationships between her and the male characters. Not just sexual relationships, but also friends.",7
"For whom didn't know chess at all, I still addicted to this drama. Beth Harmon casted by Anya did an excellent job to show Beth's cleverness and characters. I think if you know the chess can understand the narrates and totally found it more interesting. The grow up path of Beth I think not many of us would understand as long as you are also a genuine. It's not lonely in her case.",7
"Definitely superb production quality and great acting. I can say enjoyed watching it but I could have enjoyed it much more if a deeper character written for Beth. First problem is quite obvious, storyline is so predictable and it's a huge problem against feeling the excitement. Second problem is actually related to first one ; Beth is unnecessarily perfect. It reminds me that saying ""You can't win'em all"".Who doesn't like geniuses? I love Rainman, Amadeus and other well-made movies about remarkable people. As for Beth, she's very smart, beautiful, sexy, fairly sociable along with her genius. The problem is she doesn't have enough weak points so you can relate to them. I wouldn't expect an autistic character of course yet needed more obstacles in her life to add some excitement to the story. She's been portrayed way too perfect because of strong woman concept, even her alcohol and drug problem went away without seeking any rehab or professional help made things really unrealistic. I guess being a female chess player or being an orphan is not good enough for drama. Eventually it becomes boring time to time seeing Beth is shining all the time. Of course a nice ending always makes you forget the hiccups in the journey.Also kudos to Netflix. Finally they're coming with some worthy content on their diversity and social commentary angle. I'd say it's a nice piece on feminism although I don't appreciate it becomes a movie more about feminism than chess in general. But I consider this a good step on finding the middle ground.",8
"By far one of the most thrilling and emotional TV shows of 2020 and on netlifx to date. I stumbled upon this by acciedent and immedietly got caught in the rich story and life like realtiy of the show, the emotion portrayed by each actor and actress is astonishing. There are so many moments where i literally lept out of my seat from excitment and had to rewind and watch the scene a few more times just for the thrill of it, the challenges that Elizabeth faces throughout hrer upbringing and adulthood are all so relatble to many and easily percievable that ist allows the audince to truley connect and feel whaat each character is feeling. I can honeslty say that I dont regret watching this entire season in one day because I dont think I could live with no knowing who the world champion is. Ten out of ten would recommend.",10
"Amazing find and a stand out title among a growing overload.
Me and my wife we glued to the coach while watching the limited series in 3 sessions. What a great story of an orphan to world champion in what is a fascinating game.
Loved the lead actress and the other characters and how the story unfolded to a foreseeable but still wonderful climax.",10
"Netflix have been on a downwards spiral of late but The Queens Gambit proves once again they have the class to produce some of the best TV drama out there. This show is a much watch, regardless if you know the rules to chess or not. The themes of addition and loss are brilliantly executed!",10
"A patient, intelligent, and strategic series; just like Chess. Well done, well done!",10
"Utter garbage. Nothing to do with the real chess world, just playing on your emotions.",1
"I didn't sleep last night because of this show
just amazing",10
"I must say, The Queen's Gambit is the best series that netflix has ever made! The story, the actors, the cinematography just wow I'm blown away. Anya Joy Taylor is a great actress, the way she potrays Beth as someone that is genius but also troublesome at the same time is so believable, she's for sure is the next big thing... and Thomas Brodie-Sangster just made the whole thing shape into perfection. They both have very strong chemistry and I love and I would beg to see more of them. Please if you hesitate to watch this series bcs you have zero knowledge about chess like me, you know what just wacth it! You won't regret it, I promise you this series worth every second of it.",10
This is best series I have ever seen. everything was perfect. epically there accuracy on chessboard! I watched many chess related Movie/series where Board pieces are wrongly placed... but is this series everything was perfect also acting was very good!,10
"So pleasant lead role and so fantastic was the whole series. Suppose everyone can't leave it aside. The last episode kept me guessing until the end, because I assumed all her friends became KGB agents and their goal was to spoil Harmon's game against Borgov. However, it happened other way around and I'm very happy that it was so.
Netflix did an extremely good job!",10
"Wonderfully engrossing and entertaining. The main character, despite being sullen on most scenes, is very likable and brings the viewer on a journey of all the highs and lows.While it may seem that it is about feminine strength, the series accomplished the feat of not overcompensating and making feminism an agenda. It is solely about her rise and stumbles as a chess player.Interestingly, the negative reviews on this page bear no sense on the series but are about their own religious extremism. While another must have been doing housework instead of watching an episode.Highly recommended. Captivating story and superbly performed by the main actor. Side note: costumes are wonderful.",10
"Really amazing writing acting and music, its rare but sometimes TV shows get everything right, best show I'v seen since Chernoby, perfectly donel! 10/10",10
"The series was just marvelously done! Without a doubt, it was the BEST series I've watched for a long time (and trust me, I watch a lot of series). Here are the points that made it so exceptional:The costumes were just on point!The music was exciting and beautiful at the same time.The plot was absolutely not cliché, and kept me interested all along.Finally, this genius woman chess player was not an ugly nerd with glasses like we are used to in movies.Watch it and you will love it ;)",10
"Absolutely loved this.
I'm working on a theory that each of the characters represents a piece on the board.
Beth-Queen
Borgov-King
Townes and Watts - Knights
Matt and Mike-Rooks
Beltick and Jolene-Bishops
Shaibel- The pawn",9
"Wonderful story, I loved each character, casting made this series even more special...perfectly casted, directed, location/sets, costumes, everything. Well done, thank you, I loved it.",10
"I've never been mesmerized by any series like this one. All I want you to know is, watch this series. The cinematography, the storyline, the acting, the actress and actors chosen to portray the characters are the best. Don't wait no more; watch them today.",10
"Amazing immaculate performance of Anya. Her beauty is breathtaking. The camerawork is art. I fell in love with the clothes, designs and all actors next to Anya. Just an incredible show done the right way. Wish they would do more quality shows then so many trash.",10
"The high ratings are understandable as it's more of a political series than a series on chess, they have literally not left any stone unturned when it comes to social justice. Feminism, inclusion of other race, anti communism, atheism over Christianity and so on, everything that is deemed cool these days. While I do support these ideals, I would just say there are better ways and works in which these ideals have been portrayed in the past. This series just came across as some sort of propaganda.Purely from chess aspect, this show does not come across as well researched yes there are some beautiful combinations of winning a chess game, but overall it what they have shown doesn't come across as realistic, even the greatest chess players of all time have a 60% win percentage in classical chess while she literally always wins. The entire series is she playing a game and somehow winning in the end.Moreover there are many factual inaccuracies like a guy mentioning that in a perfect game of chess white has a winning advantage because it moves first and then he mentions the same is the case in tic tac toe, that's just plain stupid both games when played optimally ends in a draw. And even beginner level board game player knows that.If you love the political angle of this then go ahead and watch this, but if you are watching it for chess then you would be disappointed and might find few of the sequences cringeworthy. You can rather watch a documentary on Bobby Fischer on whose life this series seems to be inspired from.",4
"This limited series is one of the best I've ever seen. Acting, cinematography, writing is all top notch. I binged this in less than a day. Watch this and enjoy the ride. A beautiful, well told story.",10
"After long time good show from Netflix.. Interesting story, era and perfect acting performing. Just one thing make me laugh, the outfit and style of Thomas Brodie-Sangster. He looks like a student from elementary school who wanna be interesting man like Indiana Jones or some explorer... With that a teen boy mustache he was really ridiculous",8
"The series lacks in the only two things that made me wait so long for the episodes:
It doesn't look like Tim Burton is behind it and it doesn't even look like it's from The Addams Family...
The protagonist is contradicted by other characters and all of this doesn't make her the Wednesday we know.What turns out, unfortunately, is just a teen drama/mystery that's still entertaining, I'll admit.The technical level isn't bad either, the Cgi a bit poor but not in all the scenes.But from a series on Wednesday Addams with Tim Burton directing and producing I would have expected more. What a great pity.",6
"Have only seen the first episode but am aware of misintepretation here!The show is called WEDNESDAY for a reason - it's the adventures of Wednesday as she navigates unfamiliar territory. It's a character study with some appearances of the rest of the family. If, as some reviewers, you turn up expecting a straight reboot of the 60s sitcom, you'll be disappointed. However, the show seems lovely and Ortega, Christie, and Myers are excellent, there are some wonderful recurring and guest stars and one very delightful blast from the past on the cast.Also, shout out to the cast and crew - I knew you filmed this during a tought period in Eastern Europe when the war in the Ukraine broke out.",7
"I was expecting a lot, and I got what I wanted.Tim Burton and The Addams Family are two universes that fit so well together.The whole vibes of this show were just amazing, keeping the whole Addams Family style but also making us discover a whole new original scenario, with the Nevermore Adademy. (I don't care anymore about my Hogwarts letter, just bring me to this academy!!!!)
The actors were perfect, Jenna Ortega was MADE for this role (speaking of actors, I feel the need to remind you that Gomez is inspired from the first original cartoons by Charles Addams, not the Gomez you're used to), having Christina Ricci in this show was also a very nice idea!!And of course, Tim Burton couldn't have made a real comeback without Danny Elfman!! The music was fabulous. Just the main intro music is so epic, I could listen in in a loop for hours!So yeah, as a huge huge fan of The Addams Family, I must say, I LOVE this show.And I'm definitely gonna watch it more than one time in my life.",9
"Directed by Tim Burton... Music by Danny Elfan... The look of the frame, the acting and story all remind me of the two now classic 90s Adam's Family Feature Films... Wednesday was my favourite character in the films, especially the second one when she and Pugsley got sent to Summer Camp...Christina Ricci in those films as Wednesday was floorless, and it was great to see her appear in this too. Ortega's turn as the main character was excellent she is quickly becoming a great actress. I think you need to give the series time to develop and remember that it's target audience is quite wide, I don't think it's meant to be too dark. Just like the 90s films it plays on the dark and morbid humour, but with the teen angst mixed in.Definitely worth watching if you are intrigued, but remember that it's not an 18+ rated adult only tale... it's a modern tale on these ever classic characters, think along the lines of the Netflix Sabrina series... If you liked that, then this should be right up your alley.",8
Honestly the show is amazing! Definitely little mad that Wednesday and Clair didn't get together but that's more of a me thing! The show itself has amazing actor's and jenna ortega played Wensday perfectly. But if you're expecting anything like the original Addams family your just not gonna get that. This is more of a tribute to the series with the most notably different being Morticia. However this show is absolutely worth the watch their is so much passion in every second of this show with so many twists and turns and laughs. We get to see a new side to Wensday never touched on before as she's now a teen and her dark humor is just awesome. I highly recommend watching or giving it a shot!,9
"I think the whole premise of this project was interesting from the start. A modernized and focused spin-off of a decades-old gothic sitcom? Sure, let's give it a try.Without any real spoilers, the premise of the show is Wednesday Adams being forced to sign up for a boarding school for monsters. The plot is essentially a watered down monster harem anime meets Scooby Doo. A mystery is set up and it's explored with some average quality writing.There are a handful of spot on gags that genuinely made me smile, they are the exception rather than the norm, but they were still good enough to be memorable. Detracting from the well done jokes are a few pretty annoying identity politics references that are out of place enough to stick out oddly. Keep politics out of entertainment please.So far, I would have probably given the show a mediocre 4 stars due to very uneven writing. However, Jenna Ortega absolutely, positively, amazingly grabs the screen. She portrays her character excellently, delivers the humor, and happens to be a very beautiful person. She is everything good about this show and grabs the screen so well that she makes an otherwise mediocre Netflix show worth watching.Writing, plot, pacing: 4/10
Jenna Ortega 10/10
Overall score: 6/10.",6
"What a let down this is. I really craved for another movie or series similar to 1990' s movies with Angelica Huston. I waited for this series, so excited, and it turn out to be a Harry Potter wannabe. The original movies worked because all other people were normal and the Addams were the creepy ones, and this huge difference between them made it funny and cringe. No humor here only tired lines, now she has paranormal visions, she goes to a school with vampires and mermaids and other things... is a cross between Sabrina and Harry Potter, no Tim Burton atmosphere, just disappointing and boring. Maybe will appeal to a younger audience who doesn't know the originals, but for an older audience who grew up with the real deal this is just pointless.",3
"#SixSeasonsAndAMovie please!Netflix, pick this series up for more episodes because holy cow, you hit it out of the park this time.Ortega is PERFECT as Wednesday, I loved her in X and I love her in this.The title says it all: WEDNESDAY! This is her picture, her character always steals the scenes both on the small screen and in the Tim Burton films, this series time jumps us to her late teens and hits the ground running with mysteries, adventure, and spooky macabre humor.Tim Burton directs the first four episodes, and the score is by Danny Elfman!I am enamored with this series and can't wait for it to get picked up for more seasons, and the potential spin offs of the other lesser featured (this is Wednesday's show of focus, after all) should get fans hyped for an eventual Addams cinematic universe using this cast. The casting is perfect across the board, and I love Christna Ricci's character, such a sweet nod to the OG!",10
"When I first saw the trailer I was very excited to watch it. But now I don't think I can even finish it!It isn't a bad series it's just does make me go 'I wonder what will happens next' or 'omg!! I need to see more'The first episode was okay but it just got worse over time, don't think I can make it past episode 3. It just seems like a glorified cw show. It's dull and boring, just doesn't have the same vibe as the last Addams family movies.I don't think it is the actors/actress that is the issue, I personally think it is the way it was written, if it was written differently then I don't think it would be to bad. CGI was okay but you could definitely see when they start to use it.So unless you like the last few seasons of riverdale then you might like this series too.",5
"It was very difficult to continue watching past first episode, but I'm a hopeless optimist and apparently a masochist. I'm nothing short of devastated by what writers did to Addams family's legacy in this series. Wednesday is mean, bratty and malicious, in oppose to true Wednesday Addams who is collected, stoic and morbit. True Addams family is about love. This show's Addams family is about distrust, suppression and conformity. I really don't want to use that descriptor, but... This show is disgusting! I and all of my friends are disappointed. Casting and some of camera work at least is great.",1
"So overall I think the show is quite enjoyable, Wednesday was portrayed very well by Jenna Ortega and the plot was generally alright. However, the romance in this show is atrocious. Like it is out of place and completely cringy, I had to look away sometimes because the second hand embarrassment got too much whew. The two guys who are supposedly Wednesdays love interests are literally so bland and unlikable wow, Xavier is the average, snobby edgelord and Tyler is super annoying and thinks he's special because he's not scared of Wednesday. He's so pick me, choose me, love me like god go away. Enids case is almost worse cause she has a completely random crush on Ajax, who's literally even more boring than the other two, like i can't list a single character trait for him and also the audacity of him to be mad at Enid for going to the dance with someone else, while he does the exact same and not even telling Enid why he couldn't make it to the date like shut up bro literally get lost in the woods what an unnecessary character. He drags Enids character down. Bianca was a great character, should've gotten more screentime, she has lots of potential which was unfortunately ignored in favor of stupid ""romance"" and bland characters nobody asked for. Yoko was there for like 10 seconds, which is weird cause she was promoted quite a bit and we just never saw her or heard her talk except for like 2 times. Eugene was cute, only likeable male character, he's just chilling, love his dynamic with Wednesday. The rest of the Addams family were great to watch, the principal and the teacher were also nice characters. CGI was uhh interesting but i don't care much for it so it didn't bother me. Biggest issue is really just the romance and some of the characters. Wednesday and Enid had a scene at the end of the last episode that put all the romance scenes to shame, because these two literally have the best chemistry in the whole show. I would watch a second season only for Wednesday, Enid and Bianca tbh. Well and Yoko but the team doesn't seem to care much for her character.",6
"Another Netflix let down I have seen this show before and it was called Sabrina the teenage witch. This is geared to that same group teenage girls. Now I understand a show about Wednesday would have some of the teen angst and ""finding"" themselves but this tips right on over to a CW series. Did Tim Burton get gentrified? It sure seems like it. There is none of the character he usually brings to his projects. I think I really realized what it was when half way through first episode she runs into three ""normal"" boys who immediately try to beat this little girl up but of course she has her ninja moves and defeats them. This is the SECOND time she is attacked by a group of normal (they even tried some diversity with a black guy ringleader) teen age boys in the first 30 min of the first episode. There are bits to this that could have been fun or interesting Gwendolyn Christie is wildly under used. Catherine zeta-jones will never be mistaken for angelica Houston. I thought the Gomez casting was interesting as it did seem to be a closer match to the original comics. But again no one can touch Raoul Julia. I can see already where this series is going and I think it will be another that will flame out quickly for netflix.",6
"I was expecting something so different from what i watched. Since the first appearance of the Adams Family in 1938 there have been at least 10 different actresses that have played the death obsessed 13 year old. But in my opinion there has never been one better than Christina Ricci... until Jenna Ortega.This young actress is absolutely fabulous as Wednesday Friday Adams. The facial expressions, the attitude everything screams Wednesday Adams.I found myself intrigued and mesmerised by the series and watched the 8 episodes in one day. Every episode has it's own intrigue and yet they fit together perfectly.Though C. Zeta-Jones as Morticia Adams and Luis Guzmán as Gomez Adams are not my favourite actors for their perspective roles you get used to them as the episodes go.A great series to watch in the dark.",9
"As a child I liked the Addams Family. This cartoon series later on got filmed. That didn't quite get me. Then the trailer of Wednesday showed up and I was intruiged: images seemed nice, directed by Tim Burton (love his work) and so far the series seemed promising for me.I love the contrasts they use! It has Tim Burton written all over it. But the acting is at a childs level. The scripts are simple and therefore there is no depth in the characters. The CGI is quite disappointing from time to time, especially for these times. But worst of all: in essence it is just another high school love/hate/misfits/need-to-belong story.I would recommend watching the old skool Addams Family cartoon series instead.",4
"I will start to say , the actors is very good , however all the characters were well rounded and played well.I really Loved it. Adult humor. Dark
The start is less intriguing at first, but once you get going you're hooked very quick! The plot is super fun to watch; a mystery mixed in with teenage drama (of course). The mystery aspect is really riveting, and I was guessing along the whole time to try and solve it myself. Overall, this show was amazing!Netflix are killing it this day , first 1899 , now this.What a big win for Netflix.Definitely Would recommend both shows .And enough of the nonsense hate.",10
"Unfortunately I really don't like teen dramas. But of course knowing the concept before starting to watch, I had to prepare myself for a few obnoxious teens.The Addams Family (including the extended family) should be the only weirdos in the room if you ask me.To set this in a school with other freaks is a disappointing twist on the classic formula, and I find myself missing the fact that she wont be surprising other characters with her strangeness, because after all everyone's strange in some way. I takes the sting out of the essence of being an Addams.I can't recognise any of Tim Burtons usual flavour either. So there is more to be disappointed about there.I'm pleased to see Gwendoline, Catherine, and Christina. Jenna is good too.But I'm not really feeling it unfortunately.",4
"Right from the outset it's just awful, Pugsley is a wimp bullied in school and crying? Wednesday is ""plagued"" with visions, sorry this would be a good thing to her not a bad thing that's the whole point in the Adams family. The entire cast is off awful acting very flat like they are reading from a script. Both Gomez and Morticia look like a really really bad cos play of the cartoon version.... very strained, unfunny and boring so far away from the original material. Will have to go and watch the originals, even the full motion animations where better than this!Just awful and that's before you get through the first episode of the season!",1
"I loved this series. Jenna Ortega as Wednesday Addams was truly a match made in heaven. Pairing her alongside the character of Enid was a fantastic choice by the directors considering how their scenes together really stole the show. We got to dive into the backstory of the Addams family a little bit which I LOVED. Morticia and Gomez were amazing and I loved their characterization. Don't even get me started on Pugsley. He was such a sweet boy and an excellent (and refreshing) take on the character. Enid Sinclair surprised me with how much I grew to love her. Jenna and Emma's characters were an absolute blast to watch on screen. I wasn't too interested in the love triangle. It was strenuous and bland and left me feeling bad for Wednesday. However, I can definitely seen potential in Wednesday and Enid becoming something more. Their chemistry had me laughing and crying (especially at the end). Overall, this was an amazing show. It exceeded all of my expectations. My only hope is that for future seasons (please Netflix give me more) for the CGI to be more fleshed out. However, the CGI never once took away from the story or characters. NETFLIX GIVE US A SEASON 2!!!!!!",10
"I don't think it captures the Addams family spirit entirely, but it's still a great show! I absolutely loved it and watched it all in one sitting. I wasn't sure about the casting at first, and I still don't think they're as good as previous actors, who held the roles, but they still do a great job.This rendition of Wednesday shows a bit more feeling than I had expected, wich threw me off at first, but it ended up working out well with the story.The plot and the atmosphere overall is excellent, it is dark, twisted, and comical. On top of that, it was great to watch a show in wich the ending wasn't painfully obvious right from the start. They threw in some nice twists and turns.",9
"Tim Burton's Wednesday is pure dark magic, and it's fantastic to watch. - Yes, I'm actually quoting another franchise, but it has to be said: ""I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it. Just a very entertaining watch buoyed by an incredibly magnetic performance by Jenna Ortega ... mark my words this girl is the future of Hollywood. While the show may not appeal to all, it's witty script and compelling mysteries should boost Netflix's 'Wednesday' to potentially becoming a cult classic. Without a doubt one of the best things Netflix has released in a while.Definitely recommend.",10
"Wednesday has the toxic and acidic humor of the adams family, the wonderful performance of jenna ortega, great soundtrack and the perfect aesthetic of tim burton. There are some things adapted for the current teenager to enjoy, but it's very subtle and just right, loving it .I really don't know how there's a lot of people said the acting is not good , I really thought that the actors and the acting is perfect.I enjoyed every part of the s series, and I was shocked when I saw it I didn't expect that good quality of production and amazing visual and great vibes .And we don't forget the fantasy elementary was very good .10/10.",10
"I love the show in general. Jenna Ortega did an amazing job on making her Wednesday intimidating, scary and adore at the same time. My only advice would be that she talked a bit too fast. What was great about Christina Ricci's Wednesday was that she talked more slowly and it really makes her Wednesday more scary. However, Jenna's Wednesday glare definitely beats Christina's Wednesday glare.The setting was great too, perfectly captured what you would expect in the Addam's Family universe and how you would expect Wednesday to behave when she is with other girls her age. I do hope this show can get more seasons and more mysteries.",9
"I don't usually make reviews, part of the reason is that i'm bad at it.But the last time i was so hooked on a Netflix series was Arcane and i felt like it was due, taking all 8 episodes in one go.No doubt that Jenna Ortega carries the show, but the show is supposed to be about Wednesday, so that is not necessarily a bad thing.This show won't be for everyone, especially fans of the original Addams Family universe, but for anyone who is just expecting an entertaining show, with a sprinkle of mystery and melancholic feel over it, then you'll enjoy it.Looking forward to a possible season 2.",10
"This is a great show and Jenna Ortega does a great job. However, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Luis Guzman are absolutely TERRIBLE. CZJ is bad but Luis is just awful. Both are playing the characters poorly.However, the rest of the cast is exceptional and the storylines are entertaining. I just cringe every time Zeta-Jones and Guzman appear. These are are the only mistakes Burton made in casting.I know there are some complaints that Burton's hand isn't really apparent here but it shouldn't matter. He did a good job with Wednesday and updated the family to the 21st century.CGI is lacking in some scenes but nothing too terrible.",8
"Wednesday is not herself.They ruined her... and not in good way.They've dictated it's okay to say the B word and other bad words, but Wednesday can be
""the Horrible Mean, Boss, little girl. Instead she's saying please and thanking you, begging for boys and other. I mean come on, they ruined the whole point of Wednesday... The animated Addams family, had much better impression of Wednesday. It seams like Netflix it's just going through this weird face of school, teens, girls drama. Like the school good and evil... I couldn't even make it to 3eps without being disappointed of how ironic Wednesday is..",2
"I like it but then I think it should be so much more.The casting of Wednesday is perfect, don't like the casting of morticia and Gomez at all.Tim burton directed this and all I will say is anyone could have directed this, what happened to burton? He has lost his style everything since he did sweeney Todd has been lacking in dark imagination. I liked the 1st episode and will give the rest a go. The girl who plays Wednesday is excellent in the role, not pining for Christina ricci, who is in this btw. However Angelica Houston truly made morticia something unique and natural, Catherine zeta jones looks like she is filled with Botox and makeup, this Gomez does not have the dastardly charm or good looks of the Gomez from the movie. Let's see. First thoughts. Will continue watching.",6
"I hit the 10 before the titles - totally hooked from the first shot of Wednesday. It looks fabulous, plus Tim Burton has been responsible for many of my favourite films. The feel is exactly as it should be. It's Wednesday, it works without the comedy of all the proceeding versions of the Addamses. It occurs to me that those that love the Addams family are drawn to the dark deadpan delivery, not really needing the funny. As a coffee drinker from infancy, I love that Wednesday's coffee order is the same as mine (4 shot espresso). End of the episode and it's still a 10. The whole cast has the odd surprise, but they work so well. CZJ as Morticia - a big surprise, I'd not looked up the cast in advance. The first scene with her in the car - that ""I know I know you, but who are you"" feeling...... I remember her fro The Darling Buds of May back in 1991. On to episode 2 ..... still a 10 and plus an ""Ohh!"" ..... I have to go now and watch this a few times. This is good!",10
"Just binged the first 5 episodes day 1 and had to force myself away. A great reinvention of the character in a unique modern world crafted by the likes of Tim Burton and Danny Elfman with the modern Scream Queen Jenna Ortega at the lead.It was a fresh new take on wildly beloved character I love the fact that it stayed true to the original story however, it gave new life to Wednesday and a NEW storyline. It's not a reimagining of The Addams Family, it is truly Wednesday's story!! The school, the cast and the plot are absolutely delightful. Tim Burton is a genius and I am 100% ready for a season 2.",10
"It's a teen mystery drama, that uses words like ""mansplain"", ""gender neutral"", ""patriarchy"", ""female objectification"" way too often to enjoy the story. What happened to Tim Burton, the man who brought us many masterpieces? Is it another proof that Netflix can ruin everything?Also, apart from black hair, this new Wednesday has nothing to do with the old one, although Ortega plays well. I'm in the middle of episode 4 and I'm not sure if I want to continue watching. I don't think I'm the target audience, which is a shame because I enjoyed the old movies very much. I'm happy to see Christina Ricci, the original Wednesday.",3
"""The Addams Family"" films are among my all-time favourites, and I had high hopes for this series considering Tim Burton is again in the directing role. But to my surprise almost every aspect of this series is simply wrong.One main problem here is the core concept. The Addams family is supposed to be a eccentric or weird family, and the main conflict in their stories -as well as one of the main sources of comedy- comes from the conflict between this family and the ""normal world"" that surrounds them. But in this series Wednesday goes to a school for misfits with supernatural powers, among which we can find vampires and werewolves. They seem much more dangerous and even more interesting than Wednesday. So anything special about the character is simply gone out the window from the start. What could possibly be interesting about Wednesday, if she's surrounded by actual monsters? She's just a girl who says creepy things. Strangely, characters around her still act like they're scared of her, which makes no sense whatsoever. Shouldn't they be more scared of the actual vampires and werewolves in the school?Another big problem is the casting. I can't imagine for a second that Catherine Zeta-Jones (Morticia) and Luis Guzmán (Gomez) are a couple. And apparently they neither, because they don't seem eager to touch each other. Pugsley doesn't look like Pugsley. Uncle Fester doesn't look like Uncle Fester. Every character seems off. And the title character most than anyone. Jenna Ortega has a ""sexy latina"" look that certainly doesn't match the Wednesday Addams style. Characters around her call her ""pale"", but she seems to have a healthy tan. Shouldn't a teenage Wednesday look like a stereotypical gothic girl? Is that so difficult to do? Also, for someone who is pretending to be a cold, unexpressive killer, Jenna Ortega seems too emotional. It's the most unconvincing character, probably because it's the one with the most screen time.Another worrying aspect is the comedy. ""The Addams family"" films had great jokes, which still make me laugh despite having seen them 100 times. And dark comedy provides so many opportunities... But in ""Wednesday"", most jokes don't land. And in some cases, they were so bad that they made me wonder if they were actual jokes. I've seen bad comedies, but I've never seen a comedy so bad that I'm even unsure if they're trying to make me laugh. It's perplexing.But the most unforgivable of all these sins is not understanding the characters and what made The Addams Family great. It was the story of a family that, despite having very odd members, loved each other and cared for each other. ""Wednesday"" fails miserably at that. The first things we learn about the title character is that she seems to hate her parents and despise her brother. She doesn't love anyone, so why should we love her?",1
"Update: OK - my initial review was too harsh because I hoped it was going to be a show based on the work of Charles Addams. If you accept it is another YA teen drama with an outcast kid at it's centre it's more watchable. It's just not the Addam's Family really.At the core of Charles Addams creation was love and familial solidarity: that is abandoned here and replaced by a thoroughly unpleasant, self-absorbed bratty teenager being vile to everyone but especially her mother. I don't think this is ""updating"" the story but completely undermining what we loved about it to begin with. She doesn't seem sassy or funny just rude. The Addams's were always scrupulously polite - even to their enemies - it added to the humour and showed how classy they were, yet Wednesday is yet to offer a civil word to anyone. The success of any show depends to some extent on our identification and sympathy with it's central character but there is nothing at all so far to make you care in the slightest what Wednesday does next. I'm watching it a few minutes at a time and it's hard work.",5
"From the first line... to the last!The series is amazing....
I finished in one day...
The story is amazing with the effects every episode is more and more great...
On the other hand the music is so colerful that's get it to the next level!About the cast...
Genna is incredible at her role.... i really enjoy her.Tim Burton makes wonders in the 4 episode that he directed... and what more can you ask when he have Danny to the music....
A Gothic storyline that make me clapping my fingers all the time and talking to the screen like a crazy teenage girl...
Yes I was amazed and I can't wait for the next season....",10
"I was so excited for this as the Addams Family was my favorite growing up, especially Wednesday. This show lacks so much of her. She usually talks slow and mannered, she doesn't get scared of things, i feel like she never felt as an outcast in a negative way. She did show some great addams skills like martial arts, arrow, swords but I expected something else. I feel the show did not get her essence. Her way of presenting and speaking well. This feels like they used the Addams name for another Netflix teenage drama. The Addams family is very special through their quirkiness which lacks here so much.",5
"Just watched all 8 episodes with 2 of my grandchildren (girl 9, boy 10). They loved it and we enjoyed all of it, from the music to the direction. I love Tim Burton, he did himself well in this movie. Both grandchildren had seen the Addams 1 and 2 before. I highly recommend this movie for 7 and up, some scenes were a but scary. They loved seeing Thing, but he was all scared up and no reason given. The actress who played Wednesday was perfect in the role. The school looked like the Addams family house. I think one of the best part of the movie was Tim Burton kept changing the bad guys to the good guys.",10
"This show is brilliant and what's great about this world is the amount of characters and types of ""monster"" you can give attention to, plus there's more that can be done with the family etc. There feels like endless potential and possibilities for this show which is really exciting.The humour is on point, it has loads of fun little Easter eggs, I loved the 2 movies and the 2 animated ones, I was worried when I saw this was being made as Wednesday was my favourite growing up as Ricci had a star making performance as her. I was confused at the casting but Miss ortega is phenomenal, her eyes and mannerisms are perfect! You can see exactly what she's trying to get across easily!The show flies by, effortlessly entertaining, beautiful world has been crafted and it's just a genuinely witty, unique experience which is a breathe of fresh air. Whilst I prefer new content and ideas I don't mind seeing stuff like this when it's done so well.There's only 2 negatives, I felt Wednesday softened too early but completely understood story wise why she needed to. The other one is the casting of Gomez, supposed to be handsome, charismatic but a bit daft, but this film and the animated 2 portray him as an unattractive guy with little presence or charisma! There was none ot the cliche Addams stuff between him and Tish. CZJ was a good choice but pugs, lurch and Gomez in my view should've been better.",10
"Jenna is perfect as Wednesday and she definitely did the heavy lifting in this show. She has the vibe, the face, the way that Wednesday talked and just is.Catherine Zeta Jones is also fabulous as Morticia, although Anjelica Houston portrayal is still my favourite. Mostly because I grew up with that Addams family movies. But both are fabulous. I adore them.Gomez is also good. Uncle Fester is perfect too and a nice addition. Pugsley is alright. There wasnt much screentime on the brother and I just found it bit weird that he was crying after being bullied and stuck inside a locker room. Thought thats like the perfect room for an Addam's family (considering that Wednesday loves to be in the Morgue's room).Story wise is intriguing for the first couple of episodes. Not sure if I really like all this high school drama mix but it is for younger audience + it is set in high school. The twist within the twist gets a bit too long, and I also thought they would do a call back to Christina Ricca but it went completely another way. But oh well.Just having Christina Ricca in the cast made me go super giddy already. Love her.Overall entertaining but I did fast forward a whole bunch towards the end of the season.",8
"Some people take pleasure in disgracing a modern day gothic classic such as this show Jenna Ortega shines as usual but still the small minded individuals who thinks so low of this show are just as Wednesday would say , Most people think I hate correcting criticism but I actually deep down enjoy and I even sent a thank you card and we all know how that turned out . Just a great show with a great lead and to the febal embryos who trash this show I wish you the best luck with your remaining brain cells .It's a great show Some great acting and chilling scenes Jenna Ortega is the star of course kinda predictable but just as morbid as I could have ever hoped for.",10
"The casting for his is so strange. CZJ is as gorgeous as ever, but fails to evoke the right Morticia vibes. Without the quirky mannerisms and innocently self-righteous tone, this Morticia is all dry and no quirk.Let's forget about Gomez going from half Latino to full, he now has a NewYoRican accent, has gained 100 lbs and lost all of his weird humor. Wednesday is doing what she can with this role-doing a good job with the dead-pan humorlessness Wednesday is defined by, but again, there is no underlying quirky juice to make her at all funny. She does things that are funny from time to time, but the jokes fall flat because her character delivers with a kind of anger that goes a little too deep.I think if you're not familiar with the original show, or the Sonnenfeld film, you probably won't mind all this, but for me, it's just not my cup of poison.",2
"I know I'm dating myself with this reference. But, in addition to the Addams family lineage, this show made me think of the cartoon Daria. Jenna Ortega as Wednesday is like Daria, if she was sometimes evil, and always Drop Dead Gorgeous. If I was 40 years younger, I'd camp outside of Jenna's house. The show is very well done, with lots of Star Power, as well. The revenge prank she pulls in the beginning sets the tone, which seems to be ""Don't mess with her, as you will surely regret it."" Catherine Zeta-Jones also shines as Morticia Addams. One question, however. How does Thing, a dis-embodied hand, see to get around? LOL.",8
"I have grown up with the addams family. Watched all the movies as well. Never ever was Gomez fat and an idiot. Gomez was always very charming, very clever and wonderful to listen to.Pugsly has always been a bit slow but never reduntant. I am so surprised this was directed by Tim Burton. It just felt Wednesday was forcing every word out of her mouth, keeping her chin down (idky they thought that would make it all look better?) she was so stuff and uptight it just felted highly scripted.As if no acting was taking place we were just watching a Wednesday robot. Perhaps Mr. Burton has never watched any Addams Family anything or at least that is how it seemed. I watched 35 min of it and disliked it very much. Christina Ricci was fabulous, Mortica not acting like Mortica and Gomez nowhere near what Gomez normally is.And HELLO Wednesday not liking Thing?? Threatening to hurt thing? Idk what is up with directors lately. It truly shows he never watched the show or he just wanted to ,""make it his"", which would be ridiculous.It seemed like they were trying to put ,""bits"" of fantasy in it yet failed on so m any levels. I would not recommend this movie to anyone and its so sad it has come to this rubbish. I rated 3 as I have always liked the Addams Family and also Christina Ricci, otherwise I would have rated lower.",3
"This show is targeting a very specific, slim demographic and we are not that demographic. We are not a teenage, Latinx girl who is an outcast that lives in a world filled with people that do not look or act like them. Is it the Addams Family? Not even close. This is not even a clever parody to the 1991 masterpiece film entitled The Addams Family directed by Barry Sonnenfeld which on a sidenote, is qualified as a one of the best Christmas movies ever! It would have been enjoyable to see Christina Ricci reprise her role as Wednesday but as an adult in the working world, cleverly dealing with Karens and Susans.",3
"It was watchable but I didn't love it.I'm not sure just how involved Burton actually was with this project, it doesn't feel like he was massively involved because this series really didn't scream ""Burton-esque"" to me. He supposedly directed the series, but a few different directors' names pop up in the credits?I was excited to see it when I found out Tim's name was attached to it, but it ended up being far too ""teeny high school drama"" for my liking.I did like Jenna Ortega as Wednesday, I thought she portrayed the character well and made it her own. Uncle Fester was okay as well. And Thing, but, ya know, he's a hand. The casting for the rest of the Addams however, I didn't like; they just didn't capture the essence of the characters in my eyes.This series had its moments, but as a whole I just didn't get what I was hoping for and was left a bit disappointed.",5
"I am so sorry for this. Tim Burton MUST direct all of the next. This was truly everything but the BEST episodes were from Tim Burton. Either way, it was a 10/10. I loved every aspect of it. Each director had their own vision. Tim Burton had the best in mine. I have never related to another character more than Wednesday. Amazing casting so kudos to the casting directors. Thank you for bringing a show that made me binge watch all day. I have not had this since Stranger Things. That was several years ago but I just have to reiterate that Tim Burton MUST MUST direct all of next season. HAPPY WATCHING YALL, you will not regret it.",10
"I went into this having not watched anything Addams since I was a kid, and with no expectations one way or the other. Wow, did this show amaze me! It doesn't overdo the teen drama, and it finds a great balance for humor in the morbidity.The story was surprisingly good, with plenty of twists and oodles of red herrings. With that said, it didn't push them to the point of brikg obnoxious, which was appreciated.The characters are well done with a solid cast (several great performances, especially by Ortega as Wednesday), and the show ended up having some real heart. It's not perfection, but it will hook you for one hell of a fun ride.",8
"If you are watching this expecting it to have anything in common with The Addams Family other than the name, you will be disappointed. Rather than being the odd, creepy, but loving daughter and sister of the TV show, comics and movies, Wednesday is an obnoxious, two dimensional, know it all pain in the rear. She has been turned into the stereotypical good at everything, smarter than the adults, ""strong"" female lead that Hollywood can't help churning out. Hopefully, the writers will add more depth to her character as the series goes on. Until them, the series is a disappointment to anyone familiar with the original Addams Family.",2
"Love the story. Love the mood. HATE, HATE, HATE Catherine Zeta Jones and Luis Guzman cast as two of the most Beloved Characters in TV history. Catherine Zeta Jones is too cheerful, round,
and well, she's just no Carolyn Jones. Luis Guzman? Are you flippin' kidding? No! Too fat. Too short. Too icky. Get over it Luis, you're a comedic actor! He's just no John Astin. LONG LIVE GOMEZ! Angelica Houston and Raul Julia were so much better as Morticia and Gomez. Still... not Carolyn Jones or John Astin but at least cast well. This is a prime example of just plain ole lazy casting. Could have been oh so much better with proper caring. IDIOTS!",8
"Couldn't even get past the first 10 minutes of the show. Seemingly the Addams Family is a perfect story for Tim Burton to remake given both his and the story's penchant for dark, whimsical humor. What's disappointing about this production is that it lacks both whimsy and humor. Where there was previously a loving family that couldn't find a place in ""acceptable society"" because they went against social norms, here we have an unoriginal story about an angsty teen that doesn't like their parents. I feel this lacks creativity or innovation to justify the time required to watch all episodes of the show.",3
"Barley survived first episode and will not continue. Main problem of this show is like with so many new shows today it just uses recognizable IP and first doesn't get it, and second it has people with no writing talent writing for it. They have no clue how to write Addams Family (in this case Wednesday) story to be creepy, funny or interesting so they just waste time on pointless things. Things happen, but most of them are just filler to fill the 1h mark. That makes this show extremely dragging and boring. Extremely bad TV. Wednesday motivation is silly, her dialogue is not smart and because of it not funny. Plot is disjointed and all over the place, some acting is really bad, some good, but it doesn't matter because what is written is of such low quality.",3
"I gave a lot of leeway to the show, when I watched the first two episodes but after having watched them all, I can honestly say...it's very basic teen drama with some magical creatures.A lot of the dialogue makes you cringe because 40+ years old people tried to copy teenager language of today. Constantly.The CGI looks low budget. I have seen better in movies from 20 years ago.You can see the plot twists coming like a street sign, telling you where the story will go in five episodes. There was a 20 minutes episode of ""The Fairly OddParents"", that basically had the same plot. But we have an 8 episode season here, folks. Almost an hour per episode. How?Yes, it probably is for a younger audience. Yes, it may be for teenage girls, who want to feel special because they are ""just like Wednesday"" but I honestly expected more than that. Especially because Tim Burton participated.",5
"I was blown completely away by this series! I've always been a fan of Wednesday, she is my spirit animal. But in this series? She's a beast! No other Wednesday could fight like this one!Also I love that Christina Ricci is in it as well, playing a teacher at Nevermore. She WAS my favorite Wednesday, but now she's number 2! Jenna Ortega owned that part! She was impressive! I couldn't get enough of her!!I gave it 10 stars because it exceeded my expectations. I didn't think they could replace Ricci as the best Wednesday and somehow they did amd it worked so well! The story was easy to follow and the characters were easy to love too. It all blended perfectly into 8 episodes and I hope there is a season 2 (fingers crossed)",10

Let's go!",10
"Just another average high school mystery drama. It was ok, just not very Addams family like. The show is about Wednesday going to a boarding school for outcasts and solving murders. The casting of Gomez, Morticia, and uncle Fester were horrible. Who ever cast them should be fired. They weren't in very much of it but they ruined what they were in. Gomez and Morticia were so normal: no passion, no intimacy, no romance, or weirdness. The show was predictable and cliche. Wednesday was ok but still not the Wednesday from the movies. And Pugsly was a total wimp. I almost stopped watching after the first episode, but wanted to give it a chance. ; I was disappointed. The show was only about Wednesday. The rest were in very little of it but they made it feel like I wasn't watching the Addams family.",3
"So I thought this was going to be God awful like most Netflix adaptations, but I found myself laughing and appreciating the camerawork, the clothes, the colors, the acting etc. The way everything is colorful and vibrant while Wednesday is just colorless and unemotional makes Wednesday stick out so much from being so out of place. You almost can feel how much she dislikes almost everything. She's smart, witty, and honestly kind of scary. Catherine Zeta Jones made me a believer in her from her performance. From start to finish this was a easy and fun watch. It almost flew by too fast and now I want more.",9
"It was better then i expected. This series is really awesome. It is so dark and funny at the same time. The acting of main characters is insane. I have watched the entire series in 1 night. Tim (Burton) has finally restored my faith in binge watching after so long. I couldn't put down the remote and was glued to the tv for 6 whole hours... What a magnificant transfirmation of our beloved charecters, as the lept off the screen and straight into our hearts. This was a jaw dropping thrilling TV show that i would recommend for anyone from the age of around 13 depending on how well you take gore. Will most definitely fined myself watching it again and given the ending I will have my fingers and toes crossed for a second season.",10
Yes... I know... it's not about the Adam's Family and I didnt expect it to be. It IS called Wednesday after all. But that doesn't excuse it from lacking that charm that made the movies so iconic. This really doesn't have much charm at all. I was REALLY looking forward to this as I LOVE all the Adam's family movies.... but I'm on Episode 4 and I am STRUGGLING to keep watching. It's a bit soapy for my tastes. There is very little comedy or anything worth a chuckle. The movie's were full of that. The higher production quality is keeping it above a CW series but just BARELY. And that makes me sad. I don't really understand how this has an 8.5 currently.... 3/10 is the best I can do and that is very generous. The essence of every character in this has been changed in including Wednesday. And what did they do to Puggsly? He is a cry baby wimp now. The more I reflect on what I have seen... the more I dislike it. I was going to finish watching it. But I think I am done with it. The only character true to the essence is.... Thing. And they even made him weird looking like a Frankenstein hand.,3
Jenna is really crushing it in the role of Wednesday. Every scene with her is just superb.Catherina Zeta Jones is okay as her mother but just misses something.I really don't like the character that potress Gomez but since the show is mostly about Wednesday at school the amount of screentime for both parents is minimal so it is not that big of a problem.Just wondering for future seasons if that is going to be a downside but we will see.The CGI could be a bit better so lets hope they have a bit more cash for it next season as that for me is the only real downside of the series and if CGI and cast would be a bit better it would easily get a 10 as the story is really good in my opinion.Shame we see so many series on Netflix with only 8 episodes while it makes binge watching a lot easier I do feel some things could be better if it has 10 episodes for example as sometimes thing go to quickly.,9
"Having looked forward to Wednesday for months, unfortunately it turned out to be a disappointment.The first few episodes were okay but further down the road Wednesday actually starts to get feelings.In my opinion Wednesday Addams should always be heartless like in previous black and white tv shows and like in the Addams movie cyclus.Dark, gloomy, black, rotten.... That is how the full show should have been. Instead, it was un-Tim Burton-esque... Too... ""Normy""...
Let's hope that in the second series mr. Burton does what he always did. Make it creepy, kooky, mysterious and spooky, strange, deranged.",6
"What... the...???I absolutely hate this incarnation of whatever this is trying to be.I loved the original TV series and the 2 movies from the 90s, but since then it constantly seems to fail and this show is no different.Poor Morticia is beautiful but married to a hideous filthy toothed crime of a man. Wednesday is... not delightfully weird, she's just abhorrent weird.The story line seems muddy, the characters don't seem to have any chemistry. I'm surprised that the OG Wednesday of our time Christina Ricci could even handle watching this train wreck happen. I'm sad that I don't love it like I hoped to.",1
"I had been looking forward to this series since it was announced, and I wasn't disappointed in the slightest. Suffice to say I binged watched it in 2 days.The story caters, of course , to the modern audience, but it is not smothered by political correctness as most current shows are (which is a blessing). It is interesting, dark, and a blend of old and new, all wrapped in a fun Burton-esque way.The lead actress is fantastic, she really captures the personality of Wednesday, she even nails the dead, cold but intense stare. But kudos should be given to the rest of the cast, because they do a great job as well,I loved Gwendoline Christie as the Head Mistress, she really plays ambiguous characters very well. Catherine Zeta-Jones and Luis Guzman are perfect in their roles, and the actress who portrays Enid (Emma Myers) nails the character.Of course there are mistakes and inconsistencies (a rainy day suddenly becoming extra sunny, with no evidence of the previous rain at all, etc), but all in all, those mistakes don't negatively affect the quality of the series.I really don't understand the viewers who compare it to the movies, and expect it to be the same. It can't be. It's been 30 years since the Addams Family movies, the world has changed, we are supposed to be moving forward and keeping up with the times. Please stop comparing old and new, ""Wednesday"" isn't a remake, it's a brand new series based on one of the characters, not the Addams Family as a whole. This series, pays a great homage to the original Addams Family, but it is firmly set in the present- as it should be.Old and new can be equally worth your time, each one for its own merits.8/10 from me, with the potential to go higher for the next season(s).",8
"This has to be one of the best Netflix shows in the last 24 months. All ages can watch and enjoy. I can't wait till next season. Actors are well casted, scenes are great. I would urge all to watch one episode and from there I will guarantee that you will binge in 1day. Just wish they did more than 8 episodes. Hope you all enjoy. !!!¡!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! As nyt said The news that Tim Burton would be directing half the episodes of ""Wednesday,"" Netflix's new dramedy about the Addams Family's death-obsessed young daughter, piqued interest. It would be Burton's first real television work in nearly 40 years, since he directed episodes of ""Faerie Tale Theatre"" and ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents."" And Burton, an often magical storyteller attracted to off-kilter material, seemed as if he might be a good match for Charles Addams's macabre cartoon family.",10
"As a lover of all things 'Burton',and the works of Gough and Millar I was hoping this might be good.....I was not disappointed...I was intrigued to see if Ms Ortega could slip into Wednesday's shoes,(..as well his C Ricci did...nice to see her in it,also...my wife did not believe it was her when I pointed her out...),but she most certainly did,brilliantly and assured. We are 4 episodes in and loving every second of this superb show. It's refreshingly messaging free,(..unlike most of Hollywoods present day output..),and the cast is uniformly likeable. Add good script and plenty of laughs and chills,all add up to a sure fire Winner. Thanks Tim and all concerned.",9
"I grew up a fan of ""The Addams Family"" on TV, major fan of the movie versions starring Angelia Houston and the late, great Raul Julia. Even a lesser fan of the animated series. The promotions for ""Wednesday"" were spectacular and I had only hoped it would live up to a fraction of the hype. But after watching 4 episodes of the 8-episode Netflix series, I am sad to report that what >I< have loved about the Addams Family; the sardonically dark humor, the double entendre of dialog, the characters whom, at their core, are deeply loving to each other. All of that has been set aside for yet another outsider teen angst series in the vein of ""Winx"" or later ""X-Men"" movies. Tim Burton's vision never evolves beyond the script. The series is superbly cast; Jenna Ortega is marvelous as ""Wednesday"", Gwendoline Christie as the Principle, in their brief appearances, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Luis Guzman rise to the roles of Morticia and Gomez, but once the setting moves to the Nevermore Academy, the story falls flat and one-note. The gentle but diabolical humor of the 1960's, and the early movie franchise is replaced with blood and gore, and this devolves into a teen drama. Am I expecting too much? Do I want that wink back to nostalgia? More Charles Addams and less Zack Snyder, perhaps? There are one or two great lines and scenes; Wednesday in the morgue, for instance; ""I just got comfortable, a few more minutes"", but that feels far and few between. What gets me is that when you think of the macabre humor that is the ""Addams Family"", this should have been a slam-dunk for Tim Burton. His movies all have that vibe to them. Wednesday, woefully, does not.",8
"Well, if you hear ""patriarchy"" is being mentioned in every episode you know what to think of this show and who the target audience is. Has nothing in common with the Addams but rather Twilight meets Harry Potter. Also, grown ups playing teenagers? Juvenile characters and artificial dialogues to please a young audience. This Wednesday is the opposite of the original character. Originally she was supportive of her family not an aggressive, hateful and opinionated brat like here. No wonder Addams fans are disappointed with this one. They have taken some aspects of the Addams in order to produce some hybrid story.",1
"Watched it all in one sitting, loved it. The dark and witty one liners were so true to the Addams Family I grew up with, I just wanted more of them! Which is meant as a compliment not a criticism. I could see the Tim Burton in this but it isn't as glaringly obvious as I expected it to be. I would have like more of the weird and twisted moments Burton is known for (I'm thinking Beetlejuice, even Batman (like Batman returns, the Penguin always really freaked me out...anyway!)) The relationships between characters are well defined, which along with the plot, keeps you engaged. Really hope they make another season, and soon!",9
"Started watching this with minimal expectations and have been pleasantly surprised with how good it has turned out to be ,
This series is a spectacular feat from the twisted mind of Tim Burton. Not only is Wednesday Addams portrayed in all her glory by the exceptionally talent Jenna Ortega but she has been updated to appeal to today's audience both ethnically and socially accurate. The mysteries are cleverly built and the performances from the rest of the cast are utterly captivating. Bravo to the impressive cgi monster that has been terrifically brought to the screen on a Netflix budget.Final word - give it a try, you might be surprised...",10
"My only real disappointment is the casting of Gomez, I like the actor Guzman, but not in this role.I would of liked the 1st episode to have been set in a ""normal"" high school setting, they could of explored/created a dynamic between Wednesday and Mortica, where Wednesday wants to stay in that type of setting, let's face it nothing more tormenting to a teenage age girl then ""knowing"" they don't fit in.I've read a few reviews were people or disappointed in this episode, expecting a more traditional Wednsday, my opinion, I feel both Burton and Ortega have successfully ""Grown ""Wednesday into a teenage girl.......those of you who have quirky daughters will appreciate this teenage Wednesday .I was never a big Tim Burton, always thought he was too over the top with sets, I do like the school, it's a more believeable place then hogwartz,
I'm looking forward to the rest of the season.",8
"Being a huge Addams fan (owning the books by Chas Addams, the tv series, the movies and, yes, even the cartoons) I've been looking forward to this new iteration since it was announced a year or two ago. I can tell you it doesn't disappoint and, in fact, delivers on all fronts. Following Christina Ricci's iconic performance is a tall order for anyone but Jenna Ortega knocks it out of the park with her portrayal of the titles title character. Her dead pan, sarcastic delivery is spot on but there's a sweetness to get poison tongue... You know, like ethylene glycol.Rather than compete with the beautiful Angelica Houston, Catherine Zeta Jones brings her own interpretation to Morticia while Luis Guzman brings to life the Gomez Addams as he appeared in the original New Yorker Cartoons. This is a smart move because when it comes to the late, great Raul Julia.... Well, just don't. There's just no replacing him so sidestepping that issue was the best thing they could do.. Who is also here...Thing, that is. Along with Lurch, Pugsley and Uncle Fester.There are also some surprises in the cast that I haven't mentioned.Tim Burton has done a terrific job here of both updating and continuing the adventures of our favorite spooky family and I'm really looking forward to season 2.",9
"Highly dubious as am an avid fan of Christina Ricci's portrayal of Wednesday Addams.But for the love of God. Stop with the rapid fire dialogue, jerky spouting of lines and the overtly aggressive delivery. Wednesday was so disarmingly loved due to her paced, frighteningly calm delivery.I had hope at the appearance of very special cameo. But it really hasn't eased.Love the appraisal of a semi familiar fac of a character that was in the original as a love interest.The breathy line delivery of all cast members is distracting at best. Not every line has to be delivered like a sledgehammer for Gothic dramatic effect.Will hang in and hope that they calm down somewhat. Otherwise holds delicious promise.",7
"!!!!!!SPOILERS!!!!!! This show is the absolute best show. The entire show I was super excited about what was happening and was super shocked when Wednesday saw her ancestors from 400 years ago. I haven't watched the entire show yet but i already watched 4 episodes. I get to watch this again with my girlfriend this weekend and I'm super excited because this might become one of my hyper fixations. You should definitely watch this show if you like mystery, horror, and suspenseful shows than this is perfect for you. You definitely need to watch this as soon as possible because this show is perfect.10/10.",10
"This was such a disappointment. I had been excited for a new Addams Family show/movie but feel like this missed on all the things that made the others good. At no point did I feel amused, much less laugh. The whole world has been changed to fantasy creatures (vampires, werewolves, sirens) being known to exist, makes the Addams' not weird. The Addams' were always extremely polite and classy. Wednesday is definitely rude not classy and sassy. Gomez was not witty and classy, Morticia was bland, Pugsly was pathetic. The family ties that bonded the Addams' in the past and was so important was absolutely gone.Aside from that, there was a common camera angle used that cut off the top of people's heads that was really annoying to me.",1
"I think the show is great, I love the fact that they added more fantasy and magic to original Addams Universum as I am a big fan of this genre, I love the hint of Harry Potter in form of the school itself and Poe Cup, I love the witty, clever and sarcastic dialogs and I think what I love the most is Thing showing the middle finger or sulking <3.Apart from that the show presents a strong female character who is not afraid to fight for her beliefs and some complicated mother-daughter relationship.The cast is perfect, especially with the idea that Christina Ricci plays one of the roles, I just hope that it would develop in a franchise which will span on many seasons :)",10
"I was unlucky and got sick, but lucky enough that it happened when Wednesday was released. Made it all more bearable and I watched the entire series with great pleasure. I loved the atmosphere, the characters and also the story.It's kind of interesting how they made a date in a crypt turn romantic. This will be exactly how all girls will want to celebrate Valentine's Day 2023.Also, I want to give the biggest round of applause to the costume creator, I want Wednesday's entire wardrobe. So crazy that I seriously ordered a black/white checkered knit dress! Love it!!I give it a 10*. Though the ending was quite predictable, but who cares..See it!",10
"Being a life long fan of the Addams family I was looking forward to this new series and got much more than I hoped for. At first was a little hard to adapt to the new actors (Gomez, Morticia) but it all takes perfect shape and everyone seems to find their place. Great mystery, plenty of dark, dry humor and one or two inside jokes for us older folk that were fans of the original series. Hope they continue this series. Jenna Ortega channels Wednesday Addams so perfectly and seems to just naturally be the perfect fit for the role. The added bits of teen drama fit nicely through the story and aren't forced or stereotypical gunk that is usually added to pander to an age group. Really enjoying this series.",10
I just wanna say Ortega bravo. I loved her performance & congratulations Netflix on a great casting. Everything I ever expected happened. Every one should watch it & what unexpected twist.would love to see another season. I can not wait to see many of her other talents. Would love to see more of uncle fester. Truly making friends can be hard but sometimes it turns out great. But I also learnt many things from Wednesday Addams but the most important one was don't make other people define who you are & who you are gonna be. & the suspense is killing me WEDNESDAY ADDAMS. CANT wait on WHAT WOULD WEDNESDAY ADDAMS DO.,10
"A series for kids I guess, might be a good one time watch when you've a lot of free time. It wasn't boring, moderately enjoyable, nice. All the characters has done their part nicely. Jenna ortega as Wednesday adams was praiseworthy. But I hoped to see the Adams family a bit more. But no further season is needed in my opinion, probably make a spin off series of Pugsley now! People are gushing over a little too much over this I guess. The series deserves a 5 star rating that's appropriate in my opinion. That's all from me. Why do we have to write such a long ass review? Ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.",5
"Okay whattttt?! I was not expecting this to be that good. But I was hooked immediately. The whole production is so good. I only wish Netflix had released it in October because it would be so perfect for Halloween. Tim Burton is a phenomenal director, and every cast member is perfect for their roles. Jenna plays Wednesday so well, I saw an interview where she spoke about taking direction from Burton. You can tell she really enjoyed playing the character, and her commitment shows on screen. The ""high school"" Netflix show trope has run its course so many times before, it feels stale, but this is so obviously different and fresh.",10
"I'll make this short, and not divulge any spoilers.I really enjoyed this a lot, and certainly hope that it gets additional seasons. The sole (minimal) levity in the whole series relates to a few situations involving ""Thing"". Beyond that, pretty much everything else revolves around a dark story line, and dark events (monsters, killings ,etc.), with the main character (Wednesday) determined to figure out what is going on. Ortega provides a stunningly great performance as Wednesday, and there is a great supporting cast, who also do an excellent job, to complement Ortega's performance.This is really just a horror series, although, for the most part, considerably more subtle than the typical horror outing. It's Ortega's consistent character that keeps the viewer embedded in the ongoing activities, and not allowing it to slip off into some lesser (silly) genre. It's definitely an interesting binge.",10
"So I'm... pretty underwhelmed. Having only seen episode one, I'm torn between the hope it might get better after a few episodes, and exasperation at Wednesday being so unbelievably unlikeable.I get that Wednesday is supposed to be dark and moody and obsessed with death - none of which I would mind.'This' Wednesday is incapable of having a conversation with anyone without saying something hurtful or condescending, and it very quickly loses its charm - if there ever was any. She's the main character, and we're supposed to be rooting for her, but I find it incredibly difficult to do so. I actually keep hoping someone will put her in her place.As most teenage girl protagonists these days, she considers herself a victim of parental oppression (after they send her to a school for ""outcasts"" rather than let her get charged for attempted murder, how awful of them). She's like a not-funny parody of what a moody teenager is like.Aside from generally disliking the titular character, there's other stuff I'm not a fan of either. The cliche school cliques, the ""all grown-ups are enemies""-trope, the fact that this series seems way too much like any generic YA fantasy series to be an actual Burton project... like, I'm upset, ya'll.But Wednesday's behaviour and demeanour is by far what puts me off the most. She's got the perfect grades, is the one who protects her bullied little brother, is amazing at fencing, and writing, and saying really smart-sounding things... but she's so friggin mean and malicious to 'everyone', including those who truly have done nothing to deserve it. She's a mean Mary Sue.I will keep watching just to see if it gets better, but I'm not too hopeful.",3
"I was not expecting this to be any good, considering it's done by netflix, however I was greatly impressed with this show, think it just became my favorite of the year.You will see lot of people saying ""This is not for you"" as if they know better and as in they take the decision for you, however, I would greatly recommend giving the show a try and decide it for yourself if you like it not.Jenna Ortega is wonderful cast in the role, but pretty much everyone else just as well, the acting is great, the music, the effects - everything, I can't say I could think of any negative thing to say about it except the fact that I didn't enjoy how her father Gomez was introduced but is something I could easily get past since the show is about Wdnesday and not her family. (though nothing wrong with the actor or acting for Gomez either, just how he was written).You should never let other people dictate what to watch, you cannot discuss taste or force people into liking the same things. Many shows released this year got a huge wave of hate and almost made me skip watching them just because others said they are bad...and guess what ? I ended up enjoying many of them.As I write this review, the show is rated at 8.5 stars after 5,5k votes, which means those that dislike the show are in such low number that it doesn't even affect the show overall.Happy binge day.",10
"As a huge fan of not only the Addams Family, but Tim Burton as well, this show exceeded my expectations! I binge watched the entire season in one evening & couldn't stop watching! I honestly feel like those who complained about it being ""too far from the original Addams family"" missed the entire point of it being a coming of age/teenage PROGRESSION. It's not a remake, it's not even a sequel to the old movies, it is its own entity & shows the maturity of Wednesday and her coming in to her own. Also, those complaining about the casting, especially with Gomez, obviously aren't familiar with the original comics the show was based on to begin with: the casting was actually pretty spot on, with its own original flair added. Tim Burton has always been imaginative, creative and a visionary and ""Wednesday"" is no exception. Fingers crossed for a second season.",10
"I loved this series from the first episode, so intriguing, I would love to see more.I feel like i can relate to Wednesday's character so much which makes me enjoy it even more. Binge-watched it and now i can't wait for a new season. It had just the right amount of everything.I began to watch it due to me being a big fan of Jenna Ortega. She was the perfect choice for this and no one could've done it better.Each episode left me wanting to watch more, I do recommend this for people of ages between 10-30. In my experience with older adults I believe they would not enjoy it as much, but should still give it a try.Once again hoping to see more.Season 2 WHENN???",10
"This is literally the best netflix series I've ever watched. The dark comedy, atmosphere, mystery, intensity and acting everything was just right for captivating me. Usually when I watch series there are some boring parts or dialogues that I skip but not this time. I watched it to completion in one go. Definitely a 10/10 for me. It's trailer was enough for make me wait for it, thankfully the series didn't disappoint at any level. Jenna ortega performed her role exemplary she was truly amazing I loved it ??. The best thing in this series was wednesday herself and the second will be its mystery which forces you to suspect many characters at the same time and that captivates you till the end. Definitely a 10/10 for me. Already waiting for 2nd season.",10
"Whatever people were expecting from Tim Burton, he delivered it & even 10 times more than that.Brilliant Direction & Brilliant Writing throughout the series. Unlike some other recent mystery movies & series, villain's identity was so well hidden & everybody seemed villain till the end. I did not lose interest at any point in the series.Brilliant brilliant work by everyone, especially the lead Jenna Ortega. Probably the best work by her till date. Watching her since Jane the Virgin & Stick in the middle & she is getting better day by day.Emma Myers, Christina Ricci, Hunter Doohan, Percy White, did good work too.Series finished with an open end, so I'm hoping there will be season 2.",9
"I love the original Addams Family films and was curious whether this would be anywhere near as good and I'm pleasantly surprised by how brilliant it is. So many shows nowadays are so predictable and cringe but this was really funny the whole way through. The casting and acting was spot on, (love how Christina Ricci, the OG Wednesday, is in the show), the camerawork and colour grading are excellent and the wardrobe and music are great too. Really enjoyed this series and want more! I would've given 10 stars if there were more episodes, 8 is not enough! ...........................................",9
"Nice production and the performance of the lead actress, but the show was just too predicable. Was the main lady villain based off of the sheep villain from Zootopia? The overt friendliness and just over the top good intent? The same for the monster, they went about it in a too obvious manner - they shed the least suspicion on him which was a give away.I don't know for the half of it I was gripped and interested, but then when they confirmed who the villains are, I was so disappointed.I really feel like it could have been better, but it was okay to watch nevertheless. I don't have hopes for a better season two unfortunately though.",5
"Its entertaining and has harry potter vibes, frankly entertaining, but there is still the odd comment and action by wednesday that feels out of place and more to do with current stances on this, now it's not overly in your face, but really, can you just entertain me and not lecture, since whoever still doesnt know how to conduct themselves in 'modern' social media world, isnt going to care and perhaps needs reminding, the general viewer who does care about how to treat people already knows how to treat people.Apart from what I've 'splaned' the first few episodes were really interesting
and the the vibe, but it's moving more and more towards something else - only three episodes in so maybe the score will get higher.Kudos to the team :)",5
"While randomly picking up my upcoming show to watch on Netflix, its oversimplified title did not really give me any promising expectation.But thing went straight for me to realize it was definitely what I should have spent my day on, when the background was briefly mentioned, triggering my brain to acknowledge that it had the jokes I have ever wanted. The dark humors were fascinating, though they were what I could imagine.However, it was such a good time to have seen a show with numerous of it and not being awkward but cheerful.Hope it can get its second season and things can continue with their unique vibes.",10
"Every episode was addictive, so much so that I watched all 8 before I went to bed. The actors did a great job, the plot is mostly smooth, but don't expect this to be a childrens series, you will be very shocked later on that this series sometimes has Rated R material. The Hyde was a very menacing monster that gave me the shivers, that design is really creepy. The monster works best in a dark environment but later on, it shows that the CGI is low quality. Don't get me started with thos transformations because they are really noticeably bad. Other than the poor CGI, this show is a must watch! I don't reccomend children to watch this show.",8
"The first thing that struck me was the brother being locked up in the lockers and began crying because of it. The sad part is he enjoys pain, and torture. So he would actually enjoy what happen to him. It's really a show that lives off the fake idea that girls are stronger the boys. It's a weak story and bland one at that. Bad casting and how's her father that Hispanic and she doesn't hav one characteristics of being Hispanic.It's a bad wanna be Adam's family spin off and personally want My time back. If I had a case I'd sue Netflix for destroying my child with this horrible show.Give credit to anyone who can sit and watching nightmare.",2
"Don't really know where the bad critics are coming from. This show is amazing, coming from an Addams Family fan! I see complaints about not enough Tim Burton, but I see Tim Burton everywhere! I want more of this! I need at least 6 more seasons. The darkness of Wednesday Addams is brought with both humor and real, deep and strong emotions. I have ASD and recognize parts of myself in her. Not sure if that was the intention though but for me it gives me all the more reason to love this show. They managed to build her character way beyond the Wednesday from the movies and I find that a great accomplishment considering she was never the main character.",10
"The departure of Tim Burton as the director past the first 4 episodes was quite clearly felt, the show started looking and feeling a lot more like the average netflix series, Burton has such a nice eye for set design and despite the rest of the series still having the same visuals they aren't framed quite as well nor adhered to as much.The performances all around were very good, the characters are well written and there are satisfying arcs for all the main players, i especially liked the main friendship dynamic between Wednesday and Enid, Thing was also really good i didn't expect a disembodied hand to be among the best characters in the show.The show does fall apart somewhat in the last two episodes and i think it's a problem that is way more prominent here because the show isn't released weekly but all at once, so when binge watching it, the twists of the plot very quickly feel like a muddled and hurried along mess. Like she's just wildly throwing around accusations and it just seemed completely dumb and a little out of character with how tight lipped and secretive she had been up untill then. The show also feels very Harry Potter-esque and in the last episode it went from feeling inspired by to basically coming across like a Harry Potter fanfic with some OC characters.Hope to see another season in the future, because while it wasn't perfect the show had me invested in the story and all of its characters.",8
"As a life long fan devotee of Charles Addam's creepy and kooky family, I will be very judgmental of every adaptation that comes our way, and I have to say this mysterious and spooky series is amazing.Jenna Ortega shines as the oldest Addams' daughter, it's almost as if she was born to play the child of woe. Ortega transformation into Wednesday seems effortless, she has all the quirks, coldness and mean insults associated with her, but in such an expert hands, Wednesday does not seem cartoonish nor one-dimensional, she is portrayed with incredible depth.The series is also directed by Tim Burton, and his love for the macabre and Hammer Horror us incredibly noticeable here, and so is his dark sense of humor.The supporting cast is incredible as well, specially Emma Myers as Enid, her colorful personality are a surprisingly well match for our color deprived protagonist.If you were a fan of Wednesday Addams before you will love the series, id the character is new to you this series will make you fall for her.A Gothic murder mystery with a twist of irreverent dark humor, there are not enough words to praise this series.",10
"So... is this directed by THE Tim Burton, or is it a guy with the same name? This is annoyingly bad.1) The story is incoherent
2) The dialogues sound unnatural
3) The acting.... Like a b movie to say the least
4) Direction: doesn't look like burton, it is really sloppy
5) childish cinematography, every scene uses a very shallow depth of field, again, really Tim?6) special effects look fake
7) the jokes.... There are no jokes. You can tell there were supposed to be from the punch lines, on which you don't laugh.Maybe this series should be promoted to children, under the age of 10?Very disappointing result from one of my favorite directors.",1
"Not sure why there are such good reviews here. Some of them genuinely seem fake. This show was really poor me and my partner like Tim Burton and the Addams family so expected something good here. Its neither got Tim burton's gothic style or any remote feeling of the Addams family. Wednesday is just mean with no fun qualities, Pugsley is a wimp, and Gomez and Mortisha keep mumbling their lines so god knows what their characters are like. Then they got rid of the family and put Wednesday in Hogwarts with even worse characters with even worse CGI. Jeez, we really wanted to enjoy this but quickly saw it was just a big cash grab by Netflix trying to create a new Harry Potter franchise. Don't waste your time.",1
"Honestly the show is fantastic, I wasn't aware of it coming and but when I seen it I thought it will be typical Addams family show but we got soo much more.While some people may want to see the rest of the family you need to keep in mind the show focuses on Wednesday and her journey.Honestly the humour and horror is perfectly balanced where we really get to enjoy the show. The costumes are phenomenal and the crew did a great job on them.As to the story it moves at a great pace and is really interesting leaving you wanting more.Tim Burton really added his creative touch to this series and I can only hope this will be a long running series as the possibilities are endless as to where they can take the story. I hope it runs for a good few year with many seasons.But I must say Jenna Ortega is absolutely perfect as Wednesday. Her acting is absolutely perfect and she captures the character like no other. To be fair all of the cast are acting really well which makes the show all that more enjoyable.Highly recommend the show and hope to see more seasons in the future!",10
"9 stars for Ortega. 10 stars for her delightful greyscale wardrobe. 5 stars for plot. ~7 stars overall.Ortega (Wednesday), Myers (Enid), and ""Thing"" are mostly delightful in their roles. The rest of the cast are adequate to forgettable. It was good to see Ricci in a supporting role, even though her appearances were few. This Uncle Fester was a bit off, but at least he showed up.This teen version of Wednesday is fun & more nuanced than Ricci's, but the overall tone of the show unfortunately doesn't go as ""dark"" as it could have. There were 2 moments when I nearly laughed, and only a few smiles along the way.You'd hardly know Wednesday is at a boarding SCHOOL, as she's in class about 60 seconds total. The vamps do nothing, and the rest of the kids barely show their creature-natures.",7
"Jenna Ortega has knocked this one out of the park! The whole series is amazing! Fingers crossed for a second! The casting as a whole has been very good. I would like to see more Uncle Fester if there is another series or even a stand alone Fester series. The storyline keeps you gripped with a whos done it and then very clever pulls it all together. Keep watching don't google the spoilers. There are some nods to the original movies throughout the series which was a good touch! Again though the portrayal of Wednesday was just perfect, she's definitely on for some awards after this. Must watch!!!",10
"Honestly I was a bit judgy in the beginning but wow. Tim Burton is still the man I see. This was perfect in every way shape and form. It's takes a minute to adjust because remember this is only about Wednesday, this is her adventures. But with the right touch a Addams still. This is the best. Season 2 better come quickly because I'm salivating for more. Honestly they had the best scenes that showed her truly as we remember her, heartless and stone cold, but this gave her a different side. And emotional one. The actress that they chose, pure gold. This girl had a bright future ahead of her, as I have seen her on some other shows. Just perfection. Absolute perfection. I will tell you as I told my snap chat, this was a chefs kiss.",10
"This is what I would call regressed preppy: it's safe, insular and fluffy yet violent, erotic and toxic, that thing where it simultaneously feels like a very young children's tv show AND an X-rated movie. A very jarring experience with continuous whiplash, just totally caught off guard by the combination. It's Spongebob Squarepants meets Freddy Kruger.It's like being immersed in an identity crisis, wanting to be perceived as sweet, soft, and innocent yet that repressed wild side and agenda can't help but peek through. It makes for a very calculated experience which is totally unimmersive.For example, you can just tell that they used White coded passing bullies in that overcorrection/overcompensating 'see, we're not biased' way. Then you can see how they specifically, actively, put a Black coded passing bully for another scene as a way to balance it out and/or stick to their comfortable biased routine.Or how the characters keep emphasizing how ""white"" Wednesday is which is just poorly cloaked Casteism. Wednesday might as well ask a mirror 'who the fairest of them all' is.Then you have the questionable romance/social plots which almost seem to normalize or glorify toxic behavior. You know, rude for no reason, zero empathy yet is still supposed to be likable and is liked by others or insta-love type of stuff. It's starting to become disturbing and not in a good way.Other than that it's just very predictable and flat entertainment due to the approach: the lore, tone and aesthetic is just superficial wrapping on another typical teen drama with flat trope characters and identity cult propaganda. The Woman cultism was in full effect: Men are 2D-evil except love interest(s), perfect female protagonist has unlimited skills, abilities and knowledge and wispy/waify/skinny character with little to no muscle tone can beat up anyone, typically a male.The over reliance on formula is also clear, I mean, a werewolf character that says 'This kitty has claws'? Just because it has been used successfully before in other media and vaguely correlates? Since when were (retractable) claws the weapons of werewolves? Fangs would of made more sense or why not just make them say 'This puppy has claws' or make them a Werecat? Instead they just put tropes, cliches and formulas in a blender without a lid and used whatever flew out. It can also been seen in how Wednesday literally talks in wry, sarcastic, macabre come backs. We're talking 95% of Wednesday's lines and that is zero exaggeration.Lastly, the exposition. Why are you using all of the dialogue to explain to the audience what is currently happening right in front of our faces? Dialogue is there to weave a story and express characters, not to talk down to us.This IS just a magic mirror for the matching demographic (light featured, dainty, logical/socialite Women and the 'Latinx' Women/Other Women that aspire to be them) which is what all shows are becoming, 'chosen one' simulators. At least if it wasn't your vibe or matching demographic it was watchable but now it's just so bludgeoning, obstructive and exclusionary.If you're the matching demographic you may enjoy it and why not as I said most demographics seem to be doing it but what happened to stories, character flaws, and creativity instead of risk-free formulas, decadent self worship and identity cult propaganda?",2
"I have grown watching adams family in black and white,amazing,my favourite character was Wednesday,the actress is a Wednesday,but the show not,i watch it till the end,waiting to see something that Wednesday is ,her apathy,all what Wednesday was,but she is not an Investigator,its like harry potter,thats what that show is,the uncle looks so stupid here,even the father,i hope if there will be,a second seazon,will not look like this,shame for what Wednesday was,if people grown as i did,with the idea that adams family was,in black and white,will be disappointed,younger generation may like it,sorry Netflix,you screw another great story..",3
"As someone who grow up and adores the Addams Family, this was an interesting concept. It's not the most amazing thing I've seen, but it's not terribly awful either.I was happy when I saw Christina Ricci was in this, she is always great. I enjoyed her character. Jenna Ortega was awesome as Wednesday, she understood the assignment and nailed it. A+Catherine Zeta-Jones as Morticia, no this was not a good choice at all even with her only in two episodes. Luis Guzman as Gomez, why? Again this was NOT a smart casting decision. There was zero chemistry between these two, it was just weird and awkward to watch. They felt so out of place compared to the rest of cast.Thing was a delight as per usual. He has always been my favourite character. I enjoy his updated look. Christopher Lloyd will always be my number one Fester, but Fred Armisen was still decent. The rest of the cast did a good job and played their characters well.At times, it doesn't have the same feel as other Tim Burton classics. The reason for this is because some episodes are not directed by Burton. However, the episodes with Tim, you can absolutely tell it's him. The CGI was good but not spectacular. The story was interesting and humorous. I was laughing at Wednesday's statements quite often. Also, the dance scene was epic!The soundtrack is fun and definitely feels more like Tim Burton. One of my favourite scenes was when Wednesday played Paint it Black on the cello. I love the cello and had goosebumps, it was so beautiful to listen to.I rate this 8/10. It was worth watching, I didn't feel like I wasted my time. It left me wanting more. It is geared more towards teens, but adults like myself will enjoy it too. I would gladly watch a second season. My only desire is that if this does get a second season, that they cast different actors to play Morticia and Gomez.",8
"This is an amazing spin off of the original Addams Family. The visuals are amazing and it is one of the best Netflix shows. Jenna Ortega and Emma Meyers do an amazing job and made the show vivid and are one with their characters.The script is a bit off somehow - it feels like it's a forced on the main characters. Side plots are not getting anywhere, and the characters have to act a certain way that is more focused on the story rather than their own motives.I am also not entirely sold on the characters and portrayal of Morticia and Gomez - it is different than the original movies and story. There is no chemistry, and the characters' looks are off (based on the original description).Nevertheless, if you don't compare and watch it as a show on it's own, it is a very good. I laughed, I broke down, it is overall a very entertaining series.",8
"They definitely do a second seasonStory , acting , all was amazingThe actors and dialogs also perfect

"The 8 episode show gives you insight on what Wednesday Addams life is like in High School. The mix of combined spooky vibes, character portrayal and mystery really makes you want to watch all 8 episodes in one sitting. I absolutely loved this series, I think Jenna Ortega did a phenomenal job of portraying the iconic Wednesday we all love. She gave an authentic depiction of the character as she grows up. The setting and plot were perfect, you really get attached to the characters and the plot of the series. If you want to watch a really good, funny, mysterious binge worthy show, I highly recommend.",10
"When I found out that ortega, was gonna play as wendsday. I was excited! Everyone was too! And couldn't wait to watch it. When it finally released I watched it, seeing the actors and the details like the mansion and the personality of everyone on the screen it was enduringly GOOD. The camera shots and the lighting was perfect, and jenna ortega fits brilliantly in Tim Burton Wensday and gotta say the CGI wasn't as great as I hoped like some shots looks good but most of the time it looked not so good. For example the monster CGI looked like it came from the mask movie from the 19s. But watch anyway.",8
"Don t know what has happened here? Tim Burton was part of this ?? As far as next stupid Netflix production does not surprise me, still in shock that T. B was involved in this.. and to leave a review here I need to have 600 signs... Jeez... Oki, so what else can I write, not funny at all, the history was not interesting at all, apart from some scene, it suppose to be movie for 10 years old. Music was ok, and probably the best part of this. Actors - nothing special, dialogues... ???! Was there at least one apart dialogue there???? No? 8 episodes and found 0 nice comments, the last episode the worst one. Wow finally 600 signs...",2
"This is good stuff.The first few chapters are best, but the whole thing is real good.They nailed the casting and respected the Addams legacy.It's dark-ish, funny and entertaining all along.If anything, feels a little bit short, one or two episodes short. That's how good it is; no fillers, and you are left wanting a little bit more.There is just as much explanation as required, enough info to round up the characters and make you care about them,...
I won't spoil it, but the ending leaves you with a small hint of sadness. And that's good, because it means it made you care about it.The door for another season is left open.The novelty will be gone by then, as well as all the introductory arc where we and the rest of characters get to know Wednesday.They'll have a hard time topping this one. Here's for hoping they give it a go.Well done you!",9
"Bit of a snoozer. It seems like the producers, writers, or powers that may (or may not) be, hung their hat on one character of what was an ensemble cast show back in the day. That's not to say that I was a fan of the old show, I'd seen it when I was young, but to me they took the prominent aspects of one character, accentuated them, and then tried to plug a storyline that could have worked with a recreation/adaption of any old tv show or movie that addresses or even abutted the strange, magical or supernatural world.In sum, the storyline might work on its own, or accompanied by a better backstory, but it ultimately fell short for.Also found it a bit immature.",3
"I can't imagine a more perfect casting for Wednesday. The plot is a little hard to follow and people expecting this to be an Addams Family reboot will not be happy, but the show stands on its own. It's enjoyable and unique and definitely worth the watch if only for Ortega's performance. The cinematography is beautiful as well, everything is catered around Wednesday, so she stands out in every scene, even in a school full of ""outcasts"". I especially enjoyed the juxtaposition between Wednesday and her bubbly roommate. People who enjoyed Charlie and The Chocolate Factory and Series of Unfortunate Events will love this show.",9
"It sounds strange, but the original Addams Family and the movies from the early 90s have heart - this does not seem to exist here.It is difficult to portray a character that was perfectly portrayed already, but I'm not sure if it is Ortega's doing or if this is how the part was written or how she was directed. Ricci's Wednesday wasn't self-absorbed or angst-ridden, she was part of the family unit and wasn't constantly out to prove herself. She was already confident and didn't need to be rude or defensive. She was mature beyond her years. She didn't want to die, she was interested in death.And while I know this show is focused on the one character, I find the absence of the family-first value we got in the earlier renditions of the Addams' to be off-putting.Maybe it's just not for someone of my generation, we already had our Wednesday Addams, and this one is just too hateful.",1
"I had high hopes going in since I'm a huge fan of Cristina Ricci, Jenna Ortega and Catherine Zeta-Jones and Wednesday did not disappoint! It was a well-crafted and imaginative series that kept me guessing until the final episode! I grew up watching the original Addam's Family Series on reruns as well as the cartoons so was very happy to see that the new series stayed truer to the original cartoon depictions of the characters. I was nervous that it would be too similar Chilling Adventures of Sabrina given the setting at Nevermore Academy but was happy that it was just a dark yet possessed more dark humor and emotion than the Sabrina series. Fingers crossed that there will be a season 2 and beyond!",9
"A great watch. Tim Burton has created a masterpiece series.Amazon and the Rings of Power creators should take note - Now, this is how you adapt a beloved, established IP.Well acted and a gripping story that unfolds across 8 episodes. Likeable new characters and a respectful rendition of the characters we know and love. Jenna Ortega and Emma Myers shine as our main protagonists but the whole supporting cast did a stellar job.The visuals and the music were also top-notch.You can tell that everyone involved poured their love into this project and it shows. Well done to all involved.Can't wait for a season 2 and I hope it lives up to this season.",9
"Nice surprise, and gets better after a couple of episodes and the expectations of a classics Addams family story.Actually, this is more of a Addams Family meets Harry Potter, with lots of elements that hint on the atmosphere of a Hogwarts-like setting - the school, students divided into groups/houses, the peculiar headmaster, and so on...
Very nice show that deserves a watch.The nice touches given by Tim Burton are obviously a plus, such as having Christina Ricci in the cast (which makes us be constantly looking for the Wednesday in her).The plotline is pretty decent as well, even though the script is not a masterpiece...it is quite gripping.",9
"How anyone can rate this highly I will never understand. The dialogue is so terrible that it makes the brilliant cast seem like terrible actors. If Tim Burton wanted to make Harry Potter movie then he should have done that. This is a huge failure of his attempt at that. I'm surprised that he directed the first four episodes. The cinematography is flat and boring. Nothing looks good or has any style to it. After four episodes I'm giving up. How this has an 8 rating is baffling. It's one of the worst things Tim Burton has done and the absolute worst thing Netflix has put out, which is saying a lot. I truly hope this does not get another season.",3
"Once in a while a show comes along on there that I go wow... yes, this is what I am paying for. Now give me more. The season is contained but short. Ortega's Wednesday is exceptional, you will grow to love her and her supporting cast. The music and scenes set a great tone... (yes, I am listening to APOCALYPTICA: Nothing Else Matters as I write this)It's dark, with some clever word play to give it a lighter tone at times as a nod to the older shows but...it's not a comedy. Regardless, It kept me engaged right to the end and I look forward to more. I'd love to see a bit longer seasons...A binge worthy endeavor on the part of Burton and crew. They have done a masterful job with this series.",9
I get that this is supposed to be a different universe and a darker version but I dislike that Wednesday resents Morticia. The point of the Addams Family is that they are a loving family dispite being creepy. I feel like that's the one line you don't cross. Also the CGI is really bad. The set up doesn't make sense to me. Pugsley was tied up and shoved into a locker. If he is an Addams shouldn't he enjoy being tortured. Also it was too cartoonish for normies to do it feels like something an Addams would do. I also don't care for what they did to Wednesday's. She went from deadpan to rude know it all. I know it's a different version but I just don't care for it. The pun game and quips we're on point though.,5
"The best villains are relatable and fleshed out characters, not boring psychopaths that just run around terrorizing the townsfolk because they're supposed to as 'the bad guys'. But we'll get to that.First I gotta say: as a detective, Wednesday Addams comes across looking like a bonehead more often than I'd like.She stumbles through the series getting next to nothing right and constantly endangering her friends along the way, many of whom deserved more screen time than they got.And alas, the eventual payoff of the big reveal very nearly doesn't warrant the investment. Since at that point it wasn't much of a reveal, and it sacrifices some well-rounded characters by turning them into rote villains, wasting the effort put into their backstories in the first place.Jenna Ortega and her costars had a lot of work to do to make up for the shortcomings of the writing, yet while it is a near thing, they did manage to pull it off.7/10 Stars. I wouldn't say no to a second season, but I won't go looking for it any time soon.",7
"It's the Addam's Family adapted for a target audience who wouldn't have liked the original Addams Family and I don't get why would anyone write and market a tv show around characters that don't fit the story that is gonna be told.I'm saying that because I've read a lot of comments from viewers afraid of watching this because they heard that Adams were kinda horror movie characters (which they aren't).It turned out like a cheap, generic Harry Potter mixed with a personality lacking Wednesday Addams. I hope to see Jena Ortega in other, more interesting roles, though, she's great! I'm not sure it will get another season.",3
"Oh i am so utterly obsessed with this show! Wednesday is EVERYTHING! And don't even get me started on her character development because my god did that make me an emotional mess. Love how realistically painfully slow it happened too, it was so bittersweet to watch. The plot twist towards the end, which i was deep down fearing though, stung a tiny bit since i was really into that whole part of the show too and was rooting for wednesday but it's making me even more excited for a second season which is hopefully happening! Special mention to the very likeable characters of edin and eugene and of course thing!! <3.",10
"Alright. First things first: yes, the dialogue can be pretty bad at times, for a couple different reasons. The dialogue between the students can be a little off, but Gen Z is a hard demographic to write for if you're not us. I get that, so I give it a pass.The other reason I can see people disliking the writing for this show is the campiness (a.k.a. Corniness). I personally didn't have an issue, as I feel like that's still pretty true to the Addams' Family tone.Now, for the stuff I feel is good. Firstly, hats absolutely off to the casting crew; y'all did fantastic. I don't think there was a bad performance in here (maybe with the exception of Luis Guzmán, but he still did okay). Jenny Ortega was brilliant as Wednesday and I can't think of a better actor after having watched.The set design was absolutely wonderful, specifically within Nevermore. I do also love the juxtaposition of a vaulted-ceiling castle with small town America; I feel it adds a good contrast and reasoning for some character decisions.The soundtrack and score bring a brilliant mix of classical, macabre, haunting to a fundamentally teen story, with good taste in song choice to match.The general plot and mystery of the whole season gripped me. There was a solid mix of clues that let you hypothesize and try to solve it alongside Wednesday, both from maguffins and cinematic cues. It kept me guessing the whole time, and questioning when things didn't necessarily line up. Overall, a genuinely satisfying mystery to watch unravel.I loved this show, and I'll be waiting with baited breath.",9
From the start I thought I was watching a Slytherin character at a spin-off Hogwarts school but all in all the show goes well from start to finish with a nice witty character dialogue I found myself giggling at time to time listening to their conversations and Wednesdays need for a negative view on everything.my over all experience was met with satisfaction and I'm left wanting more season 2 please. It Would be nice to have more off the family the Addams gatherings. I was not sure if I would enjoy this but I was wrong in the end the show holds up well the acting is strong on all parts the cinematography is top notch.,7
"I havent seen a better use of symbolism in any modern tv show. This show has an amazing storyline, characters, and intrigue. My main and only complaint was with the actor choice for Gomez Addams and Morticia Addams I dont think they were the best actors for the job and just did not do the trick for me, even though I do find Luis Guzmán to be a magnificent actor and i do think a mexican american actor would suit the role best, I dont think he suit the on screen gomez vibe of the late and great Raul Julia, But none the less he did a good job. The portrial of Wednesday by Jenna Ortega was abosutely magnificent.",10
"I'm not sure if the people who rated and reviewed it watched the entire series in its entirety, yet. I'm wondering if the rave reviews and ratings are more for initial half of the season. I can say that I have watched it in its entirety and I would say it's between a 6 to 7 out of 10 with 10 being best. I was excited that the people behind Smallville TV show got together with Tim Burton to make this. Unfortunately, Tim Burton only directed first half of season and that's about the only part of the season that was most engaging to watch.The writing quality is uneven. It starts out strong first half which is important to first engage the audience, but fell kinda flat and drawn out after the first half of the season. I definitely feel the whole storyline could have been condensed to like 6 episodes instead of 8 without sacrificing quality. It's like show production got rushed and the writing got lazier from middle to end.Jenna Ortega's performance as Wednesday is the best part about the show truly. I've seen her in ""Scream 5"" and ""You"" playing similar characters that it's refreshing to see her show more versatility, showcasing her talent and acting range as a more different character.Spoiler from here down: It's one of those cases where as a viewer you figure out who's dunnit and becomes exhausting when Wednesday has pretty much exhausted all avenues before figuring out who's dunnit. It got annoying and my patience wore thin. And seemed like filler to draw the show out to have more unecessary episodes than it needed to have at the sacrifice in quality. By the time I realize the show quality goes downhill from here it's like I'm in it too deep to not finish at this point and I can't think of any other show I'd rather watch instead cuz I've felt like I've exhausted everything worth watching at this point. I also got annoyed when certain characters make stupid, obvious mistakes like for example a character turning their back on the villain they know is still there because their distracted by the villain killing a major character. While this level of stupidity of the characters is not unique to just this show, it's still annoyingly obvious and a sad attempt to add suspense and thrill in the moment and is a trope. Back turning against the bad guy happened about twice in the same episode.I would watch a second season. It's watchable. I do think because it's drawn out some people are gonna give up about about 5-6 episodes in cuz quality goes down from there and it gets a little boring and drawn out and the show doesn't quite redeem itself even with the conclusion of the mystery.It's got a similar feel to CW's Nancy Drew but lacks villain of the week and more villain of the season arc, but with better quality story initially and a lack of gratuitous sex scenes.",7
"Wow i wasn't expecting to like this show so much since it was my most anticipated show to watch on Netflix and Jenna Ortega killed it as Wednesday Addams ! I love how dark but funny it is and i couldn't believe tyler was the hyde and that Laurel was Alive , i need a season 2 because it was that good of a show and Christina Ricci killed it as Marilyn Thornhill and Laurel Gates . I wasn't expecting to enjoy this show so much!!!! Go watch this show everyone because it'll leave you wanting more of Christina Ricci 's character and wanting a second season ................ I definitely recommend this show .....",10
"Was sceptical at first on how they would make a hole season about my favourite character but I was amazed on how they did it. Jenna plays Wednesday so great, loved the whole story line. Tim Burton has done an amazing job of expanded on Wednesday character and who she is. Would love to see a second season about this. Definitely recommend. Was just great watching Wednesday grow as a person, how she was finding out more about her self and family. How her minds works and her abiltiy to be so detached from everything and everyone around her and yet making attachments at the same time was just great.",10
"This show is by far one of the best Netflix has released in the past years. It certainly is my new favorite show! The characters are perfect, the acting is great and the storyline is entertaining and mystical. The CGI of the monster could have been better but it does suit the theme. The villain arc was predictable but still an absolute 10/10. Jenna played Wednesday insanely good and Enid, in my opinion, deserves even more screen time in season 2! Enid is just as interesting of a character as Wednesday is - great writers and show producers. The suspense is killing me indeed. Can't wait for season 2.",10
"Wednesday joins school and is instantly great at everything, there is no heartless evil, no confrontation, there is just a mild competitiveness with the other children.... Previous incarnations of Wednesday would have tortured the room mate on the first day, turned psychiatrist mad and have burnt down the school... the actor looks the part and speaks amazingly but the character is simply just a mildly gothic person at school, nothing moreIf they are going to put out other seasons, they need to find better writers to make it more ruthless... have better one-line come-backs and less meaningless conversations to prove how Wednesday is better than other characters... lose the silly love interests and have consequences for people who challenge Wednesday.",6
"When I saw the trailer for this series announced, it gave me a jolt of joy. Not least since I saw the films from the 1990's. And not being American I'd have seen the original series later.Now of course it would have been greater if Anjelica Huston had been in the role of Morticia, but all in all - not a bad choice in casting.The series is full of choice morsels of beloved quotes that fit the plot like a glove, and the masterful hands of Tim Burton is pure pleasure to watch.Actually I would love to, and I do believe quite a few would agree with me that it has an almost Harry Potter'ish quality over it.I am looking forward to the next season.",9
"I enjoyed watching this so much. Tim Burton as always made an amazing job combining the mystery plot and fairytales. The jokes are funny and gloomy, really the ""Addams""style. I liked so much the irony of Christina Ricci playing ""Thornhill"" (don't wanna be a spoiler, so just watch the movie :D), since I personally adore her as Wednesday Addams, she played this role brilliantly (of course Jenna Ortega is also made a great job, very talented girl). Can't wait to see new episodes as soon as possible! I know that the story is concentrated on Wednesday, but hope that there will be a little bit more of all Addams, since they all have so noticeable personalities, it will bring more sparkles to the plot.",9
"This is not your Wednesday Addams from the Adam family movies. Think more of Gothic version of Harriet Spy goes to Monster High. Ricci even playing a different character still steals the show.I thought the movie was be Wednesday, dealing with the teenage years, and learning to live in a society where she is the outcast. Instead we get werewolves, vampires, shape shifters and all sorts of past story line of the Adams that we were never told about. And we learn about a new ability the Adamas family have, which has never even hinted at it.Fun show but it not a classic like the movies. Made to compete with Monster High?",7
"Such a great show. The dark sarcastic humour is very well delivered, I constantly burst into laughter. Episode one has a fantastic colour palette. I love the music, characters, acting and the dialogue is on point.The acting is so good, Wednesday casting is excellent, I want more of Nevermore. Love the story, twist and turns, good pacing.This is why I love TV series, we get to discover new talents and new gem such as this.Unlike block buster movies where you get stuck with the same famous stars for almost every movie. And if they're rich they'll cast themselves as the lead in their own movie :p, TV series has new actors/actress breathing life into new character, making them unique & memorable.Looking forward to season 2.",10
"My family absolutely LOVE the Addams Family. However i'm not as big a fan as them, but i absolutely loved this show.Jenna Ortega was 100% the best person for this, every role she plays is perfect.Tim did an amazing job with everything: the costumes, the camera work, the characters depth and improvement, the plot twists everything is on point.And the fact that the original Wednesday Addams is in the movie (the redhead normie teacher) makes it even better.The fact that Wednesday never blinked in the entire show is amazing acting, Jenna really outdid herself with this.Even the side characters have you gripped into the story.",9
"I have never done a review before, but this series is so good I've felt the need.Wednesday is witty, clever and resourceful. I'm in awe of how this series has been funny yet inspiring for many young girls and I hope it inspires girls to be more independent and trust themselves.I have literally loved every single minute of this series and I'm about to watch it again already.The music and instrumental incorporation is the icing on the cake, I can't praise this enough.I won't give any spoilers away but the cello solo towards of the end of the first episode absolutely mesmerised me.Please give the green light for the second season as I'm dying for more!",10
"I expected this to be another typical failed reboot full of identity politics beating viewers over the head. There is some of it to be sure, but it was minimal and tolerable.My main complaint is Gomez felt miscast. I read that Tim Burton wanted to cast a shorter fatter actor as this was how the character was originally written. Luis Guzman is a great character actor when playing gangsters, but the hoodrat vibes just felt out of place. Also uncle Fester was annoying. For some reason he was portrayed as jewish saying things like ""oy vey"". It made no sense.Those things aside, it was a joy to watch the actress playing Wednesday and her deadpan delivery.",8
"First off we go from Raul Julia to some fat ugly guy for Gomez. This is just wrong. You are supposed to believe that Gomez and Morticia are madly in love, not in some twisted guilt ridden relationship based on something horrible that happened when they were in school. Gomez has always been played by athletic, good looking and suave men who you can believe would land an incredible woman like Morticia. Not some fat slothful looser who looks like he will pass out from climbing a flight of stairs.Second, Pugsley is not some weak child. He isn't a victim type who gets bullied. He is tougher than that. He isn't insecure or mewling. He has Wednesday for an older sister. Bullies should run from him in terror.This is the big issue I see with this show, the men have all been castrated and are waiting for women to tell them what to do. Blech.",1
"Because while I liked it I didn't love it! This would have been something I would of liked to take my daughter to see when she was a tween, I didn't really like how any of the Adams were cast whilst Catherine Zeta Jones looked amazing she was hit or miss in her acting. I love Luis Guzman but don't think that was a part he was really suited for and the guy who played uncle Fester( don't know his name) was awful! And as for Wednesday(Jenna Ortega) I wasn't thrilled with her! Her acting is very one note. Christina Rcci was much better as was the cast of the 90's movie. Any ways this was entertaining enough. The costumes, filming etc was done well and I did enjoy it. It's a decent watch for the evening and much better than most of the recent series releases on netflix.",7
"Things have not been great from the Netflix camp of late, so wasn't sure what to expect, but have to say Tim Burtons 'Wednesday' has certainly given me hope that we may see some actual series worth watching on it once more. It was funny, emotional, dark and really good fun. Let's hope Tim Burton stays on board for the 2nd series (which there definitely will be, but wont spoil things if mot watched it yet) because I will definitely be watching it. The actress who played Wednesday was the perfect actress to play the part and the CGI for Thing was just superb. Personally I don't think I would have picked Catherine Zeta Jones as Morticia, but will let that slide, because of everyone else's fantastic performances.",9
"The list of genres for this production should include ""mystery"" as the first one. This show is a crazy fun time and, while the family saw only two shows on Thanksgiving Day, my wife and myself binged the entire eight episodes on our own.Typically Tim Burton is known for his odd take on cinema and this work is simply superb...most everything seems plausible regardless of how it's portrayed.Excellent screenplay. Excellent acting. The entire production team should be awarded Oscars.Jenna Ortega is priceless and has captured her character Wednesday perfectly. Her demeanor reminds me of Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator.",8
"Without Jenny Ortegas performance as Wednesday, there would be little to recommend other then a semi interesting central mystery. The rest of the show is insufferable characters like Wednesdays roommate, Xavier, and Tyler. Watching Tyler act makes my eyes and ears bleed.When the central mystery is not the main focus, we have to suffer through the typical YA teen agnst drama. The target audience for this show will soak it up. If you ever thought Riverdale was a good show you will be right at home here. Hence the 8.5 on imdb.Wednesday might as well be another CW show, rotten tomatoes said it the best. If CW type drama, writing, characters is your thing you will love Wendesday. To each their own. I prefer a little bit more substance in my television shows.",5
"Didn't know what to expect. Vague memories of the reruns of the original show when I was very young. Think I saw the first movie with because of my little sisters and was never a fan. Put this on because I was bored. It is absolutely brilliant. Each character is fully realised and Wednesday is fantastic. Yes, I knew who the baddies were by the 5th episode but it didn't matter because I believe it was intentional as the writers were continuing to so us that Wednesday was very intelligent and mature but also cocky and naive too. Very well done.How this show could come from the crap origins I remember is a testament to the writers and producers. Applause all round. Watch it!",10
"I knew I was going to like this reincarnated version of Charles Addams' story of Wednesday during the series' first episode when Jenna Ortega, as the titular teen states: ""I find social media to be a soul-sucking void of meaningless affirmation."" She'll get no argument from me on that point. Apparently (and I hadn't known this), Tim Burton was the director originally attached (as they say in the ""business known as show"") to The Addams Family movies, but couldn't make it work with his Batman movies' post-production schedules. I don't know if the eventual director, Barry Sonnenfeld, was 100% responsible for the original casting of Christina Ricci, or if Burton had a role (he would use her in later films like ""Sleepy Hollow""), but the young actress created a memorable if not iconic character in two films. And she gets a nice, if light supporting role here. So why this series? Well it's now literally a new generation with an updated sense of cynicism and sarcasm, plus we've got to give Tim Burton his time at bat, don't we? He doesn't disappoint. And neither does Jenna Ortega's turn in the role of Wednesday (Full of Woe) Addams. I refer you to the dance scene in episode four. Memorable, once again. If I could award halfs, then the series would be 8.5/10 stars.",8
"I loved this show- I really did, but I also did not appreciate all the liberal micro aggressions . It's too bad that all the new shows and movies that are made these days always have to have left liberals and their loonatic microagressive propaganda. So much is lost with the passive aggressive slips that take away from what could be awesome and wonderful to watch. There were so many things I really enjoyed about this series- but alas, too much was dedicated to the liberals and their demise of wellness. Sad that this is the new truth, but maybe someday it will get old and people can get over their agendas and go back to making good movies and shows.",5
"Omg! I have been excited about this series for a few months and I was sooooo happy when it dropped on Netflix on Wednesday. I grew up watching different versions of the Addams Family and I of course love love the one with Christina Ricci in it. How cool was it that she's one of the main stars in this series!. Good to see Catherine Zeta-Jones and Luis Guzmàn, Gwendoline Christie from Game of Thrones always great to see her in character. Jenna Ortega was greatt playing Wednesday Addams!!. I liked the who school theme, Bianca was my 2nd favorite character. I'm 37 and I really enjoyed this. S2 please!!",10
"As my first experience with any addams family work it was a great start, the series is super fun and addictive, you can't stop watching, endearing and relatable people, fun story, although in the last 4 episodes the quality has dropped a bit little, great direction by Tim Burton with an amazing finale with many reveals and an absurdly good final episode, and a cliffhanger at the end of the series for more seasons [The end. ?""songs, comedy, wednesday being cold, gothic and dark brighten my 7 hours of consumption of the series, along with several cool characters, Emma Myers as Enid was excellent, in addition to the entire cast that was incredible, very good series!",8
"I cannot describe how in love I am with the whole story line, concept and actors. This is hands down one of the best shows I have watched in a long time and I really need more seasons. It's a totally new and fresh idea, which is literally suitable for so many age ranges to watch - I binged the whole show in 2 days! Best show on Netflix at the moment and definitely will be for a long time! It's like the movie but a million times better, with new in depth characters and stories! I really do hope they renew it for a new season and soon because I cannot wait!! A must watch for anyone wanting something new to binge!",10
"Told from the start to the end, not 2 episodes of story and 6 episodes of flashbacks and backstories, not drawn out, not artifically stretched and convoluted, just a story with lovable characters, mixing the Addams lore with a huge chunk of Harry Potter and another one right from the old vampire slayer Buffy.I normally hate high school drama and the endless parade of 25-30 year old ""teenagers"" that have completely taken over every genre I used to like, so I'm positively surprised by this, especially since I've grown to fear overblown marketed series, but not just Burton and Elfman and the all-star ensemble deliver, but pretty much everyone on the set and behind it.Is it the bestest thing ever? Well, the bestest thing in this category for a while at least. It's funny, full of little twists, a little scary, quite mysterious and never really what you would expect, which is exactly what you'd expect from something with the Addams name.",9
I don't even know why bother using the Addams family if all they wanted to make was yet another teen mystery drama.Netflix used their old bad recipe once again and they basically ticked all the boxes for a tv show that covers every genres.It's a teen murder mystery comedy romance fantasy paranormal superpowers drama tv show with a sparkle of martial arts and sword combat. Everything is so bad the only very good thing is Jenna Ortega acting and I am sure she will have a bright future. Wished she didn't had to do this as her first main cast role.Just watch it and forget it. People watched this garbage just because Tim Burton's name is on it.,4
"I really love this show! It's hard to top Christina Ricci as Wednesday Addams but Jenna Ortega is amazing! She really nails Wednesday and she could carry this show all on her own. Fortunately, she doesn't have to because the rest of the cast is also great. Emma Myers is sure to be a breakout star from this show. Not since Willow in the original Buffy has there been such a wonderful ""sidekick."" Gwendoline Christie, Riki Lindhome, Joy Sunday, and Christina Ricci herself really make this show work as well.The writing and pacing of this show are perfect, too. Everything moves along at a brisk pace and you never want to stop watching. I really hope there is a season 2! Make it happen Netflix! You've struck gold with this show!",9
"I'm not an especially fervent fan of the Addams Family so won't hold it against this spinoff that it doesn't follow its predecessor material 100% faithfully. However, it does seem to make some fundamental errors that go against the core of the Addams appeal. Firstly, a lot of the charm of the Addams' is them being unaware of how bizarre and frightening their macabre interests and lifestyle are to the people they encounter. To that end, Wednesday has too few such moments of juxtaposition and almost none of the Addams quirkiness is met with anything more than a quizzical look. That is partly down to the Addams feeling a bit watered down in this spinoff, but is mostly due to a bigger problem the series has: it's choice of world. Choosing to have the show take place in a school full of supernatural characters much of who are weirder & arguably more interesting than the Addams robs Wednesday of a lot of her uniquity. Where the Addams could previously shine against human foes, being a bit goth around actual vampires, werewolves and sirens seems a bit underwhelming.The series then also weirdly seems to forget that the show should be about Wednesday, and instead becomes a run-of-the-mill supernatural detective story that wouldn't seem out of place in half a dozen other series. You can replace Wednesday with any other character and the storyline wouldn't change much. Wednesday feels like a supporting character in someone else's mystery. Laurel Gates (not an established villain of the Addams) has come back to Jericho to exact revenge on the people she feels took everything from her family. She uses a Hyde to carry out her murderous plan which involves killing a coroner and mayor involved in a coverup, and destroying the school of outcasts that her family spent their lives fighting against. None of this really involves the Addams. There's a loose connection that's tried to be established - Laurel's brother was in love with Morticia and when tasked by his father to poison the school of outcasts, he instead goes after Gomez in a jealous rage and dies in the ensuing fight. It's quite a weak attempt to shoehorn the Addams into this mystery and the series itself seems to know this as Gates vs Addams isn't really the focus of the conflict, it's more Gates vs Nevermore. This becomes even more apparent when you consider that Laurel started her plan of revenge about a year before Wednesday was unexpectedly sent to Nevermore and so her plan wouldn't have involved the Addams at all.Lastly, the series throws in some tiresome modern social politics that all shows nowadays can't seem to help themselves doing. It's a bit too on the nose most times. When Xavier offers some advice to Wednesday about her visions, she says he's ""mansplaining"" them to her - visions she admits she only started having a couple months prior and doesn't know when they happen or how to control them, and Xavier's advice was coming from his dad who had been living with visions for decades. But sure, let's just tell him he's mansplaining. Enid's struggle with not having become a werewolf takes on a not-so-subtle parallel to gender identity when her mother suggests she goes for ""lycanthropy conversion therapy camps"". I don't know what it is about modern writers but they can't seem to get across admirable messages of acceptance, overcoming adversity, defying expectations etc without it coming across as preachy, jarring or having to put another group down in the process.The rest of the Addams, though they have little screen time, leave a bit to be desired. Pugsley is for some reason weak and defenseless when he should be just as intimidating and frightening to 'normies' as Wednesday is. Catherine Zeta Jones and Luis Guzman also just don't have the chemistry to match up to the iconic duo of Angelica Huston and Raul Julia.Jenna Ortega however does a sterling job as Wednesday; her delivery and timing is spot on but the script still somehow makes her feel tragically underutilized in a series that should be about her. Thing is excellently done and is probably the best portrayal of the character yet. The soundtrack is also commendable, in particular instrumental versions of Nothing Else Matters and Paint it, Black are superb. Gwendolyn Christie is also very enjoyable as an antagonist to Wednesday though succumbs to a cliched end.I overall still enjoyed the season, my few gripes don't detract too much from the positives and I'd be happy if a season 2 was announced.",7
"Forced, hard to watch, and cringy. Could not even get through the first episode. I loved the movies as a child, but this series does not resemble the originals at all. I am not sure how people love it and give it such high ratings. Morticia and Gomez have no chemistry. Gomez was always very charming but in this, he is just creepy, and not in a good way. I agree with the others who said the values which bonded together the family in the original are missing here. It is under the ""comedy"" genre which puzzles me.When I saw the trailer, I was already skeptical and it saddens me that the outcome is even worse than expected.",1
Jenna Ortegas extraordinary acting and the story are great in this show. The rest was kinda meh. Maybe would not watch it again but don't regret it. About the story: slowish on the first episodes but gets better towards the end. Loved the plot twist about the gates girl and her not being the obvious one. Some of the characters were definitely a bit childish and not the best. The Hyde was not at the expected level of sfx in my opinion. Directing was very recognizable Burtons work which I truly admire. Jenna Ortegas portrayal of Wednesday Addams was very good and somehow felt natural from the start. The back story was ok with the whole Gomez murder thing and whatnot.,6
"These days it's pretty rare for a series this good to come around.Ortega plays Wednesday to perfection and it is surprisingly refreshing to see the character get more in depth, because let's be honest Wednesday was just a side character in the classic movies.This series succeeded every expectation of mine, which were very high. It's heartwarming to see that such a cult classic got such a good treatment.Tim Burton's style is present as expected and fits the series perfectly.I hope this Serie gets more seasons, but I'm almost certain it will when I look at the overwhelming feedback.Cheers to Netflix, I almost lost hope in you, but here you are giving me one of my favorite series in years!",10
"Great adaption of the Adams family.Keeping Wednesday in character must've been a major challenge, which they mastered quite well.This time not a macabre comedy, but a black detective.They managed to keep the Adams vibe quite well. The story keeps you on your toes, while being amused by the macabre.Jenna plays her role as Wednesday very well. Thing plays a typical supportive role. Festers part is short bit fitting.Home's and Morticia's roles are a less convincing. They feel like ""forced into character"". Catherine seems visually fitting. But something is missing. For those who know the original comedies, Luis may not feel like a good choice for the role of Gomez.But their roles are limited and it doesn't really break the vibe.I enjoyed it very much and hope to see a fitting 2nd season.",9
"I think the only way you could enjoy this series is if you had never seen the Addams Family movie or older series. Because if you had you could not help but be massively disappointed in this new show. It has lost all of the charm, warmth and wit of the previous show and movie and completely dismantled the original family dynamic. In this new series, they have completely trashed what made the original so wonderful - their love and support of each other and how they embraced and cherished their ""weirdness"".This show does none of that. Now I read through many 8, 9, and 10 star reviews and if they are legitimate reviews then I am happy so many enjoy this show. But I find those that rated it around 4, 5, and 6 stars seem more in touch with the reality that this show misses the mark in many areas.So if you like it, that is great! I might too if I wasn't so aware of how much they changed thing around in this version, and not for the better in my opinion.",8
"I can't give this show less than 8 stars because honestly, it deserves 10 stars. The plot is very interesting and keeps the viewer invested. I enjoyed the mystery and Wednesday's pursuit of the truth around the school, and even the more ""slice of life"" moments like her having to find a club or the competition. Wednesday's actress portrays her exactly as I would hope,But the romance plot line broke my immersion and honestly just left me feeling irritated. The love interests are incredibly boring outside of the mystery around them. Except for his importance to the mystery, Xavier felt like your typical bland and overdone misunderstood artist. Tyler was the usually pretty boy with a dead mom and unsupportive dad that you see in a lot of stories. Every romantically charged scene made me groan and overall ruined my enjoyment of the series. Yes, it all lead up to a very interesting plot twist, but that doesn't change how badly it effected my viewing experience.I feel like there could be a better way to work the story to avoid a forced story, or even to rework the characters to where they'd be more viable love interests for Wednesday. But aside from my gripes with that aspect of the show, it was a fantastic watch and a very gripping story.",8
Tim never fails to impress and I just couldn't get enough of Wednesday! I'll be waiting and praying for a second season for sure. Thank you Tim for the best show of 2022 you really checked all the boxes with this one. No spoilers here but if you're into dark comedy's this is the show for you. Left me on the edge of my seat and wanting more from the first episode to the last. I never write reviews but this one was worth taking the time to give a 10/10. I haven't been impressed by much the last two years show wise but this was as I said superb! Gratitude is all I have. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!,10
"When I saw Wednesday pop up on Netflix, I kinda though it is gonna be another Witcher - Buy IP, bend it over, milk it and ruin it. But no. It was really enjoyable ride with great new characters and a pretty good take on the Addams family. The only thing I would say was subpar was Pugsley. He was much more timid and un-Addamsy than in other media, but it was handled pretty well. And for our protagonist? I adored her, she was capable, but not a Marry Sue. She was snarky and funny when needed and serious when it made sence. The plot is giant mystery that is kind of easy to guess, but the twist was well made regardless, because it made sence. It was not just a ""Dysney twist villain"" situacion.All and all, the actors were great, the plot was fun and intense, the score was amazing and it was really enjoyable!",9
"""When I look at you, the following three emojis come to mind:
Rope. Shovel. Hole.""Mayhem * Murder * Teenage Animal Angst : The macabre Addams Family franchise gets a fabulous new series, worthy of binge-watching any day.The diverse cast, headed by Jenna Ortega, keeps the action seamlessly flowing along, serving up snappy dialogue and enough plot twists to seduce viewers into a ""just one more episode"" happy trance.The creative team gives a smart homage to Edgar Allan Poe's Murders in the Rue Morgue, by featuring Wednesday as the relentless Generation Z Detective Dupin. And hopefully Tim Burton's credentials are sufficient enough to warrant a few more seasons.",10
"I find Jenna Ortega (Wednesday) portrayal of the character spot on. Uncle Fester was also well played by fred armisen. To be honest all characters are well played. But i must admit, there is a real liking for the character of Enid (Emma Myers) enid and wednesday work really well together and loved the ending of season 1? The way that enid kept trying to get wednesday. To show emotion was really well done, Everyone loves a hug. I didn't expect this show to be so good. , story was good monster was well done, camera. Work and visuals are spot on, this was a pleasure to watch.,and looking forward to the next season.",9
"So I have grown up with the Addams family watching both the cartoons and the movies.Loved both. This is a diffrent version not like the others. For first we follow only Wednesday not the other family members. I didn't like the other members they're were not like I growned up with. It felt liked the actors was doing a bad cosplay version of them.My favorite Addams character have always been Wednesday but this Wednesday was not the one I used to love. She did have some matching qualities but this Wednesday was a angsty teen most of the time.I didn't like they're trying to do a drama show of it. And the classic triangle romance drama is boring.Wednesday have said herself she doesn't want to be a housewife. I think she better of alone then in a relationship.I would have liked the series better if it wasn't the Addams in it. It's like they took the Addams family and throw in harry potter, twilight and sabrina.I loved Christina ricci and Gwendoline. The Thing was the most fun and thats saying a lot.",7
"Jenna Ortega just isn't Wednesday. From the old series to the movies, Addams family always had convincing actors. Christina Ricci was just excellent as Wednesday. Jenna Ortega just isn't, she is too smooth, too normal. Also all other known characters simply do not convinceAlso Addams is about over-the-top humor, and although it starts well with the piranha's, after that it is just never any fun and lots over personal issues and basic suspense.Can't imagine this is done by Tim Burton, it lacks his style and quality. The storyline of often illogical and the dialogues unnatural. So I guess he's lending his name while having a trainee do the work, or something like that.",4
"While this is a series that feels aimed at teenagers.. the high quality production, sets and clothing, excellent camerawork, great pacing and a good execution of a simple murder mystery plot driven by an interesting character in an equally intriguing setting make for a generally entertaining series that anyone (that has 8 or so hours) can enjoy. It does remind of that latest ""Chilling Adventures of Sabrina"" series, down to the tone and romance woes.. as well as early Harry Potter movies' villain uncertainty and a tad of Riverdale (what I know about it from osmosis).The story as a whole is a bit tried and done.. and sadly, falls quickly into expectations.But the ""Addams Family"" connection gives it some leeway to unwrap itself differently and generate an identity worth pursuing.. even if the character Wednesday acts like she should in some situations and contradicts her herself in others.. like wanting to stop bad things from happening, you know, the core of the series. Personally, I don't crave their weird-charm (though, I do enjoy a good game of Gloom).. but it if is well executed, I can appreciate anything in any coat of paint. Not to mention the fact that Jenna does a fantastic job at continuing the mantle left by the talented Christina Ricci. Whom was a surprise to see again.. though, I had some expectations for her assigned character that were not off the mark. Beyond her, I enjoyed seeing Gwendoline Christie in another great role (an Actor that should get more roles), and I hope Emma Myers gets more attention after this.It's an easy watch, although I thought it could have been ANYTHING else besides the Addams, like a new adaptation of Mattel's Monster High.",6
"I liked the cast. All of them. Characters and actors alike. Which is rare, especially among the recent products of Hollywood. I jumped into the show with little to no expectations, knowing it was just another ""Netflix remake"", and was greatly surprised. It didn't just use the name of a known franchise to capitalize on it. This was Addams Family. Well, mostly one of them, but still true to the original premise. The series reminded me a lot of Harry Potter: an earie school for ""unnormies"" with mysteries, secrets, rivalries, and monsters. With a healthy dose of Tim Burton flavour. Loved it. I'm down for another season. Hope it does well.",9
"I wanted this to be a good new series for me. When i heard catharine zeta jones was going to be morticia, i was excited.She gets one of the stars, she was good. But only in 2 episodes. What. Gomez was good. 2 episodes. Uncle fester (not a fan of the actor, but the character) 1 episode.I get it, i get it, it is called Wednesday, it's not about the rest of them. That's the problem though. She needs the rest of them to work. Her relationship with her brother for example works.Here, she is just rude, unpleasant and doesnt work. She isn't likeable. So as your main character, that's not good. I get they thought her ""witty"" responses were funny, but they werent.It's why Wednesday only works as part of the family, not the main character. It's too much of the same.And dont get me started on werewolves, sirens etc.Just keep her with the family, keep her as the main character if you want, but have the rest as side characters helping her through her life etc.Oh and the other 2 stars are for the original and best Wednesday - Christina Ricci.",3
"You just have to love it. Everything. From the cast, to the plot, the camerawork, absolutely everything! Wednesday is going to remain a great show for decades, that's for sure. Also, everybody loves Thing, it is a whole mood. So playful and funny! The morbid scenes are the right amount of frightening, you have laughter, crying, tension, love, hatred, teenage problems and more serious ones. It is quite inevitable not enjoying all kind of feelings mixed up armoniously. Everything is matching, making things that need to stand out to really catch your eye. It was expected to receive such a work of art coming from the well-known Tim Burton but this show exceeded expectations in the best ways possible!",10
"I had no expectations on this show. Was I ever blown away! I've never been a big Addams Family fan but this show was fantastic!! I hope they do a second season!! I can hardly wait for it. Tim Burton I am a fan of as I like most of his work...Nightmare Before Christmas, Edward Scissor Hands, Corpse Bride....to name a few. All excellent films...so when I saw he produced this I had to check it out. I was not disappointed in the slightest. If you are a Tim Burton fan, Addams Family fan or both then this is a must watch!! You will not regret it. The second season if renewed can not come soon enough.",8
"I found that this was definitely one of the better Netflix series I've seen. The camera work and colours chosen throughout was sublime ! The casting director done a damn good job as the actors played and executed their parts perfectly. The script was excellent honestly I was hooked throughout !. The only fault I really have about the series is I wish there was more episodes to watch ! I don't want to give to much away but I highly doubt you'll be disappointed if you decide to give this a go !It's also one of those shows you get so in to , it will probably only take you a day or 2 to finish. Hoping for a season 2 !Enjoy !",10
"Exceeded my expectations! Kathrenine Zetta Jones is an almost Morticia we dreamt of, Luis Guzman is almost on par with Raul Julia (almost) but Jenna Ortega is simply stunning. This is the Wednesday I expected to experience as a teenager. To me these 8 episodes have been a smash, hope season two comes quickly!Also a few characters from the original theme come alive:LurchUncle FesterThe thing (amazing adaptation and effects)Story is as challenging as what one would expect from an Adams family adaptation.I really can't anticipate what to expect from the second season.Don't you dare not have one!!!!",9
"Usually Netflix originals are compete drivel, and unfortunately Tim Burton hasn't been on his game for at least a decade but this was great fun.You're endeared to Wednesday perhaps even more so than in other adaptations, Jenna Ortega did a great job, as did the rest of the cast. Lots of misdirects to keep you guessing and no lazy writing to pander to the usual Netflix crowd.The character development for the main cast was great, everybody got their moment.Frightening & violent enough to make it feel naughty for kids to watch (very in keeping withe Addams feel) whilst keeping it interesting for adults too.There are enough nods to the source material and ealier adaptation that it'll keep older fans happy, but it is definitely it's own thing.Got a long wait for S2 now!",8
"When I first heard of Wednesday I knew it was something that I had to check out. I am very glad I did. Wednesday is a show that will be sure to keep you entertained and wanting more. I found myself binging the show and was pulled into the story from episode one. If you're looking for a dark comedy show or just looking to try something new, I would highly recommend this show. Jenna Ortega does an amazing job on capturing the vibe of Wednesday and is definitely worth the watch alone. All the other cast members did an excellent job as well. I will be waiting and hoping for a season two announcement from Netflix to further entertain us with the fun and interesting adventures of Wednesday.",10
"Tim Burton is a Masterful! & A Cinematic Genius! This series is and was creative, fresh, intense and artistically articulate. I could not stop watching after the first episode and I binged this series in two days! I can not wait for season two. The collaboration between Netflix and Burton is explosive. As one who grew up watching the television series The Adam's Family in the late 60's early 70's! This was a grand slam! The writing is amazing! The cast is superb, leaving little to no room for you not to simply be totally emerged with each and every character. Jenna Ortega hands down is brilliant as Wednesday Adams, quirky, quick witted and cute, rolled up into one. Congratulations Netflix!!!",10
"I know I'm NOT the target audience, yet I went ahead and watched because Wednesday is one of the best true-to-themselves characters I've ever watched in shows and movies.The Good was exactly what I thought it'd be: Wednesday. The comebacks and brutal honesty are among the best parts of her character, and this series. Jenna Ortega is perfect regarding what the previous literature and screen adaptations of Wednesday have sought to be. She fails, time and again, but, while staying true to her selfish and lone-wolf roots, she continuously adapts to her situation, and even ""evolves"", not only her skills, but in the ability to trust others.She. Killed. It. I'll say it over and over again!The show's aesthetic and setting were great, too. The colors, contrasts, and costumes kept it light in saturation, but not too subtle to blend into the background.Now, the Bad. Unfortunately, it's another one of those Netflix/Hulu/CW/etc. Shows that has no redeemable white dudes (and almost no redeemable dudes in general). They're either villainous or incompetent, and tend to get in the way. It's a trend to try and force-feed or explain (no, not mansplain or womansplain, just explain) it to everyone who fits the above stereotype, but for those that don't fit into the agenda's crosshairs, there's a few reminders each episode that'll take you out of the immersive experience for a groan; And to those that do fit the agenda's sterotyping (leading to real-world racial-profiling), they most likely didn't watch the show, nor anything with the Addams family, probably. It'd be nice to have info regarding what groups this show is for/against. It'll never happen, but that would be nice for those that actually care.Also, Gomez ""look what they did to my boy"" Addams was a big whiff. Missing Raul Julia, and he is irreplaceable, but whether it was casting, writing, or chemistry, Luis Guzmán was cringe in the absence of charisma. In addition, Pugsley and Fester were letdowns. At least CZJ was a hit, but what wasn't was the writers' ideas to turn her into a remorseful and emotional wreck at times.Ortega carried (as expected), the setting was legit, the plot was predictable, and the supports were paper-thin as more copy-and-paste stereotypes to the subplot fodder.6/10.",6
"Half of the show is about Wednesday Adams and the other half is a copy of Home Before Dark.It's strength is in it's visuals (theme, color scheme, effects, etc.) and characters which made it always enjoyable to watch but it's investigation story is a Home Before Dark knock off, I would have rated it 8/10 if it had a stronger more original story.Wednesday dorms with her opposite, Enid, they keep getting boyfriends but the best relationship potential is right in front of us the whole time, Wednesday and Enid, I was disappointed the creators didn't take it further, was the greatest missed opportunity in the series.",7
"Not sure where to start, the characters are well written the story is well written, the visuals are very well executed, I went into this fully expecting it to be another 10 minute before turning off like many of the releases have been on all platforms of late, but no this had me hooked, it had my mind wandering towards how a scooby story should be written and executed ( unlike the future trash that is on its way) the throwbacks to the original Adams family and the films from the 90s were well placed and subtle, the casting was near on perfect, it's the first thing for a while I had no complaints. Disney Amazon netflix etc etc take note this is what you audience wants.",10
"This show is definitely worth watching
I thought it was so well done I've always secretly been a fan of Tim Burton's work it's mind blowing
And kooky I'm hopeful for a second season and I had a.feeling that Tyler was gonna end up being the monster i would definitely go to nevermore. Xavier is probably more my Type not Tyler because he's the Hyde. For the second season I hope Wednesday still plans to get the monster. And go back to nevermore for another semester. Thing too he's definitely my favorite other then Wednesday the scene of Wednesday dancing at the dance was so great and the principal dying i didn't really like her.",10
"Jenna Ortega is a mastermind. They could not have cast this show better. The plot, the aesthetic, everything was perfect. As a long time fan of the Addams family I was a little nervous for this one but I was hooked. This definitely did not disappoint! Another Tim Burton masterpiece to add to his collection. I wish the monster was a tad bit scarier but honestly it was fine the way it was. This is a creepy, fun show for the entire family. The only downside is I wanted more addams family time but all in all this show was fantastic! I binged watched it and I hope it renews so I can binge watch every season that follows!",9
"I really enjoyed this series. Jenna Ortega was spot on as Wednesday, in my opinion. She was sharp and witty and delivered her lines without so much as a smirk and I loved it.What I didn't quite understand was the relationship between Wednesday and Morticia. I am not a die-hard fan of the original Addams Family show or movies, but I did see several of them and don't remember the tension and strife between the two of them, but maybe I'm just not recalling properly.Overall, I can't wait for season 2 to come out. I hope that this series ends up having a few seasons. I'm excited to see what is next at Nevermore!",9
"I am 40 yrs old and have never watched any Addams Family movies, but I know the basic premise of the family's story. I don't have any kids of my own, but I am somewhat of a TV expert...some may consider me a bit of an addict. ??With that said, ""Wednesday"" was one of the best and most well done shows I've seen in ages. I was fully immersed in the world of Nevermore from the first scene. I loved everything about it...the style, writing (especially witty one-liners), characters, suspense, mystery...you name it, it had it all! I can normally guess how a show will end based on how it's edited...but not this time! It kept me guessing until pretty much the very end. I never thought I'd feel this way about this type of show, but trust me, you won't want to stop watching...and you will be super sad when it's over! I just finished it and felt compelled to immediately get on here and write this review, bc I want EVERYONE to experience what I just did while watching it. Pure amusement and joy!Now get off of your phone and go watch it...you won't be sorry!",10
"I literally finish this in two days. The story was brilliant, and kept me guessing the whole time. I'm usually one of those people who can figure out mysteries pretty quickly. This one took me longer than most. Jenna Ortega IS Wednesday Addams. Christina Ricci has been succeeded by a beautifully dedicated and amazing actress. Jenna captured everything that we love about Wednesday. The creepiness, black heart, and dry humor are all there but it also comes with warm and caring for others.Some don't like Morticia and Wednesday not getting along. But I think it's just a teenager budding heads with her mother. Just because Wednesday and Morticia are goth doesn't mean teenage angst wouldn't follow them. I think with future seasons we'll see more kinship between the two. And we BETTER get more seasons, Netflix.",9
"Wow, that was about 13% of what I was expecting. I certainly didn't expect the lovechild of Anya Taylor-Joy and Seven of Nine to be the next Wednesday.Eh, it was so-so. Of course, it was beautifully shot, scored and acted - all that was to be expected. I just didn't see why it needed to be 8 episodes. This could've easily just been a two-hour, stand-alone film.The title teen Addams is transferred to yet another school after, gasp, misbehaving and just think of it as a very, very scaled down Hogwarts. And just like Harry Potter, there are plenty of mysteries to solve before the end of the school year.While I didn't mind the casting at all, in fact, Catherine Zeta-Jones looked amazing and Jenna Ortega as Wednesday did good for the most part, I just thought they lacked chemistry as a family and I thoroughly didn't like this disjointed version of the Addams Family. Naturally anyone, including me right now, will compare this to the OG 90s duo (excluding the 3rd one.) I not only liked those first two films better than this whole season, but I even liked the 2019 animated movie more as well.Would I recommend? Eh, maybe. I didn't hate it and I did manage to stay through all 8 episodes with the first and last ones being the best ones. I won't watch any more. I prefer just to stick with the 90s classics.***Final Thoughts: Yeah, yeah, I'm beating myself up that it took me over an hour to figure out that side character is Christina Ricci.",5
"This is basically the Addams family version of Nancy Drew. With that said, I was always a huge fan of Nancy Drew. I thought I would give it a chance and ended up binging it over three days. Good character development, twists and turns, and true to the Addams family feel and quirkiness. The actor who plays thing is excellent, incredible how he portrays a wide range of emotion. Several well-known actors also play characters, which was fun and a nice surprise. The mystery had you going in many different directions as to who was the perpetrator and it was wrapped up nicely with no loose ends. My only suggestion would be to have had more of the Addams family members incorporated in the plot. Hope they are working on season two.",8
"There is clearly no understanding of the source material or what made the Addams Family such a beloved name. Everything at the core of the movies and shows is not in this series. There is no comedy or wittyness, it's all poorly written cringy, cliche, 'teen' dialogue. The weirdness of the family is completely muted because of the world being supernatural some reason. All the characters feel off. It doesn't feel cohesive.It's basically taking the worst of Riverdale, mixing some Harry Potter, and naming characters after the Addams Family characters. There is no reason for this to be tied to the brand. There was little to no effort done to make this a ""Addams Family"" show. On top of this, It's there has already been a show based on Wednesday before. By a YouTuber. Who not only did a better job made but understood the material a lot better. It's embarrassing that having so many people and such a massive budget produces such poor results.This would have been fine otherwise, but dragging a beloved IP into this lazy ""re-imagining'"", doesn't deserve anything past a single star. I'd give it half that if I could. I have nothing wrong with reboots as long as the spirit of the original is maintained. But this.... Do better.",1
"As a kid I loved the original TV series of the Addams Family, and the 2 films were entertaining enough without ever living up to the TV Series. Wednesday Adams was always my favourite character, the sweet looking girl with a love of the macabre. Christina Ricci was standout in the films and for my money nailed the character. It was great to see her given a significant supporting role in this film but not at the expense of Wednesday being front and centre.When I saw this trailed I had high hopes and I have not been disappointed, if anything my expectations have been exceeded. In essence the original Addams Family series and the films are a succession of short sketches to play with the kooky and macabre for fun and laughs. Here we get a much deeper nuanced exploration of one of the characters outside of the family unit. This doesn't come at the expense of the fun, with lashings of Tim Burton's trademark dark humour thrown in for good measure.The series is expertly paced, without any weak episodes. The mystery and drama keeps you guessing while the dark humour is playfully woven around the main plot with plenty of nods to the originals and to horror film tropes in general.I have a minor gripe that stops me giving this 10 stars and that is Gomez and Morticia. While only playing minor roles in the story Gomez is portrayed as meek and subservient to Morticia and it grated with me a little as in every other version Gomes is a dynamic character in a relationship of equals with Morticia. This isn't a reflection on the performances of Luis Guzman and Catherine Zeta Jones who hold their own amongst a host of fine performances.Special mention goes to Gwendoline Christie who is imperious as Principal Weems, and especially Emma Myers as Enid, the day to Wednesday's night. The interplay and the developing relationship between Enid and Wednesday is one of the highlights of the series, as without Enid we wouldn't get to explore Wednesday's personality as deeply as we do. What we see here is a more grown up Wednesday than the ghoulish child we have seen before and so we don't have to worry about comparisons about who is your favourite Wednesday. They are different but the same if that makes sense.None of this would matter if Wednesday herself isn't front and centre. Jenna Ortega is simply magnificent as Wednesday. From the first moment she is on screen, you only see her from behind, and you immediately know she just is Wednesday. It is not just her expression but the whole way she holds herself, the way she walks, and then there is the eyes that tell you everything. The standout moment is the school dance.Everything you would want from Wednesday is delivered and then a few extra layers you don't know you wanted are added as a bonus.The series ends with a not so subtle hint that there could be more. I expect that viewing figures will determine that. I hope there is, but it would have to be Jenna Ortega, nobody else can play this version of Wednesday now. Christine Ricci owns the young version, Jenna Ortega own this older version.",9
"I am not a great writer. This serial had me caught from the start. The actors, music, costumes perfect. Tim Burton at his best. An absolute Must see!!How to fill 600 characters? Usually I only write reviews when something is very bad, or very good. I really love this show and hope next season will be as good as the first. I love the macabre and I believe the main actrice will go far. This show gives me hope for Netflix in general. This show could become great, please don't mess up Season 2, where is Johnny Depp, this is a Tim Burton Movie after all. Johnny where are you ? You will come in Season 2 for sure.This show gets from me a solid 10.",10
"Enjoyed the show very much. Wish there were more episodes, but also glad they didn't put too much filler in. Hopefully there will be a second season. Catherine Zeta Jones made a pretty good Morticia but Angelica Huston is still my favorite. Luis Guzman was not right fit Gomez though. He is more comedy that debonaire and to me doesn't compare to Raul Julia. Jenna Ortega was good at not emoting with her face and just using her eyes. I loved that Christina Ricci had a role too. I did not know that Wednesday was an aspiring crime novelist and the way it was worked into the plot was perfect but easy enough to figure out.",8
"Wow! I was blown away! I fell in love with most pf the characters!! They had that Hogwarts, wanna eat em up appeal! Wednesday was phenomenal! Morticia! Love her! I always love Luis Guzman and of course he did a great job here. I guess we have to expect Tim Burton have his quirky weird ideas. I was a little put out in that being maybe the biggest watcher of Addams Family ever, my kids even looked like and pretended to be Wednesday and Pugsley at one point and my beloved dog was named Sonny Gomez, usually called Gomez or Gomey because he looked like Raul Julia! So handsome! FurLove of my life! Well, Luis Guzman grows on you anyway. And thankfully this is mostly about Wednesday who was amazing! She cracked me up so much! Typically atypical teenage girl!Gwendoline Christie was delicious!! I hope they find a way to resurrect her for more episodes! Now that we are spoiled! Great casting all around!I guess I will stop here because I don't want to spoil anything. I never expected to cry, in a good way, from a Tim Burton movie. This is richer and fuller. Well done! I am really curious about his process and how he went from making such kitchy and kind of silly movies to making something with so much heart. That could be a great story in itself!",10
"I'm not sure what I expected but this is one of the best series Netflix has. It's a great mix of comedy, creepy, nostalgia and the graphics music etc are all entertaining. This is a home run for Netflix.Jenna Ortega nails this role. I'm not sure that's good for Catherine Zeta Jones though. Here's the deal about the 'Family' (and I get that the show needs Wednesday to be strongest but).... Anjelica Huston Was legit the BEST morticia since the original on tv. But Catherine doesn't have that morticia Adam's feel. Luiz Guzman doesn't feel like Gomez. I'm just not feeling him and the kid playing Pugsley def isn't a fit. The other actors and actresses in the series are GREAT. Like legit everyone. In addition to Jenna- The actress from Game of Thrones who plays the head of the school is SO good. Her name escapes me at the moment but she's great. The two boys that like Wednesday and her have a really interesting and strong chemistry too. The actress playing her school dorm mate is really good too. Christina Ricci is great too but oddly looks like an older wednesday lol. All the other cast of characters- on point.I really am surprised by the entire thing and really found myself enjoying it. Thanks to Netflix and they need to keep this one going a free seasons. It's like one of their best series.",10
"I have watched three episodes and doubt that I will watch the remining ones.I realized the show was mainly about Wednesday, but not ALL about Wednesday. The one little, short scene with the rest of the family was fun and gave me the idea the whole family would be involved.The character of Wednesday is sullen to the point it is hard to like her or even be interested in her, and certainly not entertained.The story has gotten boring without much of a plot to it. I may try to watch some more of it later - but I sort of doubt it.It is hard to make a review that requires so many required characters.",3
"8-episode series from Netflix and executive producer Tim Burton, who also directed the first four episodes (each about 45mns in length), which sees Charles Addams' morbid curiosity Wednesday Addams being shipped off to boarding school after being expelled from her latest public high school after putting piranhas in the swimming pool. In the first episode, Wednesday (Jenna Ortega) plots her escape from her Gothic confines, but all that is soon dropped (along with her therapy sessions) once Thing arrives to help our heroine adjust to her new surroundings, which includes a secret sect of teenagers--""Outcasts"" who have tapped and untapped supernatural powers--and unraveling the mystery of father Gomez's criminal past. There's also a monster tearing apart travelers in the nearby woods (one that leaves behind human footprints) and artwork from a mysterious book which appears to depict Wednesday herself in a fiery confrontation with a tall pilgrim. I hoped to detect some of Burton's sly humor in evidence here, but this series is needlessly overrun by boring teenage bullies (including in a flashback!) and a lachrymose sheriff (Jamie McShane) who keeps popping up like a bad penny but who never really accomplishes anything useful. Like most of the characters in ""Wednesday"", the sheriff is a plot function: he's there to move scenes along rather than to take a part in the action. Ortega is certainly well-cast (as is Christina Ricci, the '90s version of Wednesday, as a teacher at the school), but she has to carry this weighty thing a long way. The finale, a showdown between Wednesday and two villains plus another fight between CGI monsters (one of them Wednesday's ditzy roommate, who suddenly finds her true self as a werewolf) is pure hogwash, one in which Wednesday is unceremoniously dragged into the 21st century by getting her own iPhone!",5
"I grew up with the awful Addams family cartoon airing on Cartoon Network and never really liked it that much, except for the character Wednesday. The same goes for the movie from 1991. So having some reference material I feel somewhat conflicted about this series and that's got mainly to do with the main character. I liked Wednesday at the beginning of this series but that feeling went went averse the closer I got to the end of the first season. She just doesn't seem genuine... for an Addams. I won't give away any spoilers but her acts throughout the episodes are conflicting the character she pretends to be. Now she just seems a teenager with Asperger syndrome rather than being a psychopath. I get it you know. They wanted to give the character Wednesday a bit more depth in her personality since a TV series runs longer than a movie but doing it the way they did it, didn't work for me.Speaking about characters. The other students at Nevermore Academy seem to be a bunch of dweebs and because of that I started to think who is this show for? I don't mind some teenage drama but this show is just filled with it in it's most simplistic form. Unfortunately it also includes the nowadays typical 'modern' inclusion propaganda that it could've gone without.It's not all bad though. The main storyline was entertaining although it got a bit boring while nearing the ending. Some details just didn't seem to match up making it sloppy. For me the thing that I perhaps liked the most was... well... Thing. It's by far the most humorous thing of the series. He might only be part man(?), or whatever he is, but somehow his appearances always seem to work out for the better.Also, according to the credits this is a Tim Burton's production but I didn't really notice much if anything of his influence. Perhaps he did the catering for the crew?",5
"Typical modern Hollywood Mess. This show tries so hard to be cool it wreaks of desperation. The show moves along in a clunky manner and the acting is stiff as a corpse. Try as they may to improve on the original Addams Family, they flunk out on every subject. The casting is hit and miss with Wednesday and Morticia being hits and the rest misses.I just don't understand why this awful mess is getting any positive reviews, but it seems that these days people rate everything as a 10. Reviewers seem to forget that there really has not been that many true 10's in film, so why would this rate a 10?? Curious why it rates as perfect? It is quite laughable. Anyway, this show is just plain boring and awful.",2
"There's barely anything connecting this to the Addams, just the name. Characters outside of Wednesday are boring. And on top of that it's just a bunch of teenage supernatural drama cliches and tropes we've seen already for over 10 years now.This feels like it was another show and Netflix decided to attach an IP to it to make it sell better. Pretty common nowadays but disappointed that this is from Burton. Most of his other fish out of water movies work so much better since there is more to the characters.I don't know, maybe I'm the wrong demographic for this or I'm looking at it the wrong way.",3
"Wednesday is presented as someone out of her time. She doesn't use the internet (she prefers writing on a typewriter), she doesn't watch television, and she doesn't care about social norms/cues.So then why does she use a term like ""mansplaining""? How did she even hear that word if she keeps to herself and doesn't socialize? Why does she care about the whitewashing of history? Why does she constantly talk about colonization? Why does she talk like a twitter user 50% of the time? This wouldn't be a problem if a character like Enid talked like this, but it makes no sense coming from someone who is supposedly detached from everyone and everything. For someone who we are meant to believe stands out, she sure talks like every other teenager her age.",5
"Overall I was satisfied with this series. It was not a home run, but it was definitely watchable. I thought Jenna Ortega played the part of Wednesday very well, and Catherine Zeta Jones made a good Morticia. The actor who played Uncle Fester reminded me of the original series depiction. I didn't have any major problems with any of the school mate characters or actors. The story and tone were on key, which I was happy with. It almost had a Harry Potter-esque vibe going on and a hint of Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow. The art direction was on point. The story stayed focused on Wednesday, which is a good thing. After all this wasn't an Addams Family show. The downside was the CG for the monster was a bit wonky and low quality. Also Gomez and Pugsley were a bit of a let down, but they aren't a major part of the show, so it did t subtract too much.",7
"The Addams Family movies were truly my favorites as a child. I've seen them both more times than I can count. That being said, this show is not the iconic 90s film, or the old show, or the classic cartoon. So just don't expect that and go into it with an open mind. I absolutely loved this show. Binged it in two days. It gives Tim Burton does Harry Potter with a twist of Nancy Drew. Wednesday is completely endearing, perfectly macabre. Her one liners hit every time. I love the relationships she forms with her peers and I enjoyed the mystery of the storyline. The cast is spectacular in my opinion. Perfectly creepy, kooky, mysterious, and spooky.",9
"I knew this would be fantastic before I even started watching it, as I am a huge fan of Tim Burton. And God, is he a master at what he does.This is utterly fantastic. It was dark, yet funny, yet heartwarming at times, which was honestly unexpected.Jenna Ortega's portrayal of Wednesday. Addams is phenomenal. I couldn't stop watching.Even better, I thought it was going to be incredibly predictable. And I won't talk about the ending, but I was incredibly surprised by the outcome.The only small criticism I have, I did not care of her uncle fester's part at all. And I would've liked to have seen a little more of Morticia. I loved Catherine Zeta Jones portrayal as Morticia.I really hope there's a second season. I can't wait for it. And I highly recommend the show!",10
"I was not sure about this as we have seen so many Addams Family movies over the years, but this is quite good. Jenna Ortega is great as Wednesday and she plays the part so well. The story is good and keeps you watching to see ""who dunnit""?Gwendoline Christie as the head mistress is great casting and she is perfect in that role!BUT Luis Guzman as Gomez is soooo wrong. He comes across as very very creepy and not in a good way! Catherine Zita Jones as Morticia does not work either.The rest of the younger cast play their parts well.An enjoyable series that keeps you guessing and just when you think you know the answer....they get bumped off!",8
"I wasn't sure if I would like this show and was not confident that the character Wednesday could be broad enough to have a stand-alone show, but I was pleasantly surprised.I binge-watched all the available episodes in no time, leaving me wanting another season.The only thing that disappointed me in the show was Gomez Addams, played by Luis Guzmán. While I like this actor, I don't feel he was a good fit for this character. Not sure how the casting director came to pick him; there had to be other actors who tried out. Fortunately, his character has a minimal role.Jenna Ortega completely steals the show with just enough darkness, dark humor, and goth romance to keep the show captivating.",10
"But it's a solid 7 the actress who plays Wednesday (Jenna Ortega) is very good as is Christina Ricci and Gwendoline Christie where it falls flat is the casting of Catherine zeta Jones as Morticia who isn't terrible but not that good either and Luiz Guzman as Gomez, whoever thought that these two would be a good fit should be shot because between them they have zero chemistry and it's painful to watch, when I used to watch the old black and white Adams family and the later remakes with Angelica Houston and Raul Julia there was real sexual chemistry between the them and that's was what made it's so good but this lack that chemistry and even though they're only in a couple of episodes they felt awkward to watch but having said all that it's still a solid show and worth watching if you liked Sabrina on Netflix you'll like this it's very similar in that it takes away some of the humour and replaces it with horror.",7
"The series was announced a few years ago. And all these years I, an ardent fan of Burton and Addams, have been waiting for a miracle. It will be just an orgasmic combo, such wonderful and perfectly combined 'ingredients' in one dish!However, from the very first minutes of the series, it became clear to me that everything was gone. Boredom... ringing boredom... No atmosphere, no worthwhile dialogues, no charismatic actors. Who riveted it? Did he even watch the original? The first episode, Mortisha's farewell to her daughter: Mortisha burst into tears from the fact that Wednesday talks to her unkindly. Seriously? Why turn a unique character of an infernal mother into an average American mom from movies?And Wednesday? Performed by Christina Ricci, she has become a legend! We still remember this amazing character. A psychopathic girl with a rod that you're really afraid of. What's going on here? Just a nerdy little girl in black clothes with a scowl.Judging by the general facelessness of the plot (and everything in general) and the similarity with hundreds of current youth series, it seems that Burton was rigidly placed within the framework of the modern agenda and he simply does not know how to fit into all this, so in trying to pass for his own, he makes a terribly clumsy 'G'.God, Timmy, how is this possible with your experience and spontaneity? You're a genius.That's it, I don't have the strength to paint this horror anymore, everything is bad there.",1
Ortega did a FANTASTIC job as Wednesday. She is lovely and dark! Who I can't stand watching are Guzman and Jones as Gomez and Morticia Addams. These characters are so iconic. These two actors failed where others have been successful. Their acting failed these two characters. Gomez always had a positive upbeat attitude who was always passionate and over the top. Guzman falls flat in his interpretation as Gomez. Jones is beautiful and classy but she lacks the spice required to be Morticia Addams. I'm so glad most of the series lacks both of them and concentrates mainly on Wednesday and her mystery solving.,8
"This show has got to be one of my all time favorites!On the first day of watching this i just got hooked and couldn't stop! In fact i binged the whole series in one day. The show isn't some spin off of the other Addams family movie, instead, it is a show about a new era of Wednesday. Wednesday is instead a high school student instead of a child. Wednesday is sent to a special boarding school where her parents met. Wednesday discovers that there are secrets within the school walls as well as the town it self so she decides to figure these secrets out for herself. There isn't much more i can say without giving it away but this is one of my favorite tv shows now that i have watched it and i recommend you watch it well!",10
"I cannot believe how good this is for a teenage tv show! Loved it!After waiting a while to see something different on Netflix, this comes along.Although I didn't think to much of it in the first 2 seconds, it started to surprise me.I loved the Angelica Huston/Raul Giulia Adams couple a lot, but the new ones exceeded my expectations. Actors great, plot great! Settings awesome, the movie was actually filmed in Romania and looks amazing.It has the goth, it has the drama, it has the mystery and of course it has the magic. Give it a chance when you can it is completely worth it.Go go Burton!",9
"You take the original funny, campy, dark comedy, intrigue on the original series, and meet that up with a darker modern version of said series. That's what you get with this. Gomez (whatever), Morticia (nicely done), Pugsley (whatever), Thing (perfect), Uncle Fester... I had my reservations because of the actoi, but he actually nailed it for this Addams Family type thing. And, Wednesday was supremely perfectly cast. Wednesday's not quite werewolf roomie was great. The entire cast was well done, and the story they portrayed was superb. If you like weird, funny, scary, odd stuff... watch it. It's worth it.",9
"I didn't have high hopes - stand-alone movies were nice as they've been set on unknown territory and in result we could be getting pretty much anything and I loved that. It was a kingdom of catchie phrases (""Debbie, pastels?!""), funny cross overs and a bit of kids gore. Drop all your hope if your looking for this in burtons series.As Morticia I could forgive a lot but lack of quick and smart humor is just way too big pill to swollow. Sabrina, oh sorry Wednesday suddenly have feelings and learnes to have friends. Sorry - not my Addams story. Disappointing and quite flat and boring. The Netflix family filter is definitely not helping here. Such a waste of potential or maybe it's one of those should never been touched?",4
"I thought this was gonna be a kids series like others on Netflix, with not much story line and mainly focus on school dramas etc... But I was hooked on the first episode. I'm a big Harry Potter fan, and ever since the series is finished, I am on the hunt for something similar. This show is it!It is a well rounded show. Story is written well. All mysteries are explained in the end. Characters are well written, except Tyler and Xavior. The show could have given them a more complex story, but no, all I know about them is that they have a fascination for Wednesday. The whole show they only follow Wednesday and try to get her to date them. Wednesday just keeps making mistake that gets her and her friends killed/injured, and she doesn't learn from it. But of course she is bullet proof as a MC, so the show runners think it's ok for her to do all these things without thinking. It just shows that she is not a very smart person.Some parts of the story are long. The final boss fight was disappointing and lack of climax.However, it is a great show overall. Lots of mysterious and magic elements. If the show runner writes well for the next seasons, this show could really be the next Harry Potter.",8
"I really enjoyed this and it's so much more reflective of the original cartoon/comic by Charles Addams.Gomez was originally depicted as having a somewhat grotesque appearance, with a tubby body, a snub-nose, a crooked tooth and a receding chin. Luiz Guzman portrays this so well.Catherine Zeta Jones is so beautiful and elegant, I think she plays Morticia well, although Angelica Houston is a hard one to beat!Jenna Ortega is brilliant as Wednesday and was pleased to see Christina Ricci in the show too as one of the teachers.Loved all the other characters in the school.Really hope this is renewed for further seasons.",8
"The best TV show in a very long time. The acting Was outstanding. Not only for the main actress playing Wednesday, but by everyone. The support cast were so strong. Catherine Zeta Jones was well cast and was great. I loved Thing, Heidi, the sirene. Shouted for joy when Heidi Wolfed out. Good story and well paced.8 episodes Was perfect. The cinematography was excellent.All the young cast have a big future in Hollywood.Give this a go. Hubby was also hooked. He originally thought it was just a high school bit of nonsense and was pleasantly surprised.It keeps you guessing pretty close to the end, and the dark humour just made it fun to watch.",10
"Who would think that Addams family mixed with Tim Burton would end in a teenager serie trying to mimic Harry Potter. I expected more from Tim Burton and don't find the spirit of the movie but just another Netflix marketed serie for kids.The main character is now 20 instead of 11 in the movie still wearing braids and the story begins in a college nowadays...
The plot also is not really follow able. I can't follow an episode completely without feeling bored.But maybe I am not the target for this kind of serie. Only watch if you like teenagers movies.Only Christina Ricci and Catherine Zeta Jones are gorgeous in their roles but you don't see them often.",2
"It's not an exaggeration to say this is literally ""Riverdale"" and ""Chilling Adventures of Sabrina"" story lines that got rearranged & copy and pasted for this show's plot, I know that because I did myself the misfortune of sitting through all these shows. It's a disappointment, with misleading trailers and reviews. It's so grossly over-hyped just for you to realize it's nothing but a lazy cash-grab, and that's why every promotion focused so much attention to the big names rather than the story or content itself. Something that you can unmask about the positive reviews is that none of them are critical or capable of a detailed opinionated review. Their reviews are vague and reason-less because they liked the decent looking actors, the superficial aesthetic, the good but basic indie/overplayed soundtrack, and the slightly Tim Burton atmosphere, but they're unable to pinpoint that because most of these reviewers are likely unaware of it. When it comes to the actual story, no way did anyone like this shallow plot that is no joke, a rip-off of ""Riverdale"" and ""Chilling Adventures of Sabrina"". The protagonist is a cookie cutter ""weird girl"" who always has to remind you every time she opens her mouth that she's ""not like other girls"" which gets old quick but lasts the whole series. No character, not even the protagonist, has growth, depth, character, or culture (which is ironic because of how much Jenna talks in interviews about representing her Latin culture). The dialogue the writers wrote for the protagonist is very clearly what a mindless person would imagine a thinking person sounds like but to anyone sensible she just sounds very pretentious and childishly edgy. While previous depictions of Wednesday made her a smart and funny character (and movies like Addams Family Values gave her growth), this Wednesday is hard to not cringe at. You can tell this was just a paycheck to the creators because they literally thought throughout this series that a one-off act done in the movies was some kind of deeper connection to her history. They took an interesting eccentric family and instead chose to center the story on boring cardboard cutouts of fantasy teen drama extras who are an unsubtle attempt to one-up the eccentrics of the family which obviously misses the entire point of the Addams Family. On the second watch, It really stuck out, how bad the acting is, most of the actors are either under-performing their parts or dramatically performing like Disney channel cartoon characters. In its most basic proposition this show had potential if there were any creative minds involved. The biggest disappointment is the reception, lousy cliche cash grabs like this getting positive support to this extent, just confirms people will eat up anything. If they like the aesthetic, the big names, and the heavily reused soundtrack, regardless of any effort or creativity on their end people will pay a lot more for copy and pasted formulaic media. We're in a never-ending cycle of unoriginal and uninspired remakes, reboots, redesigns, spin-offs, sequels, etc. Because big companies like getting rid of any shred of originality and people support milking out any creativity to the point media becomes this dry. It's frustrating because even the people involved in making this series have publicly admitted to rushing it and inserting the most basic and predictable cliches because of how little this side-project mattered to them.",1
"Glad to see I'm not the only one that's seeing this.Normies? Muggles? Um, what?The headscarf with snake underneath?That rowing competition?The statue that leads into a tomb?The shapeshifters, the werewolves... I mean, if there is a season 2, will they reveal Cousin Itt to be an Afghan Hound?Also,
+ Twilight
+Chilling Adventures of Sabrina
+ that classic Simpsons episode where Lisa uncovers the truth about Jebediah SpringfieldCatherine Zeta Jones was a mid casting choice as Morticia. Also, it bothered me how they made Morticia some kind of preppy soccer helicopter mom that's trying to manipulate Wednesday.Jenna Ortega tried her best in the title role. But I found myself cringing a bit too much - but that was mostly the writing so can't really blame her for that, except that dance at the prom - 60's Wednesday knows how to break it down (iykyk).Tbh, I'm shocked that this show is being accepted so well.Shows/stories like this remind me of going to church where pastors preach the same stories/rules to a congregation that just laps it up.I found myself saying ""Wednesday wouldn't react like this"" so many times.",5
"Absolutely horrible. Usually when something is this bad production is stopped mis project. Giving Wednesday super powers? How rediculous is that?! I see why there are many bad reviews and why Netflix is doing damage control and have them removed. Tim Burton's directing couldn't even save this monstrosity. None the the characters look like, act, match anything like they should. It is more as though this is a parody meant to mock The Adam's Family. I tried to find anything about it as to go so far to analize the camera work, lighting, dialog, anything. It was just very poorly done from the beginning. The cast is is full of greats but cannot perform the characters well, the writing is the worst, it is as though a bunch of Jr. Highers got a quarter million dollars for their project and had no guidance.",10
"I've been so excited to see this series & it didn't disapoint me at all!Jenna Ortega was born to play Wednesday Addams & I really enjoyed watching her play this iconic character, that is loved by so many.This series is so funny, entertaining, well casted & totally awesome from the very beginning until the end. It's a nice addition to the Addam Family's legacy ??It was truly a delight to watch the amazing Gwendoline Christie play Larissa Weems. Her scenes with Wednesday were my absolute favorite. I love them & they both got my whole heart after their magical performances.When I heard that Christina Ricci had been added to the cast, I was so happy & her performance as Marilyn Thornhill were pure brilliance.Other favorites of mine from this series are Enid, Thing, Eugene, Bianca, Xavier, Tyler, Yoko & Ajax. I really hope we'll get a season 2, so we can see more of these wonderful characters.This might not be to everyone's liking but I really enjoyed watching it & totally recommend you to give it a try!",10
"I have been watching this with my twelve year old daughter and it is absolutely awesome ??.Like most we were unsure if anyone else could match up to Christina Ricci but Jenna does an absolutely brilliant job of it and easily matches up to Ricci bringing her own slant to the role.The show has everything;
Awesome cast and acting
Stunning visuals
Humour
Horror
Special effectsBrilliant,easy to follow storylineWe are on episode four. Looking forward to the other four episodes!!It's worth it just for Wednesdays outfit and then dance at the ball.....
I guarantee you will smile from ear to ear ??Enjoy!!",10
"What a great show, dark, funny and great story line. Lots of subtle nods and references to old school Adams family stories including actors/actresses from that era.Great casting of Wednesday she played the emotionless yet dark character perfectly!Hats off to the costume team as well for all characters new and familiar.It would be nice to learn more about the school and the different types of teachers but try not to go too hogwarts though with Tim Burton at the helm I'm sure it won'tWell done netflix another binge worthy series I'd happily watch again....so when is season 2 coming? I'd love to see more of how the school was created and who by.",10
"I´m still amazed at Tim Burton´s last work (of art). Where to begin? The gorgeous gothic aesthetic? The excellent soundtrack? The magnificent performances? For me it´s reading in between (and not so in between) the lines. Who are the outcasts? The lgbtq plus community, the migrants, the weirdos, the freaks, every one that´s not a ""normie""? A normie according to whose standards? Wednesday is a cry against discrimination and exclusion and I´m effing loving it fuerte! Recomiendo este show to everybody, teens, grown ups and children as well aunque hay algunas escenas que son scary no es nada que les niñes no hayan visto antes. Desperately wanting more!",10
"I have been looking forward to this series for months! I'd been counting down the days and really hoping that the series would live up to my expectations and not ruin Wednesday as a character. It surpassed my expectations and they didn't ruin her at all!This dark, spooky action packed mystery and still comedic at times, was absolutely perfect.I've always loved Jenna as an actress from my childhood programs and she was the perfect Wednesday- she looked the part and I loved the hair and outfits and the so very Wednesday facial expressions, and she acted to perfection. All of the characters were well developed and the plot had lots of unexpected twists and turns in it. I binged the show in a week.Although it's a twelve, it contained quite a bit of gore (I was absolutely fine with it ) but I advise you just to check that you'll be ok with it before watching, but other than that it's so good! Would 100% recommend and hoping for season two ??????",10
"I watched the Adam's family as kid but never really thought much of it and wasn't a favorite of mine or anything.My girlfriend recommended the show saying people thought it was good and I'm open to try new shows so I agreed we should check it out.The acting is really good, the script is great, it's funny, dark, her character is not representative of anyone I know and it was really interesting to see the world through a different lens. My girlfriend said Tim Burton told Wednesday not to blink in the show, that was something I noticed. Really crazy.I'm a big fan of the fantasy genre and there was an element of this to the show which was great. To me it was a mix of a fantasy show, mystery and comedy. Highly recommend the show and we are really hoping for many more seasons if the quality stays this good!",10
"This was a surprise I was not expecting. This show is here to entertain us and oh boy it did.Jenna Ortega did amazing job and so did all other actors. With these kind of roles it can get a bit sketchy over time, but not here. The story is interesting and the dialogues were written really good. There are some lazy writing fillers, but honestly they fit perfectly for the purpose to focus on bigger picture and not hang on endless details.Also fans of other movies that are made around magic and beasts will enjoy the Easter eggs this series have. Its almost like quiz to make you more invested into the show.I'm so glad I watched this!",9
Holy crap this is the best show of 2022 it's worth the 2 year wait and I hope this isn't a mini series I hope this has 5 or 3 seasons it's absolutely brilliant way better than 1899 and walking dead it's very dark brutal and incredibly funny Jenna Ortega is amazing as Wednesday the first 7 episodes are brilliant the plot twist was unexpected the cliffhanger is so annoying cause u have to wait 3 years for season 2 the final episode I would give a 8.2 cause it's kinda confusing and strange like was Xavier the real Hyde that's what so weird u never find out who took the pictures of Wednesday I hope everyone enjoys this TV show I absolutely love it.,10
"I adore the movies from the 90s, so I was absolutely wishing and hoping this show will bring back the charm, comedy and eccentricities of the Addams', considering Burton is directing this one. Boy was I wrong. This hits all the wrong spots to the point where it's just not the Addams family.The whole premise revolved around the clash of this unique family with normal vanilla society. So we get mermaids and werewolves? What? This literally makes Wednesday lose what was special about her, because she's actually the most ordinary one in the bunch. She's just a goth girl with mediocre teenage angst and the rest is every high-school show you've ever seen.Remember her going to camp? That was classic. This is what I was expecting. What I got was just a teenager going to school Scooby-Doo mystery with none of the ingredients that made this family magical.I'm not even going to get into the casting of the parents, each a disgrace to their former counterpart's brilliant and charismatic performance. They could have just put a black dress on a tree and call it a day. Below zero chemistry.Then you have this horrible relationship between Wednesday and literally everyone. They used to have such amazing family dynamics. It was the perfect contrast to their absolute horridness that we all loved.Where's the dark comedy? Where's the craziness of this twisted family while presenting it completely normal? I gave it 3 stars purely because of production value, but content is zero for me. Bored out of my mind.#justiceforwednesday.",3
I started watching this and can't stop watching it now. Was not expecting this. I was surprised to see Catherine Zeta Jones playing Morticia. All the Adams Family are back. Really enjoy watching Thing. Also surprised this was a Tim Burton's work. So neat to see Christina Ricci in it as she is a past Wednesday. It kind of reminded me of a dark Harry Potter. Hoping there will be a second season on Wednesday.Gwendoline Christie it is nice to see this actress out of her Game of Thrones character.The only disappointment is Gomez. He does not have the charm or good looks as the movie Gomez. Could have been better cast.,10
Like most others i'm sure they weren't expecting too much from a netflix adaptation. But i was pleasantly surprised it was in in my opinion an easy watch. In my case it kept me coming back for more. I think Jenna did an amazing job of portraying Wednesday. My only qualm is they could've made her more like the original. In the way she was always trying to kill her brother she had no problem doing something bad. She wasn't just dark she was also a little evil. They could've done that with the whole family to be honest. They all seemed a little soft. But i still give a 10/10 because i still thoroughly enjoyed there adaptation. And i'm hoping for a second season where they can redeem themselves in that area.,10
"This is the most delightfully rendered fun thing I've seen on TV in years. No heavy philosophy or critical issues just sheer enjoyment and charm.Jenna Ortega is key and I can't imagine her losing to anyone when the award shows come around.The director's awards are far more tricky, but if it were up to me, I'd crown Tim Burton best of the lot. We're about 4 episodes in and in each one there have been signs of true genius in his choices and they're almost incomparably exquisite. As an example, his take on Thing goes way beyond the call of duty.When I think of the cartoon series and how Burton saw something he could work with and how easily I brushed it off as not my thing back in the day, I feel bad for myself.What a gift!",9
"I don't know where to start, I can only say that this series was able to show the paradox of the character in the best way and establish an admirable relationship between the audience and himself despite the mysterious character of Wednesday.Considering the cold atmosphere of the story, we can safely say that this series has been able to maintain its comedy mood well.In fact, it should be pointed out that there is room to work on special effects, and on the other hand, it should not be forgotten that characterization and storytelling really do not matter.Finally, I suggest you not to miss this series because I guarantee you will definitely not regret watching it.",10
"This is not the reimagining of the Wednesday Addams. Now she is like a broken heart girl who wears punk fashion without any Addams DNA. The Addams are close to each other in the family because they have their lifestyles, which are different from the others but don't make them lonely. They have friends and fun activities and are not afraid of sad emotions. Tim destroyed the Addams by giving them the loser character to all the family and making them normal.So please find the 1993 version or some cartoon and feel free to watch it then; you will see what I mean and you will understand how funny this family.",1
"After acting like a grown adult, and giving the show a run through, i'm hooked. Jenna Ortega quickly takes on the role of this reimagining.Her delivery of the beloved character is definitely her own, but just as entertaining. She's quirky, strange, and dark humored just as anyone would expect. There are some cheese moments but then again so did the original Addams family material.In a way, it's refreshing that the show runners didn't take this the full brooding, dark, and insincere serious tone that a lot our other childhood favorite comics or original films have opted for as of recent.Definitely give yourself an episode or two acclimate. It'll feel just right in not time at all.",10
"When i heard that there was a series dedicated solely to my faviourte character from the addams family coming out, i was exited. I thought that maybe the series will be dark and a bit spooky but not much story line. Well i was wrong Tim Burton suprised me with an absolute mastetpiece. Its suspensfull spooky and funny much more than i ever imagined. The whole cast is simply amazing and everyone fits perfectly in their role, even though i was used to the old addams family and at first thought that morticia and gomez where not casted propably, but again i was wrong, latet in the series you can only be amazed by both their acting. The background and music always fit perfectly, small little details(roses in both hospital room and bedroom from the therapist) were stuning. Until the last eposode you never truly knew who the mastermind was. Waiting patiently for season 2.",10
"Tim Burton's new TV series was great. The two year wait, was worth it. I hope they will renew it for a second season. Jenna Ortega was brilliant as the titular character, she really brought Wednesday life. The design of Thing was completely the best thing I ever saw. The other actors were strong and well played, the only thing I would change. Would be Catherine Zeta Jones as Mortisha, I felt her acting was flat and never screamed Mortisha. I would still recommend this too my family and friends too watch.Enid finally Wolfing Out in the episode 8 was great.Thing almost dieing in episode 7 was heartbreaking.",10
"Burton and Elfman have collaborated on so many over the top masterpieces that a person might believe the subject matter and actors don't even matter. They could take the lamest wokest most cliche'd set of tropes, or, for instance, one of the insufferably adolescent Stephen King stories, and turn it into something magic and memorable. That being said, the lead actress is stellar, capturing a morbid cloud and still emitting rays of humor and beauty. It is also a surprise and delight that the giant warrior lady from game of thrones is quite a salty actress in more tame surroundings. The only other point IS the selection of material. The Addams family, which kind of invented dark slapstick, is really a daunting subject for a remake/sequel. Never fear. Or, should I say, always fear.",9
"I love anymovie that tim burton makes that so i love this one when i found out that tim burton is the director of the series, i guessed that it must be a good series and he has created another wonderful world. I'm waiting for next season , soooooon please. My favorite character in this series is thing. It's so funny and cute. Also character of enid. I think their relationship was so beatiful. She made wednesday able to express her feelings. The last scene of the movie, when wednesday hugs enid, was very emotional. And i wished i had a friend like that. In general, this series is great for those who love the fantasy genre.",10
"All the right pieces were there to make something great, something unique, instead they chose an easy way out, creating a dull, uninspired mystery show combined with cheesy teenage drama you'd normally find on CW. Jenna Ortega, Gwendoline Christie and Luis Guzman (and all other comics-inspired characters) put on a captivating performance. There's still a bit of heart present in the show, but in the end it chooses to omit its most interesting ideas and it pains me to say that in the end, it was not worth it. Should've been a mystery-of-the-week kind of thing or just a 6-episodes mini-series with more of the Addams family's fun adventures!",6
"This series has it all... comedy, drama, romance, mystery and action all wrapped in a delightfully quirky package. It's rare that I binge watch anything but I was riveted by this show. It's clever. The writing is smart, the costumes and scenics are dazzling and the cinematography took great advantage of the location work in Romania. This level of acting, production design and visual effects are rare in a television series and more what one expects on the big screen. I would've liked a slightly longer season than 8 episodes, I feel 10 would have been better. Still, this show is a winner. Watch it.",10
"That any other thing said would be pure pompous redundancy.From now on in this review I will just write any random jibberish, since the minimum required number is characters for the review is 600.Less is more. If you need to prolong your opinion for so long, it sounds like you are not certain about your logic.Precision is the key. Concise arguments are sharp, short. Hit you instantly.But rules only exist to be broken. If this imdb policy shall not be quickly reviewed, the tool will became increasingly irrelevant. Amazon's fingers are too deep rooted steering its directions away from neutrality.",10
"Tim Burton is back with a very fun, dark and dynamic show - a reminder of his talent.Finally, he chose a representative and diverse cast, with outstanding performances by all the actors involved. They all do a fantastic job with their roles, with Jenna Ortega stealing the show. It's like the role was written for her, she is humorous, dark and beautiful (the 'dance scene' in episode 4 is just magic). The chemistry between the actors was also spot on. I enjoyed that throughout the story the characters bring up themes around loneliness, death, love, emotions, family - existential aspects we all hold close to us.Great direction and cinematography, nothing less than expected from Tim Burton. The music accompanying the show is syncing amazingly with the scenes. He takes you to another of his magical worlds with the Addams family in the centre of it.",9
"Going by the fact Netflix was producing this and the promos were making this show out to be ""CW-esque"", my expectations were pretty low. The only reason I gave it shot was because it's more or less a spinoff of The Addams Family.And after slogging through a lot of poorly paced and terribly written western TV shows this year like Rings of Power, various MCU shows, and whatever Alex Kurtzman passes off as Star Trek these days, ""Wednesday"" is like an Oasis in a desert.The show is basically Veronica Mars with Wednesday Addams, or a Goth version of Nancy Drew for those who never watched the former. What that means for the layman is that it's a murder mystery show with Wednesday Addams being our titular detective at the center of it all. And oddly enough, the premise actually works.The first episode does a good job of setting up the premise and introducing all the characters, quickly establishing everyone's relationship dynamics and their place in the show. And most importantly the main plot thread of this season-a mysterious creature that randomly kills people around town, and several seemingly unrelated side mysteries.So, every episode is usually juggling multiple plot threads at once, whether that be character building moments or making progress on one of the several different mysteries running simultaneously. Every scene serves a purpose, which more than I can say about Andor or Rings of Power, which both squander or pad out their runtime with pointless filler or stretching out an already thin plot.Now the all important question, is it woke? Yes & No. It does have a diverse cast of characters, yet it doesn't feel like they're going off a checklist. Most of the men in the show aren't doormats for the female characters, save for a couple of them-and even then they do stand up for themselves when they're pushed to far.None of the female characters are infallible, including Wednesday herself. While she does excel at many things; she's not invincible, nor is she perfect, and surprisingly she is wrong from time to time. And she does have to rely on other people-a good bit of them being men. The biggest surprise is that she actually loves & respects her father Gomez-she's actually grateful for all the things he's taught her over the years.She makes a few obvious snipes about ""the patriarchy"" and people ""mansplaining"" to her, but they are few and far between and even then the people she's saying this to either don't know what she's talking about or they're rolling their eyes at her, and never dwell on it-kinda the same way shows like ""Daria"" use to do it back in the day, but in this instance it's to a lesser degree. And unlike most female protagonists these days, Wednesday actually tries to learn from her mistakes, and experiences some personal growth.And there's like one lesbian couple in the show, who are parents of one of the side characters, but they're not obnoxious about their inclusion, they're just there.Does it bash White people for no apparent reason? Actually, it never comes up. At least not overtly. They do make references to the colonial days where they use to burn witches (or in this case outcasts) at the stake, so to speak. But the race of said people were never brought up.Are Minorities (POCs) treated like the paragons of virtue that can do no wrong? Nope, they're treated like regular people/characters with no special treatment, and fill a wide variety of roles in the story like any other character would.So, yes it's diverse, but diverse in a more organic way. And all the characters have a story arc, even some the antagonists experience some growth. Nobody stays static in this show.After binge watching this show in one sitting, I'm really looking forward to what they're going to do next season.",9
"Wednesday is a gothic introverted show that is spooky and quite simply awesome and I have watched it twice now, it's worth the watch.I absolutely love the story, the actors are fantastic and the Edgar Allan Poe references are just superb. The detective work that Wednesday does is easy to follow along too and of course her intelligent remarks about the school and the town are enjoyable.Jenna Ortega as Wednesday makes the show, she literally took a fictional character and made her absolutely outstanding. Straight away you are hooked, her mannerisms and the way she speaks in multiple languages make her a very intriguing character.The fashion alone in the show is calming and completely matches everyone and everything within the story. I found every character interesting and the acting very convincing, this honestly helps the story because you really want to find out ""Who done it?!""I adore Tim Burtons work, he is one of my favourite directors. Danny Elfmans music makes every scene either suspenseful or spooky. It's a really great way to add to the scene, so you don't have to rely on the visuals alone, audio is a great clue.The storyline makes complete sense and it really does make you go ""omg no way!""
I really do recommend watching this show, it's perfect for any introvert who loves spooky and fantastical shows or movies. Better yet this show is great for all the quirky people out there that are simply different.",10
"When i first saw this poster for the show i was super excited since i used to love Adams Family! And guess what... This did not disappoint!First of all, the actors were fantastic but especially Jenna Ortega. The cast worked great together and i could feel the chemistry though my screen.This show was not what i was expecting out of an Adams Family reboot but i think Tim Burton did an amazing job with giving Wednesday a new storyline and background. This show came with a lot of fun but insane twists that will leave your jaw on the floor every episode. And to be completely honest i wasn't expecting that last one which just shows how unpredictable this show can be! Definitly one of my favorites this year.",9
"Not the worst thing I've watched but was disappointed in the show. Plot is pretty predictable, and I agree with others how the Addams family are weird and unique but then to throw them in a whole world with vampires, werewolves and sirens(and even more), they are no longer that weird and unique. Especially Wednesday, the actress that played her did wonderful but the actual character was just a teenager who was clearly miserable like most of the other teenagers out in the world. I think the only thing that saved this show enough for it to be rated 5 stars was its humour which again was delivered by Wednesday and also Thing.The character Enid is terrible and extremely annoying. Very unrelatable and wouldn't be any 16 year old in reality.... She was just so over the top. I understand them wanting to create a character that is opposite to Wednesday, but they either need to hire a better actress or tone down the character because it just didn't deliver. It also made her seem extremely childish compared to the rest of the cast, even Bianca who acted childish for most of the series. That's just how bad Enid was.Now let's talk about the hyde and Enid's wolf. For Enid's over the top, annoying and too colourful character, she gets to turn into THE ugliest wolf. The sirens in the show look beautiful and creates more of a magical atmosphere, but I was disappointed to see that Enid's wolf looked so much like the hyde monster. Was just not fitting. The hyde is supposed to be creepy and that but again why would you make Enid's wolf look so awful given that her character is so colourful? Especially after she spends the whole season worrying if she's going to change into a wolf or not. Expected her to change into the most elegant and beautiful wolf and attack this monster and come out stronger from the experience. It just made me not want to vouch for her even more.Lastly, I think this isn't a terrible watch but honestly I can't say I'm on the edge of my seat anticipating every moment working up to season 2(which their most likely will be). I also feel these higher reviews are from people that either don't care about the flaws of this series or have fallen head over heels for Wednesday(and the actress that plays her). Because really she saved the series but still wouldn't be able to rate higher given the amount of flaws in this series.",5
"Been loving this series. I like the spin on this series, but no surprise here. Me and my family Love horror, dark themed things, and anything Tim Burton!! If you like Addams family, Sabrina the Teenage Witch, or the new darker Riverdale, you will probably enjoy. It's like mixing Addams family with Monster High and the new Sabrina the Teenage Witch. The casting has been perfect. It also gives Wednesday more depth and seems as though it'll add more depth to the rest of the Addams. A nice dark detective-like series with goth and monster influence. The more gorey details with blood and big deep cuts or slashes are a fun addition.",10
"I won't go into long detail about the story line other than that it follows Wednesday as she gets sent off to boarding school and separates from the Addams Family but I will say that the acting is great, the story is fun, the directing is on point and Thing should have always had stitches (it just looks better). They did this show right! They didn't put a bunch of BS in it like more and more shows are doing now days, they just stuck to what it is put in great effort and I think it's going to pay off. Really hoping for and looking forward to more seasons on Wednesday. Kudos to Netflix, Tim Burton, the actors and everyone involved- a job well done.",8
"I loved all the movies of Family Addams and was very happy, but skeptic when I heard that they would do a serie on Wednesday. I was hooked from the first minutes. The character of Wednesday Addams is beautifully interpreted by Jenna Ortega. Thing is always so funny and I love uncle Fester. However, Morticia and Gomez lacked the chemistry and charm that the actors gave them in the movies. Hopefully, they were not often on screen so they do not influence my rating of the tv show. I loved the contrast between Wednesday and Enid. Enid is such a good character and I loved that each characters were so well rounded. So much action and emotions... I binged watched the tv show in less than 2 days. What a show! I really hope they will do a season 2! Watch it you will love it! If you loved the movies you might have some places where you find that this show is not accurate. However, the story is captivating.",9
"Ok, so we have Wednesday Addams - from the Addams family who is meeting vampires and werewolves etc in a teenage drama/detective mystery in a Hogwarts/Veronica Mars/Riverdale setting. Wednesday begins to have visions, becomes an amateur detective in a murder mystery, gets drawn into a love triangle, and learns to socialize. So teenage drama.This is not necessary a bad idea though - the original series basically had one pitch only. The Addams family is an family where every-thing is the opposite of what is expected. They hate cute, nice things like dogs and happyness and love vile, strange things like torture, swamps, depression and dangerous beasts. The creepy and the kooky but also the dangerous (even if the 60s show in general was a bit tame) and every episode had normal society interact with them in some way. This was followed by the later 90s movies - movies with great actors but with a script that was a bit so-so and too much focus on Fester. In short - Addams need to branch out a bit.In this spin-off, Wednesday is getting the focus due to the characters popularity from Christinas Riccis acting in said 90s movies. She has clearly grown to high school age (she was very young in the 60s show and very underused) and is enrolling in a Hogwarts like place for freaks and outcasts. Again not a bad idea. However, while I get that they want to focus more on the sarcastic and antisocial parts of the Addams brand, the character was also sadistic and death-obsessed. The initial Piranha scene works well, but then she becomes way too sympathetic. Not necessary a huge problem, but her Addams Root is weakened - you could have simply invent a new girl, remove the Addams name entirely and go for that. In addition, the script in general is pretty weak. Its a bit too generic, too YA for it to really work. They should allow more gore, maybe letting Wednesday murder, torture or maim a classmate or something. I get that you could call it growth - but I am not sure I want to see her character evolve that much. In some episodes she is joined by other members of the family, but their scenes are mostly forgettable. The show is not about the family.However, this is saved by in general good acting and a pretty decent Tim Burton aesthetic. I would call it amazing, buts decent and cute and that can be enough. Just don´t do in expecting something really creative and unique here and if you are a hardcore Addams fan, you might want to skip this completely, since the focus isn´t really on the family and their kookyness. But it is very charming and that can be enough.",7
"I walked into watching this thinking it was going to be great, bring back some much loved childhood memories and amaze me. Jenna Ortega managed to make Wednesday into a far more interesting character and her recital on the rooftop was brilliant not to mention the Nothing Else Matters overture at times.Even if you have never watched the original material, anyone can pick this show up and have a woefully great time. Thing for example manages to amuse, entertain and leave questions ""Where the hell is the rest of him?"" not to mention ""How do they get Thing to be alive?""Well worth watching and I look forward to more.",10
"It's like the Addams family , Harry Potter and a series of unfortunate events had a child. This is better than I expected! To me Christina Ricci will ALWAYS be Wednesday but wow, Jenna Ortega really brings it! It's witty and fun and is a fun watch. Im super excited to see where this show goes!!!Jenna Ortega as Wednesday Adam's is truly fun. She nails the cold dark vibe to Wednesday , the no smile , the dark eyes and the iconic pigtails. The way she delivers her lines is a great start to this show. Her wardrobe is fun ( even if it's just a uniform). And we can't forget about thing! Truly a good time.",8
"Jenna Ortega IS Wednesday Addams. The young actress is the center of the TV series and definitely she is perfect for the role. If you are looking for a worthy option to watch after Harry Potter film franchise, this is it. It's a delicious dark dramedy where you have smart writing giving great black humor along with a compelling mystery, all wrapped in a respectful lore of The Addams Family. Maybe Gomez and Morticia could be better performed but after all, this is not about them, this is about Wednesday, this is her show and as I already told you, Jenna Ortega just nailed an improved version of the character even way better than the film version by Christina Ricci but never forget her since that actress appears in the new TV series too. Also Gwendoline Christie shows her wonderful acting skills as the mysterious principal of Nevermore Academy. Moreover almost all the characters are well done and giving value to the story. Totally recommended and without a doubt, this masterpiece from the mind of Tim Burton is one of the best new TV series of 2022.",10
"Wow where to begin!Jenna Ortega totally owns the role as Wednesday Addams. She portrays the incredibly intelligent and witty script perfectly..she totally nails it. Her eyes are ridiculously mesmerising, the feelings she manages to relay through them is simply unbelievable.Tim Burton is a genius and i thank him immensely for bringing Wednesday to all of us.Luis Guzmán as Gomez & Catherine Zeta-Jones as Morticia were perfectly cast as Wednesday's parents.Gwendoline Christie as Nevermore's principle was fantastic.Mr. Victor Dorobantu...although we never saw you..we all saw your hand as you played Thing! Being Wednesdays side kick and protector we thought you were amazing..how a scarred hand can be cute is hard to describe but it's true.I was greatly impressed after watching an amazing 8 episodes..thank you to everyone involved and looking forward to season 2! Bravo!",10
"I only watched the first episode of Wednesday and feel uncertain about continuing with the series. The music and special effects are amazing! As well as the actress who plays Wednesday. The huge downfall is that in the series, Wednesday and the Addams Family are seen as ""mean spirited."" That is not how the original series was at all. In the original series, The Addams Family, the family loved being weird, and could not understand why a normal society, (seen as strange to the family) could not accept them. They still loved each other, and were kind and considerate to each other. The pairings of John Astin and Carolyn Jones as Gomez and Mortica, along with Ken Weatherwax as Pugsley. And Lisa Loring as Wednesday showed a family that loved and cared about each other. Who all liked to do strange things. But they almost never had evil intent to hurt others. In contrast, they would feel puzzled about why a visitor's behavior in their home would feel strange to them. To the Addams Family, they saw their world as perfectly normal, but very rarely would they act or react with threats of violence, unless a visitor was really a threat to them. However, the Netflix series, Wednesday tries to compensate the flawed premise of Wednesday Addams being evil, by using great music and special effects. The result is brilliant CGI animation and music. But this can't save the flawed characterization of Wednesday as mean-spirited, when the real Wednesday Addams was not. Fans of the classic 1960's show may want to stick with the original series for these reasons.",5
"First Impressions:Wednesday Addams... The name needs no introduction, at least not to fans of the ""Addams Family"" franchise. This series captured Wednesday's experiences as a student in a frightfully fantastic gothic light that made it everything, and more, that fans like myself have been expecting to see. If you consider this show a live-action version of the 1992 cartoon series, many of the creative elements you'll discover as you go will make exponentially more sense.The Crew:Tim Burton, Gandja Monteiro, James Marshall did exemplary work directing this series. They captured some nice yesteryear ""Addams"" vibes while including some newfangled twists.Alfred Gough, Miles Millar, Kayla Alpert, April Blair, Matt Lambert's writing was aces and deserves high praise. It might not have been easy to script a series of episodes around a multi-generational fan-favourite character, but they succeeded in that endeavour.Chris Bacon and Danny Elfman's musical scoring was brilliant. It was a balance of familiar and fresh that will be an auditory treat for fans of this franchise. The soundtracks were great as well, especially the covers and instrumentals.David Lanzenberg and Stephan Pehrsson's cinematography contained a world of captivation and wonder. It was immersive in all the right ways.Mark Scruton's production design was great.Set decoration and art direction were superb.Editing, sound effects, and VFX were amazing.Hair-makeup and Colleen Atwood's costume design were outstanding.The stunts team did remarkable work.The Cast:Jenna Ortega as Wednesday Addams was perfection. She also double-acted as Goody Addams, her distant ancestor.Christina Ricci as Marilyn Thornhill was nostalgic and brilliant.Gwendoline Christie as Principal Larissa Weems was unforgettable.Isaac Ordonez as Pugsley Addams was good.Catherine Zeta-Jones as Morticia Addams was interesting.Luis Guzmán as Gomez Addams was funny and good.Fred Armisen as Uncle Fester was noteworthy.George Burcea as Lurch was good.Victor Dorobantu as Thing (the hand) was an amazing addition to the show. His 'character design' was great.Hunter Doohan as Tyler Galpin was outstanding.Emma Myers as Enid Sinclair was captivating.Georgie Farmer as Ajax Petropolus was memorable.Percy Hynes White as Xavier Thorpe was notable.Calum Ross as Rowan Laslow was quite good.Joy Sunday as Bianca Barclay was enchanting.Riki Lindhome as Dr Valerie Kinbott was good.Jamie McShane as Sheriff Donovan Galpin was great.Moosa Mostafa as Eugene Otinger was engaging.Sophia Nomvete as Connie Jorgensen was a pleasant surprise.William Houston as Joseph Crackstone was good.Gracy Goldman as Gabrielle (Bianca's siren mother) was captivating.Amanda Drew as Esther Sinclair (Enid's werewolf mother) was quite good.Plot Summary & Analysis:Wednesday Addams went to school *snap snap*. Classic ""Addams"" vibes and relevant corny-cool elements enriched the series to no end. I loved how they gave enough freedom to Tim Burton to work his singular magic on the show. How could I tell? The quality contained in every episode spoke for itself. Netflix made an impeccable decision in choosing Burton to tell this story and tell it right.I admired how they covered Wednesday's emergent psychic abilities. They made her a heroine who didn't desire to follow in the footsteps of her parents - Morticia (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and Gomez (Luis Guzmán). Those portions of the script were compelling and credible. After all, nearly every young girl and boy will find themselves in a position where they need to express their own individuality. This plot-thread mattered in connection with Wednesday's motivations.Now, let's face it, Christina Ricci previously did a brilliant job capturing the heart (so to speak) and soul (again, in a manner of speaking) of Wednesday Addams. It therefore pleased me to see Jenna Ortega seamlessly recreate the character in this series while still giving it her own spin.Speaking of Ricci, I was enormously impressed and overjoyed to watch her being re-cast in the show as Marilyn Thornhill, one of the teachers at Nevermore Academy. It spoke to Ricci's humility and versatility as a person and an actress to even have said yes to the role. Then again, when Tim Burton calls, any creative soul will answer.Two schools were in focus in season 1 of ""Wednesday"". Nancy Reagan High (initial portions, anyway) and Nevermore Academy. Both brought their own admirable elements to bear on the script. As for Nevermore, it gave off distinct Hogwarts vibes; if Hogwarts were American and smaller. Nevertheless, every inch of Nevermore was 'awe-chitectural' eye-candy to me.I also liked the older-sister vibe Wednesday brought, especially how she took care of her little brother Pugsley (who gave an interesting performance, btw).As for Catherine Zet-Jones, she paled (pun unintended) in comparison to her predecessor Angelica Huston who owned this character in subtle and sensual ways. However, Zeta-Jones' emotional scenes were something to behold. Luis Guzmán was great as his own kind of Gomez but, again, he lacked the energized je ne sais quoi Raul Julia originally brought to the character.Their younger versions, though - Gwen Jones as Morticia and Lucius Hoyos as Gomez - gave us criminally brief moments of the classic goth-couple vibe that fans have come to adore about these two iconic characters.Fester was a mischief-crazy addition to the cast, but he wasn't given too much screen time this season. Lurch (George Burcea) was interesting and looked the part, but was barely given screen space. I was looking forward to hearing him give that signature exasperated moan, which never came.Gwendoline Christie as Principal Larissa Weems was a perfect fit for this franchise. I've always been a fan of her work, so I was glad to see her shine in this role.The storyline in ""Wednesday"" 2022 was neat and elegant. It evoked ""Addams Family"" moments I remember cherishing when I watched the 1991 movie (directed by Barry Sonnenfeld) and the 1992 animated series that aired on Cartoon Network.Back to Wednesday's psychic capabilities... This was new. It wasn't exactly confirmed in any of the other characterizations of Wednesday over the years. The way they delivered this plot-point, especially the style with which they used Wednesday's newly blooming psychic skills to lend her an air of gravitas and power, was splendid. I thought I would come to dislike this inclusion in the overall story, but I ended up giving it my vote.In addition, Wednesday proved to be quite the detective, particularly when it came to solving a series of monster murders - the creature was known as a ""Hyde"" - that took place around Nevermore. Making her a savvy sleuth truly elevated the show from anything that came before it in the Addams-verse. Instead of sardonically or sarcastically pointing out the obvious, Wednesday instead found opportunities to collect and connect clues to help solve serious issues.They even gave her character a nice literary touch. Wednesday writing novels as a hobby was captivating, to say the least. Her fictional cases were conducted by a girl-detective named Viper De la Muerte who was quite like the author herself in several regards. In addition to moments like these, so many other features in the show displayed a flair and fervour for traditional old-school ""Addams"" wordplay and tropes.From martial arts to fencing, cello playing to classic line-deliveries, I loved everything about Wednesday Addams and Jenna Ortega's take on the character in this Netflix series. Her dance in E04 was groovy (word intended), The Cramps' ""Goo Goo Muck"" soundtrack was perfect, some evocative steps from past Wednesdays made me fan-scream, and the ""Carrie at the prom"" finish (especially in regards to Gwendoline Christie's contribution) was brilliant!Also, I managed to guess the identity of the Hyde monster early on, but Burton and company wove their red herrings so cunningly that I could never quite be sure until the actual reveal (rather, bold-faced confession) happened. It was simple but effective misdirection worth admiring.Superb characterizations all round, captivating back-stories, and noteworthy pacing were some of the many elements that made this show an iconic production to hail from Netflix this year.Final Notes:In just eight episodes, Wednesday proved that capturing the old ""Addams Family"" magic was not impossible if summoned by the right hands. I do believe that Tim Burton made this Netflix series work in more ways than one. Christina Ricci did not disappoint, either.The series contained a little bit of everything, from school-time sentiments and crime-drama tropes to horrors and comedies galore. It portrayed the Nevermore alumni as a batch of oddities and outcasts, who included vampires, werewolves, gorgons, and sirens. All of it gave Netflix's ""Wednesday"" multi-pronged possibilities to use in future.By the time season 1 ended, I was genuinely weighed down by sadness to realize it was over and that Netflix was yet to greenlight a season 2 of ""Wednesday"". Hopefully they will, and soon. Otherwise, in classic Wednesday Addams fashion, someone is going to have to drop a bag of live piranhas in the executives' private swimming pool if only to remind them they have a great thing going here.",9
"I was so surprised at how kiddyish this show was. I knew it would be a generic Netflix show with their typical style and flavours restricting it from being anything too original, but I didn't know just how ""Young Adult"" and silly it would be. I guessed every single twist and every single reason for everything and I wasn't even trying. It was all too obvious. The monster looked laughable, and the drama... Honestly this show reminded me of Stargirl or something else from the CW. It's rated 15+ but it's just SO kiddyish and silly. The character Wednesday has had everything interesting and kooky about her stripped away and now she's just some Daria clone who just talks without emotion and has no other defining character trait. This looked and felt way too silly for a show supposed to be for older teens and adults. It's feels like a show that was made for a 13 year old girl. Extremely unsatisfying show that took everything fun and kooky about Addams family and just made a Netflix cookie cutter Riverdale/Stargirl clone that is predictable as heck, and insanely kiddyish.Ps. Take a shot every time someone says 'Patriarchy' in this show or any other Netflix produced series, and you'd be dead. Bonus shots for 'mansplaining' to really seal the deal. Seriously, Netflix is cringe.",4
"It's good... as an entertainment.The series doesn't do what it proposed to: Show the teenagers how to deal with themselves. But that doesn't happen. It proposed to be so amazing and have that nostalgia taste for the older ones and lessons to the younger ones, but it doesn't. The show just looks like a homemade movie inspired in Addam's Family. There's so much information in a short period of time that we can't process so many plots. We need to have notebooks to write down the wide range of loose ends. As a teenager show, the route tries to have created a romantic air, but never has a conclusion in it. No matter how the show tries, just make it's worse. The show tries to adapt the history of a really deep character, Wednesday, opening she sides wide, as being gothic and also adapting itself to the colorful ambient. The show tries so hard to do it that can't take deeper the act of Wednesday or none of the characters, making them so egoistic as their original generation's and so egoistic as the crew generation. The Show fails to represent teenagers in general that seems the whole series has been taken out of American Pie or, as the show promotes, TikTok videos. The series just confirm to the public how a big production can't show in a real form how the so-called ""Gen Z"" is. The performance of the cast is amazing, but doesn't is in the right place.They should pick actors and actresses literally with 12-17 years old, as it was supposed to be. The job of cast that was picked was excellent and express the stereotype that all people are all the time trying not to be.",5
"So I binge watched Wednesday and finished it Thanksgiving morning.I thought it was utterly brilliant.Jenna Ortega is incredible.While keeping Wednesday's stoic facial expressions, she does a phenomenal job of communicating through her eyes, the emotions being the stoic facade.Emma Meyers Enid was the perfect counter to Wednesday. The bubbly colorful roomie was perfect.The adults were well cast. It took me a little time to adapt to a Gomez Addams that wasn't Suave and Debonair like John Aston or Raul Julia.The mysteries were the perfect tool to drive the story.I can't wait for season two!",10
I've always liked the Adam's Family. Mainly the black and white tv show but I have to admit this was pretty entertaining. I pretty much binge watched it with forced intermissions for life. Tim Burton has always been one of my favorites but lately had fallen off my radar. I was a huge fan of Beetlejuice and the Keaton Batman movies and this gave me the same nostalgia. There is definitely a strong pull to the Adam's Family of old but this is definitely an update with a woeful flair. Jenna Ortega was simply terrific and Christina Ricci was a wonderful nod but also refreshing to see how quirky wonderful she is. I also have to admit Fred Armisen is not my favorite actor but as Fester he was amazing. Hopefully this continues ........ The END?,10
"After watching the trailer, I was excited to see where Tim Burton and Danny Elfman were going with this and it is without a doubt, one of the best series that Netflix has ever put out. The dark and intertwining juxtapositions of everything that one has ever seen either on television or the movies in the realms of horror and history is packaged in a beautiful symphony of the macabre, including dark laughs. Jenna Ortega is the find of the 21st Century. Her portrayal of Wednesday Addams is dead on and magnetic to watch on the screen. Now we know how that sweet girl in the TV series became what she is today and Ortega delivers it hook, line and sinker. The storytelling keeps you captivated and never idiotic or redundant in it's delivery. I am glad that Luis Guzman's portrayal of Gomez is reflected from the comics, not even insulting the fans who loved John Astin and Raul Julia in their roles as Gomez.Catherine Zeta Jones's portrayal as Morticia is great and relish every scene she is in.I have only watched one episode and I will stand by my review until the end. I hope that this series continues onwards in further seasons. I hope Netfilx delivers the 2nd season during Halloween, it would be so appropriate due to the nature of the show. Thank you Tim Burton for great direction and Danny Elfman for a music score that ranks as high as his previous works such as Batman and countless other Tim Burton movies.",10
"I have been looking forward to this show ever since it was announced, especially when I heard that the great Tim Burton would be at the controls. Well, let me say to all of the Tim Burton and/or Addams Family fans out there (which are legion) that you are in for a treat. This show is funny, scary, mysterious, suspenseful, and - above all - incredibly entertaining. Yes, the stories are completely ridiculous and make very little sense, but you won't care because it's so much fun to watch. Most of all, though, the biggest credit for the greatness of this show has to go to the amazing Jenna Ortega as the titular Ice Queen. Her performance is easily Emmy-worthy. Make no mistake - put this show on your must-watch list as soon as you can.",10
"First, let me say that if you're looking for the comedy and playfulness of the original TV series or the movies (I haven't seen the direct-to-video version or the cartoon), you'll be looking long and hard. There are some comical moments, some outrightly silly and some dark humor, but ""this is not your father's Oldsmobile,"" as the saying goes.The casting of Ortega was magnificent. She captures the spirit of Wednesday and does display emotion sparingly and only when appropriate. Catherine Zeta-Jones was a nice Morticia. I was unhappy with Luis Guzman until Wednesday breathed a sigh of relief at his acquittal (I won't offer a spoiler about it) and said she was sure he didn't have it in him to be a murderer. The look on his face was priceless. It was an almost, ""Well, I'm happy you're happy, but I thought I was all scary and such."" I think I laughed harder at that look than at anything else in the show.It's a good mystery, a fair bit of horror, and a good dose of dark humor and sadness mixed into a thoroughly enjoyable outing. Since it ended on a small cliffhanger, I am hoping it doesn't get the Netflix axe treatment that so many decent shows seem to be getting. I look forward to a season 2 and am eagerly awaiting to see if they can capture the same spirit they started with.",9
"It's Tim Burton's magical touch that transforms us into a spooky yet beautiful world of Wednesday where everything is black and white for her, He made sure that we all get carried into his world of spookiness and enchantment and yet mortal world.Wednesday stands tall on her terms, which sparked the likeness of others towards her.The emptiness of her soul yet empathy towards the end adds tremendous magic to the show,
And the reason I fell in love with her character.All the supporting characters are well played to add more value to Wednesday's life.It's about unconditional love, friendships are pure and simple.",10
"I started watching it because of Jenna Ortega and without knowing what to expect from the series and what it was about, but it was unexpectedly good and interesting, I recommend it for everyone who's interested in mysteries and sci-fi. It's the best adaptation of the Adams family, like I was never interested in movies which were related to the Adams family before but this series is different a lot better then the movies out there and other adaptations about the Adam family. It's entertaining and grabs your attention from the first episode till the end.I am hoping for a season 2 and more, loved it and it was worth my time.",10
"I did not expect to like it so much. The story got me curious from the very beginning, I watched the TV series in 2 days. Now I have to wait for season 2, I hope it's coming soon. The actors were great (can we have a moment and appreciate how fine Tyler is? Thank you). I was surprised (and also happy) that it was filmed in my country, Romania. Eugene is my favorite character and I hope he gets more screen time in the following season.Jenna Ortega did a wonderful job playing Wednesday, she is an amazing actress and I hope she will get other bigger roles too. She truly deserves it.Please give a chance to this TV series, it might surprise you as well.",10
I really didnt know what to think before I started watching. But I started watching and could not stop. So I watched it all and its great. It has that odd fuzzy feeling to it that Tim Burton movies have about them. But well all 8 episodes. What I remember from addams family it seems to be lore friendly it has a few absolutely lovely easter eggs for the sharp eyed viewer. The characters are fleshed out and do thing for a reason and arent just stupid for the sake of the lore like in Chilling Adventures of Sabrina. There is a villian or two and they are fleshed out too and not just bad for the sake of lore. Also the villiand arent overpowered like in many fantasy series so it kind of makes sense. Oh and the acting was great too. Ortega is great as Wednesday and Myers brough great contrast to the show as Enid. Also costums location and filming all great. And the thing is still my second favorite thing about the Addams family.,9
"I was pleasantly surprised by how great this series turned out. It truly does keep you guessing with enthralling mysteries and adventures, and it adapts the Addams Family franchise in such a fun, creative way, though I never had much of a connection to it prior to this viewing. Wednesday and Co. Are very likable characters that you want to stick around for, brought to life by an incredible cast. There are some characters and plot lines that could have been developed better, as well as some of the humor being somewhat repetitive. However, I really want to see more of Wednesday's Nevermore experiences in a 2nd season.",7
"Hit play by accident on this one. Glad I did.This was nothing like what I expected. The remake movie was not appealing at all to one who grew up with the Addams Family. This series doesn't imitate the movie at all.The actress who plays Wednesday did an amazing job of carrying the whole series. She started off coming across similar to Jeri Ryan's portrayal of 7 of 9 but by the end of the second episode had well and truly made it her own.This version is less child friendly than the movie and the original as it is quite dark, but having said that, there's little in there that's not suitable.Half hoping there's a second series coming and half not, as they won't top season 1.",9
"Beautiful and interesting title of year. But in 1st episode they make 1 sad mistake which does not fit in my head. When the girls are brought, ostensibly, a black orchid, we see something like an aster. Not even Orchidaceae. A very stupid and painful mistake for normal viewers. After all, you can literally buy an orchid in a store, at least paint it black. Or God bless him, plastic.I hope there will be no further such mistakes, because according to the Addams, to do something suitable is to have experience and skill.I hope there will be no further such mistakes, because according to the Addams, to do something suitable is to have experience and skill.I will stick to principle until the end of the season. So far they have few competitors. Yes, and on New Year's Eve, good luck)",9
"I was a big Addams family fan growing up, could even say Christina Ricci's Wednesday might even have been my first ever crush, i was excited by the trailer and have been looking to see how the show turned out. I have to say i was very amused with this show. Jenna Ortega nails Wednesday maybe even more than Christina Ricci did. Great story keeps you guessing untill the end. Great supporting characters wasn't sure about it at first but its really well done. Some great cameo's and good choice for Gomez and Morticia too. There's room for more let's just hope it's as well thought out as this one can't wait to see more.",9
"Wednesday, the gothic daughter of the Addams family, is getting her own mini series on Netflix - how does the young Addams do, since she is a misfit even in a school for misfits? Jenna Ortega is the perfect choice for playing Wednesday.Bad, sensitive, especially towards her brother, a bad wolf, rational and talkative in black and white - that's one The Addams Family fan knows and loves Little Wednesday (Ortega)! But she also needs to be successful and above all to reach her full potential. Nevermore Academy should take care of her, where her parents met and fell in love...Growing up with the Addams family, I never thought a retelling of the beloved family would be any good.Dang, I was so wrong.Even the idea of the thing was in my perception boring in todays day and age.Boy, even there I was wrong.Just watch and make up your own opinion. It really was touching me in creepy ways...",9
"Surpassed my expectations. Beside the fact they did Morticia and Gomez dirty, the show was overall impeccable. It had been a long time since Netflix made such a good series. The plot was unexpected and quite interesting. The whole story made you work your brain cells to try and find who the murderers were. It was very entertaining and not cliché which is surprising from Netflix. I loved how Wednesday never got really soft or had a major character development. She stayed true to herself, I enjoyed her character deeply. The way she didn't care and openly admitted to it was a first. It was like all those others maim protagonists who pretend they don't care, she truly didn't and it was amazing.I strongly recommend watching and hope for a second season.",10
"The first trailer had me interested, the cast and creative team had me intrigued, the first episode had be hooked and the final one has left me yearning for more.Jenna Ortega who plays the lead of the show - ""Wednesday"" herself, brings such a unique performance to the role yet makes it feel nostalgic and reminiscent of those who came before her. Speaking of which, it was incredibly smart to bring back Christina Ricci for a role in this show as a nice easter egg for the fans of the prior. Ortega fully embraced the character and ""became"" her on another level. Time for me to check out more of her work for sure!The cinematography is very ""Tim Burton-ish"" with a modern twist to it. You can feel his directive presence throughout the entire show. The writers did an incredible job as well to take an already existing iconic character - which is a bold move - and dive deeper into her personal story and life. The music and sound design was also very much like the theme of the show and the previous ones. The nailed the atmosphere and overall vibe for me really well.I was afraid at first that they would ""normalize"" Wednesday too much. After all, I feel she should remain an intriguing and morbid character with surely a lot of underlying depth underneath her deadpan witty personality. She was exactly that in this show and I'm very happy about that. Wednesday remains to be an absolute boss, as she should be. She was humanized in subtle ways and with slow steps without forcing any narratives or uncharacteristic traits.The acting was pristine. Jenna Ortega was the perfect pick for the role and she crushed it. Her co-stars manage to not disappoint either next to a presence like hers. Gwendoline Christie's character surprised me a lot. Her performance (subtle emotion, motivation, traits) elevated her character and transformed her from a ""somewhat"" antagonist to a beloved, awesome figure whos presence was constantly felt throughout the show. I was also presently surprised by Hunter Doohan and Emma Myers, whom respectively play Tyler and Enid. Great things await these brilliant actors.I thought the casting of the other Addams' family members was just perfect and worked well as an addition to the show. The way ""Thing"" moves and communicates brought back some very nostalgic feels, I love It. The twists were great and some more unexpected than others. The detective-ish theme of the show had me hooked from the beginning 'till the end. I truly hope they'll release more seasons, which I assume they will since this show will no doubt break the internet. Not doing so would woe my mind.",9
"If anyone is on the fence about watching Wednesday, watch it, it's very good, the cast, direction, plot and style are all excellent except for two things.Gomez and Morticia are awful, awful actors acting awfully and completely miss the passion of the characters reducing them to the effect of teenagers in the back of a pickup truck, but thankfully they aren't in the series much.Morticia doesn't spark the dark sarcastic cold note of the character but hams it up not in a good way.Gomez is a parody of a great character who is meant to me stylish, debonair, witty, clever and focussed on the love of his life being everything. This character depiction is reduced to stupid hair, acting like he's a teenager with raging hormones and awful one liners referring to Wednesday. It's an awful depiction in my opinion.Thankfully they are only in the series a couple of episodes and I'm hoping that will continue in series 2
I cannot imagine that there won't be a second series as there is so much to love about it.Enid and Wednesday are perfectly cast as are the rest of the crew and the plot will twist and turn sufficiently to entertain and make you laugh etc.",9
"Very well made ! Excellent story line with lots of parallel story lines to keep you on your toes definitely not just another teenage show it's beautiful and complex displaying lots of topics including change growth friendship and relationships I love how they made it relevant to today and now with the little gen Z slang. Spot on when it comes to casting ! Specially when they show their younger "" selves "" . The cast did an phenomenal job acting all the characters the vfx are brilliant. And to top it all off the music and sound effects were my fav part of it all ! I had to pause and search the sound tracks! Can't wait for the next season ????",10
"Had high hopes for this as I love the Addams Family films, but this series is just terrible.It doesn't have any of the dark humour from the films, apparently the directors washed it down for the overly sensitive generation z for fear they will attempt top copy everything done in the film in real life. You can really tell it is washed down, to the point it is terrible.The setting of the series feels like a complete rip off of the Harry Potter story...
A school for unique kids (vampires/werewolves) instead of wizards.4 school societies, just like harry potter.A championship between the societies, just like the quidditch game where people tried to sabotage other teams.Pugsly is portrayed as a wimp instead of the confident prankster.The casting seems poor too, gomez and tich had no proper romance between them, it seems very cheesy. They are also normal parents, ashamed of their kids bad behaviour instead of proud of it.Also, why they made Luis look so weird I don't understand.Wednesday, a sadist and social recluse starts making friends and has romantic feelings towards someone... This alone screams it's watered down for overly sensitive young kids.Very disappointing overall.",1
"Wednesday is Tim Burton his young-adult take on the Addam's Family story and it shows. Everything about this show feels alive and kicking. From the surprisingly cool murder mystery story to the set designs, customes, music and even the faces of the actors, everything just works to bring the absurdity to life. Blending the over-the-top world of this spooky family with Burton's masterful macabre abilities feels like a masterstroke, quickly elevating this to one of Netflix their current top shows.The support of castmembers such as Zeta-Jones and the original Wednesday Christina Ricci certainly helps, but it's young Jenna Ortega who steals the show effortlessly. Her ice-cold depiction of deeply sarcastic Wednesday Addams is of Antarctic-freeze levels and will leave you all warm and fuzzy when watching her bend her entire world to her dark and brooding will.A must see for any Tim Burton fan and anyone who loves some dark comedy really. It's alive.",9
"I've grown up with the Addams family and watched the show BEFORE it went into syndication :)I read some of the BAD reviews and almost didn't watch the show but glad I did. I binged it in one day because I had to know who the monster was.I found it entertaining, intriguing and well acted. All the nuances of the original Addams family such as the ""You rang""... the double snapping of fingers... and even the night time angles of the school looked EXACTLY like the Addams family mansion.I gladly look forward to more seasons of this show and hope it continues.Only those who want it to be a replica of the original series will be disappointed.",9
"As Wednesday Addams begins at her new school Nevermore, she finds herself attempting to thwart a series of monstrous killings all while attempting to navigate her new relationships at school.When I heard that Tim Burton would be directing and producing an Addams family spinoff starring the phenomenal Jenna Ortega as Wednesday Addams I nearly fell out of my chair. It immediately became one of my most anticipated shows of the year and after finishing it did not disappoint.Jenna Ortega has possibly the most potential amongst the younger actors and actresses working today and to see her in what looks like the role she was born to play is truly incredible. Every scene she is in is phenomenal, and her ability to take over a scene with showing basically no emotion and focusing on acting with her eyes and body is phenomenal.Burton is known for his dark, gothic style of directing and it shows in this first season. Every scene involving Wednesday is given a feel unlike the rest. Even if they are in a place such as a coffee shop or a classroom if Wednesday is present Burton adds a gothic style that is perfectly well done.The plot itself is a well written mystery. It keeps you guessing throughout the season as clues are discovered and killings continue. My only real issue with the script is the the writing for some of the side characters. I found that anyone under the age of 18 who is not named Wednesday were not super well done. When the story shifted towards a character for the purpose of a subplot rather than using them within the solving of the mystery I found that I was less interested. That being said if they were used in the context of the mystery I didn't mind their character and thought it worked well. Enid on the other hand is an exception to that, I thought she really worked as a counterpart to Wednesday and I felt her subplot was well handled. It was characters like Bianca, Tyler and Xavier that I felt could have been handled better. The older side characters on the other hand I really enjoyed. Gwendoline Christie as Larissa Weems is amazing, there is one scene in particular where her and Wednesday are in her office and she gets a little agitated and leans towards Wednesday it gave me goosebumps.The final thing I will touch on is the use of the entire Addams family. I won't go into into spoilers so I'll make the blanket statement of I liked the castings and I liked how they were used.Overall Wednesday is everything I wanted it to be, a great showcase of Tim Burtons style using a childhood classic piece of fiction all while Jenna Ortega gives what may be her best performance to date in a well written murder mystery.8.5/10

"But I just can't with Netflix « vision ». And I hope the show was written according to Jenna Ortega as the lead. And not JUST to have her in it. I don't know if she's the only gifted young actress these days, or if being a Latina gives her an advantage in the industry. But she kind of works as this rereading of the Wednesday character. That being said, I really don't get why they picked an actor who could play Fester, as Gomez. But I guess it was also Netflix way of « rebranding » the franchise. Nothing bad to say about Zeta-Jones, though. She's perfect and gorgeous as Morticia Addams. And the little bro, is just too irrelevant to care. Now, I won't lie. The premise sounds a awful lot like all of the platform's teen fantasy series. And as entertaining as this one can be, it lacks originality. And is surprisingly tame coming from the anything but commonly Tim Burton. Maybe he just signed his name, and left it to other people to develop the concept. Which would explain a lot. But I can't honestly suggest this to people who loved the movies. Or warn them to not expect to find any ressemblance with it.",1
"A centrist view of the Addams family designed to not offend and to average out competing expectations.Plot was a bit slow and weak as well as unnecessarily
convoluted. Luis great as Gomez, Morticia not so much, but who can touch Ms. Huston's portrayal anyway. Unfortunately the main acting problem is actually Wednesday herself. I think the script and or the direction made her too strident, not enough of the fantastic dead pan we saw with Ms. Rici.. Also Wednesday's interest were never so conventional, and teen angsty. Trying to appeal to the widest possible audience I suppose under the guise of well she is older now? I don't know. Just not a good switch from her esoteric almost random interest and penchants to a laser focused Nancy drew. Doesn't fit character or the Addams in general.Let the haters begin, this is just my opinion and I am still glad to have seen it and recommend it. Just don't think it is all that and that it could have been made much better with out too much being done differently.I respect other point of view.",7
"I sat through this because my wife wanted to watch it.It's not the worst but it's very drawn out.It's Harry Potter meets the Worst Witch meets Sleepy Hollow meets Colombo.I won't go into too much detail but my wife and i cracked the case by episode four out of eight.There are the usual twists that are either predictable or convenient and since Cristina Ricci is in it, it was unfortunately predictable what her character became.The final 'Boss Fight' with the pilgrim guy was rubbish and the character was fairly laughable and somewhat of a contradiction as to his motives and abilities.Also, leaving the show the way they did in final scene wasn't necessary, leaving it so open to another series.Even Tim Burton stopped caring and didn't direct all of the episodes.If you want a new angle on the Addams Family then by all means give it a watch but you won't be missing much if you don't.",6
"Other than using the Addams family name and a few characters from the original show - this series is absolutely nothing to do with Addams family. It's absolutely awful, such a childish teenage show that's so obvious at every turn. How this show is getting the praise it's getting is beyond me. The monsters look ridiculous! The stories are laughable. The only thing that's actually good in this show is Jenna ortega as Wednesday but even shes not enough to save it. Such a pathetic attempt to use an old name and turn it into something new. It's basically the same as every other teenage show Netflix creates and what makes it worse is the fact Tim Burton had anything to do with this abysmal series.If you enjoy this show and you're over the age 18, please ask yourself why?It's terrible. Typical teenage bullS##T.",2
"My family really likes how the creators are making his show their own and not sticking with the traditional Adam's Family. Jenna Ortega is an excellent Wednesday! Awesome special effects too with how they created Thing with it's personality and relationship with Wednesday. It's really cute and unique. Unfortunately, though we are not fond of the actor that plays Gomez. He seems to be trying to act to hard to fit the character, but it just feels off. The chemistry at the start of the show with him and Jones really seems uncomfortable. Like every show there are up's and down's, but this one is still excellent. We hope Netflix can take this show further with several seasons.",8
"The script was just abysmal, making mediocre performances even more mediocre. Wednesdays character had promise but poor execution.I know it's hard to act bad characters and the writing left so much to be desired, but the performances felt like they'd be more comfortable on Nickelodeon than a series designed to be dark and uncomfortable.It was unclear where Wednesdays line of creepiness was, and the idea of the men following her round with their tongues lolling out was reminiscent of a fanfiction written circa 2007, uninspired and unbelievable.Premise of never more also confusing regarding whether it was meant to be a known or unknown secret. Had to stop watching I couldn't bear the cringe.",1
"Perfectly morbid, superb acting throughout and smooth! I enjoy anything with Jenna Ortega is quite talented and she's great as Wednesday based on Adam's Family. Tim Burton is masterful at weird/intriguing characters that are excellent to watch. The bulk of the time I use other services, this is a perfect reason to use Netflix. I love that this is focused on young folks, anything bizarre and beautiful 4K quality colors. Quite surprise form Tim Burton a lot of his projects didn't have much horror, mostly Sci-Fi, adventure, and drama. Wednesday is a pleasant surprise after all the promotions I've seen I highly recommend it!",10
"The Addams Family was FUN, this show is not fun - far from being a fun comedy.Misandry. Definition: dislike of, contempt for, ingrained prejudice, or hatred against men. Is this all that Netflix knows how to produce these days? Gomez is a fun and romantic man but here he is just creepy - all men are weird and creepy in a bad way while the females are weird in a good way.Wednesday is not the lovable Wednesday Addams that we know and love but a dark angry girl. The core of the plot is the empowerment of a condescending anti-social aloof angry toxic teen female with an attitude of superiority over everyone else - bravo. Wednesday does not provide any sort of a positive role model for young girls.The writers today do not know how to create, only to destroy.Shameful Netflix, shameful.BTW - what is the anti-Pilgrim discrimination?Anti-religion propaganda?",4
"So the Acting is alright for most and great for the main characters. The Tim Burton vibe is rocking it! The teen highschool drama predictability is breaking it slightly! They should tone down that part.Now this does still make it remain a 9,4. Tim Burton, the main characters, sound effects and visual effects are just that good!Hopefully they turn down the typical teenage highschooldrama for the next season. This series does not need that cringe to fill the series. They should have the main storyline in the hands of Burton but maybe this is the place to experiment with the teenage highschool drama theme. Not changing the two main characters though that story does just work.",9
"""Wednesday"" - is the reincarnation of the ""The Addams Family"" created in 1938 by artist Charles Addams. For the first time, his creation was published in the form of a comic book and was published in The New Yorker magazine. Screen versions appeared on the big screen in various forms: films, series and animation.""Wednesday""Tim Burton, known for his love of the gothic style, is behind the latest adaptation of the life of the Addams family. He called the young talent Jenna Ortega for the lead role, and also made the cast recognizable with the help of Gwyndolyn Christie (Game of Thrones) and Christine Ricci (who played Wednesday Addams in The Addams Family in 1991).PlotWednesday Addams is expelled from another school for ordinary people. Wednesday's parents find the only solution to this problem and send her to a school for outcasts (a school for people gifted with unusual abilities: werewolves, nagas, vampires, etc.). According to Addams, this school will not teach her anything, and she is going to run away. But on a fateful night, she becomes involved in a mysterious story that she intends to unleash.The relationship of the characters fuels interest in the plot. History is full of betrayals, distrust and secrets. To unravel the mysterious tangle, Wednesday will have to go against her principles, which distinguish her from all the outcasts.ConclusionWednesday isn't just a mind-growing teen show. Everyone who looks will find lessons for himself that will be useful to him in life. Also, the picture is seasoned with black humor, which will appeal to many and excellent soundtrack.",8
"Spooky, funny, and entertaining. Jenna Ortaga as the Adams family character Wednesday was fantastic. She was smart, stoic, and an absolute gem. The mystery she eventually solved almost killed her but she still managed to catch the culprits and save the day. Just like in Scream the killers were somebody she knew. Jenna has already became one of my top favorite scream queens, along side Neve Campbell,( my absolute favorite) and Jamie Lee Curtis from Halloween. My hope is that Jenna gets another season with this show because I think more creatures could be told and also because it's a masterpiece.",10
"I love this serie, (hope for more) the Wednesday interpretation by Jenna Ortega is expectacular and the side characters are great. The Addams are one of my favorite of all time and Tim Burton directing is a need to see!!!!The story is about Wednesday adventures, a book story to be published. The ""friends"" Wednesday have and the past stories she discover were great. Some mystery to solve and some lives to save.Nevermore Academy is a good theme for monsters and outcast to ensure more chapters in this series.I really recommend this series and enjoy watching it. With only 8 chapters is a great weekend view.",10
Just watched WEDNESDAY for the THIRD time. It really was a fun adventure and the beautiful friendship between Enid and Wednesday made me cry like a baby. I loved every episode but the finale was superior. Tim Burton didn't disappoint he never does. Gwendoline Christie is one hell of a woman she is a Goddess. I really loved her in this.DANNY ELFMAN! I love him I listen to Batman Returns soundtrack weekly.I also love the Easter eggs to past Burton projects.I'm a Halloween baby that was always called Wednesday because my black braids. I still wear them to this day watching Wednesday. Loved this!!I know let's make another season!!!,10
"Wow, what a wonderful adaptation from the original movies.This series strikes a wonderful balance between the dark gritty feel of the Netflix Sabrina series, and the world of wonder, colour and delight from the first Harry Potter movie.All the actors do really well in bringing their characters to life. Needless to say, Jenna Ortega brought her A game and did an amazing job.Took a bit of time to get used to the way they depicted Wednesdays parents. I know they're based on the original comic but I was expecting to see the flamboyant Gomaz and expressionless like Morticia Adams. But I must say that the quirky warmth plays well to Catherine Zeta-Jones. She did a good job portraying the loving but complicated relationship between a mother and a teen.Luis Guzmans' portrayal of Gomez was good as well, the character grew on me especially after I watched the series for a 2nd time (it's that good).The only thing I feel could've been done better was the Hyde monster.I hope the series comes out with a second season, and they keep it true to this first season, slightly bright and maintaining the development of All the characters and storylines.",10
"I'm new to writing reviews, so bear with me.... Tim burton at his best! This was non stop intrigue from start to finish! Jenny Ortega is the perfect embodiment of a more mature Wednesday. Loved Christina Richie, always have. So glad she was a part of this project. For those of you like me, who are not always a fan of straight horror, give it a try. It's horror drama with beautiful splashes of dark comedy, and the nods to other adaptations makes you nostalgic. It's a sweet mix of Stranger Things and Harry Potter shown through the macabre eyes of Tim Burton. My only complaint was to see Gwendoline Christie's character leave so soon. It was great to see her again after Game Of Thrones. She's statuesque and a beautiful actress. I binged the entire first season in one day, and I guarantee you will too! Can't wait for the next season!!!",10
"The fact that Tim Burton was not the director of the two films from the 90s' is quite surprising. I'm amazed it took this long for him to do any sort of adaptation to the Addams Family.The premise is very simple. Wednesday is sent to an outcast school, Nevermore, and attempts to solve a series of murders by a monster within the school.For those looking for a project that reflects some of Burton's early work, this is it and it is the perfect style for this type of show. I love the set designs and the cinematography is tremendous for a show like this.This is a show that is really driven by its cast. Jenna Ortega is wonderful as Wednesday, giving a very hilarious deadpan performance. Catherine Zeta-Jones is a surprisingly perfect Morticia. Luis Guzman is an odd yet humorous choice for Gomez. However, my favorite performance, outside of Ortega's, is Gwendoline Christie as the Principal Larissa. She so delightfully creepy, that she fits this show like a glove.There are only a couple of minor problems with the show thus far. For one, some of the shows scenes with the teenage characters can come off as rather formulaic. Also, one of the highlights of the original source material and the two films from the 90s' was that the rest of the world contrasted the Addams family completely. The real world in this show is very much Tim Burtons version of it, which sometimes doesn't differentiate itself enough from them.So overall, a great show that really brings Tim Burton back to his roots as a filmmaker. If you are a fan of Burton or just the Addams Family in general, you will love this.",8
"I thought Wednesday was amazing, I just can't get enough. I grew up loving the show, animated series and the movies so I was surprised to see quite a few people complaining but I noticed one thing in common; they want the same old 9 year old wednesday when she's 15 now so of course it's going to be a little different. But it still has the Addams Family vibe and she's still Wednesday Addams.Overall, it's my favourite show this year. It has mystery, suspense and a plot twist at the end. Go into it with an open mind and I guarantee you'll love it. Also holy crap I did not recognize Christina Ricci at all!",10
"I loved it!!Jenna Ortega did a spectacular job, the story is awesome, the Addams' family vibes are exactly the way we know! Wednesday's dance was something that we didn't imagine we needed hehe. Thing is on point too! The whole suspense about it getting attacked really got me worried, uncle Faster appearing was an amazing surprise and it was in a special moment, seeing Wednesday so vulnerable with him because of Thing was very special and important. She's such a great character, Jenna definitely slayed!! The romantic scene about watching a terror movie was also splendid, her personality is super well written.",10
"Its really complicated, the ending was a Disney ending as you know it, but the rest of it up until then was fantastic in my opinion. Wednesday is becoming more and more outgoing, making good friends with the others but staying very true to herself which is good. Shes also getting less pale than she was before, whether that just came across to me or was just like that to show that she had changed in the face of feelings etc. Put aside. The episode was really good the ending left you wondering why they released the villain why didnt he kill anyone with the staff so nobody was ever really hurt and the headmistress was just killed straight away even though she had great potential and could certainly fight, the potential was not used which is tragic. But you can still leave the ending as it is, Im looking forward to the next season and I hope that mistakes like those made by the headmistress or in the final fight dont happen again, otherwise the series was really good.",9
"The expected hauntingly macabre humour and the dark mischievous wit is no where to be seen. It's too tamed, too soft, too dull and too blandly predictable to be enjoyable. The show has sucked out every bit of morbid sense and left it with a generic vanilla teen murder mystery show. Emo girl wannabe detective with her unknown powers and her trusted preppy side-kick, trying to solve a + something years old mystery and you guessed it - a Prophecy involving her, dun, dun, duuuun....Honestly it's like Veronica Mars meets Scooby Doo meets Monster high, set in a dupe Hogwarts. I suppose I should be thankful that they didn't make her an orphan to the boot.Honestly hard-core Addams fans know that the paranormal and supernatural is something that was supposed to be uniquely Addams. Their whole charm was that they were the oddballs in a normal world. Wednesday being in a society of likes makes it less whimsical and more bland.To think that I had such high expectations for something that turned out to be nothing but a lackluster G-rated teen fantasy.This show could have had soo much potential and yet it was squandered away by its too many non-Addams characters. Not even Jenna Ortega, who was doing an admirable job as Wednesday can save this show. Tim Burton has lost his touch.",1
This show is absolutely perfection in every way possible but I have to reduce 0.5 score because of the terrible CGI monster it looks so bad it literally looks like they reused the head from Snake Beetlejuice hopefully next season will have a bigger Budget because the major secession already of Wednesday I've already re watched it 2 times personally. I don't know whose idea it was the cast Jenna Ortega as Wednesday but I applaud you and not to mention the villain is played by the original Wednesday from the movie. I love this series so much and I'm just waiting for season 2 it better come because I might throw hands.,9
"Binge watched it in a day and already want to watch it again. The whole cast was amazing! Jenna Ortega killed it (pun intended) as Wednesday! Every episode kept my interested and there was never a dull or boring moment. I wish I wouldn't have watched it so fast, but after each episode I couldn't stop myself from starting the next one. It looked good in the trailers but I didn't have high hopes because Jenna Ortega had big shoes to fill. It definitely blew me away and went beyond exceeding my expectations. Kudos to the cast and crew on their amazing work! It kept me guessing and on my toes. I'm hoping there's a season 2!",10
"Tim Burton's sense of the dark and Ms Ortega's surgical skill in deadpan delivery make this an explosion of smart, fun escapism. It is as effective at creating an alternate/undiscovered reality as the Harry Potter series.Cliches approach, and then are dashed. Lots of stereotypical characters are introduced, then the cover is opened to reveal the book inside. So aside from all the deliciously morose humor, the mysterious monster, and tension between the townies and cutters (ref: Breaking Away), is the wonderful and sometimes painful interaction of the students as they themselves grow and sometimes grow together. Aside from the ones that die.",9
"You'll like this if you liked ""Chilling Adventures of Sabrina"", ""Riverdale"", and other cookie-cutter CW supernatural teen dramas. I'm not personally a fan of those shows, but I have seen them and can confirm that the plot of Wednesday is simply a reorganized retelling of plot-lines from those shows.Although I didn't like the show, I know not everything is meant to appeal to everyone and so I'd rather give a mostly optimistic review for my negative experience. Some of the few ways this show exceeds those other teen dramas, is the show knowing it's simplicity, the devotion to the autumn aesthetic, some songs that are overplayed in mainstream movies but they're still good songs, and giving us a slightly different protagonist even if it's a very basic Gothic ""weird girl"" type. I can't make this review without talking about the writing, and I simply can't sugar-coat how awful the writing is. It felt like the writers intentionally inserted cliche phrases, barely researched concepts, and googled ""uncommon words"" to over-complicate very basic terms which just stood out. They put all of that into the script like a madlibs game, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and excuse it as a maybe rushed project. With how horrible the writing was, I'd like to focus the attention on how Jenna carries the bad dialogue and softens the blow making it seem not so bad with some of her delivery. She does her best to make up for the incompetent writers who did a horrible job, but she in her role, couldn't fix their short-comings. The bad writing is more apparent in the side characters who truly feel like extras due to how little character they have. Even the love interest has the personality of a plank of wood so when the forced relationship happens, the protagonist just increasingly looks dumb. There's so much more I can rant about, but I feel like I got my main conspicuous complaints off my chest.",4
"Great watch, full of twists and turns. High level of unpredictability and keeps you entertained. It's dark yet light hearted with comical moments. The perfect balance of mystery, drama, dark, fantasy and comedy.Great acting by Jenny Ortega, her character is intriguing and quirky. They nailed it with this spin off and have revived the Addams family for these modern times. Caterina Zeta Jones plays Morticia and Christina Ricci plays Thornhill's character. Great cast & plot.You could binge watch it in a day or two, super awesome. I hope they make a few more seasons. I Look forward to season 2.",10
"... I would have skipped this after E4 (the one with the extremely cheesy highschool dance)... The series has much promise, but dabbles WAY too much in teeny soap. Jenna kept me watching, she's got a ton of charisma in this role... BUT: then they take away all that by evolving her character from everything that makes her interesting to just another girl infatuated with the handsome artsy guy... who then hands her an Iphone for saving his life... that's bad on so many levels... This series could have set a counterpoint to mainstream, instead the protagonist falls in line. If there's a second season and it picks up where this one left us, I'm out...",6
All I honestly have to say is that who they chose to play Gomez is terrible. Where's cancel culture when you need it? He doesn't fit the bill at all. Out of all the Hispanic actors they could have use they chose a 3rd rate actor? What happen to a Gomez that's accurate to what he's supposed to look like? I feel as if everyone else was a great casting choice. The choise of Wednesday was 100% perfect. The casting for Morticia of that's how you spell her name was also great. Heck Pugsley was even incredibly casted. Lurch is possibly my favorite character casting in the show. He is 100% casted. What does everyone else think ?,8
"I thought this was a really fun, and interesting take on Wednesday Addams. It has much the same feel as teen dramas like Riverdale and Sabrina (which I enjoyed), but without the sex, cursing, and never ending meanness that pervades those. The acting is great, and the writing is high quality. There are a bunch of twists, so although you may guess the ending, you can still enjoy the ride.My husband complained that she was not as biting as in the Addams Family movies, but I think that's a good thing, it would be hard to maintain that level for eight episodes centered entirely on her. .You follow Wednesday as she tries to solve a series of murders at her parents' alma matter, which is now her boarding school as well.Tim Burton maintained the humorous tone the Addams Family is known for. It has a lot of funny or lighthearted moments without being slapstick.",8
"I started watching this show with anticipation having seen the trailers before it's release on the streaming platform. I loved the classic tv series and the previous films with Raul Julia. But the more episodes I watch of this new Tim Burton produced series, the less interest I had in continuing. The production quality is good and expected given Tim Burton is directing it. But there is just something off about the tv series that make it so different from the previous Addam family shows. I didn't care for the X-Men like school of odd balls or the ScubbyDoo Mystery at the heart of the film. This show just had too much of a Disney vibe to it, especially with the casting. Yeah, this wasn't for me but perhaps it will appeal to the newer generation who grew up with the X-men, Umbrella Company comic book films. Sad, because I thought the first episode was good. I like what Wednesday character did at the pool, that was funny. But the mystery behind the Hyde monster, not so much.",4
Jenna Ortega is a star. Depthful acting for a challengingly one dimensional role. The supporting cast is excellent. I was truly surprised to be charmed by the whole thing. Jenna also manages to be quite alluring as Wednesday.I don't know if this is a second season show or where it will go if it does but it is a truly satisfying series in one season. We have done the family so I suppose it being Netflix a second season is inevitable.I had seen and not really noticed Jenna in the Scream reboot/omage. She was good and cute and strong but I didn't really see her until Wednesday. I think Charles Addams would approve.,10
"Grotesquely engaging and darkly funny. The timing and dry comedic writing is cleverly superb. It's like Hogwarts meets Xavier's school for mutants meets Adams Family with a sprinkle of Twilight.Just plain fun all the way around. Excellent job of casting Jenna, Catherine was good as well, but honestly Luis Guzman should have been someone else. I guess Banderas or Javier Bardem wasn't available? Sigh.The story does get a bit confusing as they add more and more backstory to the storyline, but at that point just watch the pretty pictures!It's believable and will keep you binge watching for at least a few hours if not days.",10
Well....this was just amazing from start to finish. I normally pride myself on being able to guess the killer quite early on but this had me guessing and re guessing all the way through. Fabulously written and even more fabulously acted...particularly well done to Jenna Ortega who is by far the most talented young actress out there at the moment.Jenna played the most incredible and believable Wednesday Addams so far.Move over Harry Potter...there's a new magical and mysterious world that everyone will want to be a part of.This HAS to have another season and then another and another...please.,10
"Everything about it is done perfectly, the entire cast, crew, set (I read on here that it was filmed in Romania, wicked cool) everything about this was just perfect; the black cello, the macabre, the monsters, the murder mystery, the dedication of the fountain with Wednesday playing cello, snap twice, Thing, costumes, the half and half glass window, the cello solo in the first episode, I know that I mentioned cello thrice but it was Awesome. I am gonna get that song she plays outside her room for my ipod. Thank you all for doing such a wonderful job with this show, whomever was involved, it is perfect.",10
"Such a good serie, really captivating. Watched the entire season in one night. And CAN'T wait for season two, if there's even one... But it has to be, right?Love her very own dark character, on the other hand wished she was maybe a little more dark and murderous but in her own ways? Those of you who have seen the series understand.Recommend this serie to everyone, can also be seen as a child as it is not too scary and bloody. My little sister aged 7 and my mum aged 48 loved it as much as I did aged 22.Will probably have time to watch it one or two more times before season two is released, and I will!However, they need to make the monsters better, the monster (without too much of a spoiler) looked terribly cartoonish. That is the only thing that drags down the ratings and, the end (those of you who know, you know) that person looked ridiculous and not scary at all.",10
"A lot of twists but not all that complex, just shifting the uncertainty around and never any doubt that the ""good"" guys would win in the end. Jenna Ortega is brilliant as Wednesday Adams. Easy and breezy and visually stunning with a Tim Burton twist. Better than most shows I've watched on Netty-flix. I hope there's a season 2 with a bit more darkness and bite.It's funny that the show seems to borrow from legally blond, a girl out of place in a new school, smart but in unfamiliar surroundings. It borrows from a few high-school tropes, which sounds kind of cheesy, but Jenna and Tim Burton make it work.I still think the show is missing something. When it's all over, it feels like it was more of a flashy appetizer than a meal, but still very good. Solid 9 stars.",9
"Loved the show. Didn't care much for Uncle Fester as he seemed like an unnecessary distraction. There were a few moments where her attitude felt tedious but overall, a perfect rendition of the wit, ability and fearlessness of the Wednesday Addams character. Jenna Ortega did a masterful job as the stoic young woman where slight nuances of facial expression were subtle but expressive moments of character development. I enjoyed all the performances and the story line was engaging enough. I remember watching the original Addams Family TV show and this in depth story on Wednesday was a worthy rendition of those characters and a lot of fun to watch.",8
For the life of me I cannot figure out the absolute terrible takes that the rotten tomatoes website has on actually good TV shows and movies. They literally called this a CW show with Wednesday Addams. I was shocked because I'll be honest this is probably the best experience I've had watching a show on Netflix since the first season of stranger things. Not only is it one of the best shows I've seen this year but it's probably one of the best things that Tim Burton has done in a very long time. Jenna Ortega is the best part of the show but all the other characters are extremely likable as well and nobody is perfect. Which is also the thing that I like the most is that everybody in the show is flawed. It's not super over the top cartoony dark like some of the movies are but it takes a little bit more of a realistic approach with the Addams family personalities and relationships. The Burton monster elements are still there though and they are awesome to watch. If you look at it more through the angle of Wednesday trying to find empathy and a reason to care about the people around her you get a lot more out of it. So for me personally I really don't understand why snobby critics just accuse us of being a cheesy teen drama with a consensus that you would see on CW... because it has a lot more to say than those types of shows and it's also very smart in the approach that they have with the Addams family and their relationship with each other and the people in the town that this takes place in. Please give this a watch this is a good show!,9
"Let's start saying that this series, finally, pushed me back to the ""binge watching"" feelings.Lately, nothing caught me up like this.Well written, the characters are perfect and (forgive me), Wednesday is lovely!(Inid too)But:It was advertised as a ""Tim Burton' series"".. at least he directed 3/4 episodes.. for the rest, just an executive producer. (Better like this.. I don't like the late Burton's style)Truth is that is a Millar&Gough's creation!Great soundtrack selection!!!(Just to mention..... Apocalyptica..)
Elfman's theme is greatAnd it's a very good creation!!!WATCH IT!!",9
"I really wish they would make a movie or series involving the Addams, that was just the good ol' dark satire and humor, but without trying to make a political statement!This series at it's core is basically kind of a fun whodunnit! With little tidbits of humor thrown in once in a while.The acting was really good as you would expect from a Burton directed show. And the cinematography was really good also. With lots of beautiful New Englandish fall colors.Netflix did a really, incredibly exceptional job with the Enola Holmes movies. Wednesday is kind of along the same lines, but not nearly as much fun. And the added political and social commentary took away my enthusiasm for show. I wound up not really caring who dunnit and just wanted the last couple episodes to just end.",6
"The acting, soundtrack, imagery, dialogue, and characters are what you'd expect from a Tim Burton production. It's comforting, yet somehow strange, that Tim's style and tone are still consistent so many decades later. If you have enjoyed any of his work in the past 2-3 decades, you'll thoroughly enjoy this show, even if you must ignore the plot holes and repetitive storytelling techniques.There aren't a lot of negatives I have to say about this show, but it feels obvious that Tim doesn't know how to do a TV show. The writing becomes thin as it drags and tries desperately to find cliffhangers and stretch the story to the next episode. The number of times someone goes in and out of the local jail and is almost expelled but then forgiven, or something ""terrible"" may or may not happen to whatever character gets ridiculous in the last few episodes.I hope Tim continues to the second season and figures out how to write several unique episodes that organically tie together. Unfortunately, each episode just started feeling repetitive; the only thing keeping me engaged were the characters and their various arcs.Beyond that, as many have already said, Jenna Ortega is Wednesday, Addams. It's also nice to see other Addams family members pop in and out of the show. It would be nice to have at least one episode in the Addams family house.I look forward to a second season, ideally with a better story and plot.",7
"Didn't really like it but I wonder beside brand name why use Wednesday Addams?It would work much better as a new character, because this is not Wednesday or the Addams family for that matter, at the heart the Addams were always about familiy and while they had a weird lifestyle they were all good at heart, Wednesday is cruel not only strangers but also her parents and even Thing one of best friends.Of course Wednesday is not a real person so she varies from adaptation to adaptation, but she is just really unpleasant and boring, using a lot of time for some forced drama of what she is not, its just boring.",3
"I think this is my first review on here. But, I'm going to keep this quick and simple like the title. Watch this - for a clever intertwined story. It's been forever since I've watched something so well written.Read beyond this for spoilers:
Although, avid film and Tim Burton fans may pick up or make some educated guesses. The way the story is written and woven together is beautiful. The way it keeps shifting and revisiting little snippets is fantastic.The only bad part is when Crackstone comes back and legit looks like ""The Leprechaun"" haha. I personally loved it and found it funny, but it was in necessary. If he had a spell bound he could have looked normal or like anything, but they chose the make him a 6ft version of the. Leprechaun hahaha.",10
"Was expecting just an Ooky, Kooky kind of show in the Addams Family tradition. But I started watching it, and ended up binge watching the entire season. Jenna Ortega absolutely embodies Wednesday, she was amazing in the role.The whole story line was very interesting, and, in most parts, flowed well. It lags in a few spots with some of the tertiary characters stories, but that's a minor complaint.The only thing that grinded on my nerves was the casting of Luiz Guzman as Gomez...he didn't fit the role at all. Not meant to be a shot at him as an actor, just not for this role. Though his role in the series is minimal, it took me out of the story whenever he appeared. Fred Armisen.as Uncle Fester makes up for it...he was hilarious.If you're looking for fun and entertaining show to watch, I highly recommend this one.Jenna has my vote for an Emmy on this one.",8
"WOOW WOW WOOW! To any fan of this story, the original, believe me when I say you won't be disappointed at all. Tim Burton, Jenna Ortega, Christina Ricci and the whole cast & crew did an amazing work! I won't deny it, I was originally worried the original essence of the story would be lost 'cause recently a lot of revivals are not delivering what you originally know of them; and WOW! I've known the story since I was little, and I loved every single minute of this series. You can still feel the original essence of it with the perfect modern twist as if they, the Addams family, where truly alive.",10
"My only review is I am loving it. I love mysteries, and this was not at all what I was expecting. Jenna Ortega is so good, her ability to act without any emotions is awesome. She portrays Wednesday so well. I hope there is another season. I can tell Tim Burtons imagination was greatly involved. It was perfect for Christina Ricci to be in this, what better then the best Wednesday to be in this. It is a typical high school kids environment but with a twist of supernatural, monsters, comedy and mystery. I don't know what took them so long to make this. Unfortunately, only Wednesday was cast well.",10
"A real gem of a show but I am afraid to like it too much given the tendency for Netflix to cancel original content after one season or, almost as bad, taking YEARS to come out with another season.In short, this is better than anything ""Addams family"" that I have ever enjoyed. It sort of reminds me of Harry Potter but with a much lighter story. It's quirky and funny and just generally a blast. I can definitely see kids dressing up as Wednesday Addams for Halloween this year. The quiet little girl of the original television series has been fully developed into the best part of the family. I'm not too keen on Gomez Addams but the rest of the gang is awesome! Watch it and you won't look back.",9
"This adaptation relies almost entirely on the nostalgia of the Addams family.Firstly we are expected to believe this is a school for outcasts but you'd be forgiven for forgetting this as we rarely ever see why the students are outcasts/gifted. The contrived way ""Woe"" was included in every title with clumsy puns was embarrassing and unnecessary, this isn't Friends.Obviously Wednesday is portrayed as a continuation of her original character - a cold stoned hard ass- but none of her actions are worthy of this portrayal, she is consistently being saved by everyone else; Edin, Golly, Eugene, Bianca, literally everyone and she still has the gall to say lines like 'this isn't going to end well for you' microseconds before certain death if it hadn't been for all her saviours. I loved Harry Potter but this was my main gripe with Harry and his almost exclusive use of the expelliarmus charm BUT at least he never pretended to be a cold stoned hard ass.Then there's all the build up of the plot only for the main villain to be easily defeated, despite his superior strength and powers, thus having a minuscule amount of screen time, without any significant death, destruction or consequences. She even needed major help to eventually discovery who Laurel really was, she had no idea who Laurel was before Eugene mentioned the red shoes (after already incorrectly accusing the psychiatrist and Xavier), what if he hadn't have woken up or woke up after she got on the train (oh yeah the Hyde would have intercepted and killed her). There were at times comical moments but few and far in between and they eventually became predictable and clichéd.Usually a big fan but woefully disappointed in Tim Burton with this adaptation, he probably should have retired a while ago with his legacy intact. People have watch this due to the original Addams connection but this will be quickly forgotten, if they release season 2 (of course they will, they always bleed cash cows dry- the end?) it will take a noise dive in ratings as it won't be as nostalgic and the storyline is dead. Some of the acting was good, writing was ok.",4
"I was excited about Ortega playing this role. She'll do it well. Zeta-Jones is perfect for the role as well. Guzman is the worst possible choice for the role of Gomez. Gomez Addams was never a repulsively ugly and creepy character. The original Gomez may not have been insanely handsome, but he wasn't repulsive. He was debonair, suave and still good looking. He didn't make you cringe when he obsessively fawned over Morticia. This actor is just slimy, creepy and repulsive for this role.As far as Pugsley goes, I have nothing against the actor. He seems fine. What I have an issue with is the writing of his character being emotional and weak. Pugsley was never a crybaby. I fully expect this to be dark and twisted (after all, it IS Burton and that IS what the public craves) so it should be well done. I just can't bring myself to keep watching Guzman in this role.",3
"There's absolutely nothing new Wednesday adds to the genre. It's the same cliche story you've heard a thousand times already. A coming-of-age story of a teenage girl that turns into a Nancy Drew murder mystery. Seriously, how many times has this been done at this point? Not only is the entire plot a copy and paste from the last ten stories that have done it, the writers couldn't have even bothered to put any decent twists into the story. I'm not going to explicitly state any spoilers in this review, but you should be able to solve the mystery on your own before you get to the final episode. It's a 4/10 because the only unique thing about the show is that this time they decided to cash in on the Addams family, which is a franchise that needed more love, but it definitely deserved better than this Navy Drew, Harry Potter knock-off.",4
"We can all walk into this knowing it will never compare to the movies from the early 90s, so let's get that out of the way.Wednesday is a writer, a fencer, a cellist, a ninja, and a seer. Sounds kind of badass, but she's more b*** than badass. She doesn't have any likable traits, at all. They've tried to recreate everything about what made Ricci's portrayal of Wednesday so iconic, and overdo it to an extreme that made her so unlikable.Also, The casting for this show is really subpar as most of the actors included have mediocre talent, at best.They've managed to make all characters, especially the MAIN character so unlikable, it's not even worth going past the first episode.",1
"What Chilling Adventures of Sabrina COULD'VE BEEN. (i'm joking obviously)It's like Tim Burton watched Chilling Adventures of Sabrina (Part 1, the only part of that show that's worth watching) and said to himself ""I can do A LOT BETTER!"" And he SUCCESSFULLY did.The similarities are as follows: Pilgrims. Witches. And pilgrim witches. A look into a strange past involving pilgrims burning witches. Visions. Visits from spirits. Ghosts. A boarding school in the woods for supernatural students. Outside a small town that is mostly toxically patriarchal, filled with small-minded town folk who just want to appear accepting in a shallow way, while covering up/just forgetting their history with teenage boys being bullies and causing problems. A strange and mysterious destiny that seems inescapable to the female protagonist who believes they are evil or might become evil in the near future. The female protagonist has a very supportive family. The female protagonist has a complicated relationship with their mother (or mother-figure). The female protagonist has a teacher that is even more supportive, telling her whatever she wants to hear in an obviously grooming her kind-of-way. The female protagonist rejects ""normal"" and has no real interest in s*x/physical relations in the way her family has taught her. The female protagonist likes to do things and handle problems ALONE, but will put her friends/loved ones in mortal danger. Takes her loved ones/friends for granted a bit. She likes to challenge authority. Witch hunters. A love interest that is a normal boy who helps her although he doesn't know much about the supernatural, what she's planning and is also somewhat afraid/spooked of the supernatural with a dead mother and strained relationship with his father, and for whatever reason seems to be interested in the female protagonist. A semi-love triangle with normal boy (who wears a lot of plaid) and a boy who's not normal, immediately interested in the female protagonist, popular, strange and suspicious. A mean girl who has a history with the supernatural love interest, is in choir and whom becomes an ally. A best friend to the protagonist who has her own struggles but is mostly positive and is also supernatural. In the end something supernatural happens that makes the protagonist ""fall out of love""/walk away from the plaid-wearing love interest and returns to strange and suspicious love interest who is ""more her kind"". Oh, and a brother (or brother-figure) that the female protagonist is close to. And a sidekick who will help her with whatever, especially spying, and is not human.End of joke.LOVED this show. I was surprised to see that Morticia Addams was a little less darker than I'm used to, and also she doesn't speak French. And the whole family is Latino (?) I think.The whole cast is very talented. I do hope that this isn't one more show that Netflix goes ""oh the cast isn't completely/mostly white? Well we can replace that with something else, we're sure it won't be missed."" THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE SHOWS LIKE THIS ONE. For the sake of the baby goths of the future generations (joke) but no seriously, I really hope there will be a season 2.The only real flaw was that it wasn't longer (felt a bit rushed near the end), but Netflix rarely gives more than 8 episodes to something with a big budget like this one. I CAN ONLY HOPE THAT SEASON 2 WILL BE PICKED UP QUICKLY, and maybe contains more than 8 episodes this time.I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT.",8
"I'm giving it a 10/10. Sure some things were predictable, but you can't deny this series was seriously good. The casting/acting, the plot, it all worked so well. I really enjoyed Jenna's portrayal of Wednesday. She did a wonderful job. I loved how prominent ""thing"" was. I loved the no bs lines & subtle inclusiveness that allows this show to reach a wider audience. Plus throw a classic love triangle in the mix and I'm hooked. I wish there was a little more of morticia and Gomez, but alas this is called ""Wednesday"" for a reason. I really hope this gets a second season! It's definitely great as a stand-alone, but with how well it's already been received, I think a second season is well deserved. Another win for Tim burton in my book!!",10
"I grew up loving the Adam's family, so I was looking forward to this show since it was first announced, and man did it deliver. The cast was perfectly chosen. Ricci is hard to forget as Wednesday, but Ortega was made for that role. Her dark sarcasm hits every single time. I especially loved that they casted a Latina, since the Adams are Hispanic in the first place. The show was just so much fun! Wednesday's growth through the episodes was such a blast to witness, she is hilarious. Honestly, props to the writers and directors and literally everyone involved because this was an absolute hit! I liked it so much that the silly cgi can be easily overlooked. I can see this show and this version of Wednesday becoming huge. I recommend everyone watch this, you won't regret it. The bad reviews are from people who are stuck in the past. You're allowed to enjoy a remake without it taking away from the originals, if anything this adds more to the past characters we loved. Give it a chance!",10
"I don't know if this was based off the cartoon or the original tv show (the remade movie with Huston and Julia was similar to the TV show. I know nothing about the cartoon except seeing some ads for it a few times. But the Gomez in Wednesday looks similar to the Gomez in the cartoon. So when I make any comparisons it will be based on the tv show and the Huston/Julia version compared to Wednesday characters.First, Gomez, horrible casting except he looks like the cartoon. In the TV show and the Huston/Julia movie you could feel chemistry between them. Huston gave a dark, somber version of Morticia which was similar to the original. Julia was the suave and lovestruck Gomez. Gomez is OK in most of his roles but a suave and deadly with a sword type he is not. Zeta Jones just doesn't have what it takes to be a Morticia. She was an OK actress when she was in her prime and IMO her looks carried the lackluster acting. To be honest both are too old for the roles.Wednesday did a good job of being the dark and cynical Wednesday. You could picture her as the younger version from the TV show. When she went to the dance and actually danced I thought that is out of character and then I remembered the episode in the original where she was showing off the latest dance craze.Uncle Fester was a fairly decent reproduction of the original. Pugsley I was not impressed with. Lurch...Well what can you say about a character that mainly walks around and groan. While it was funny in the original it just doesn't seem like Lurch. I wonder if we will be seeing Cousin It and Grandmama in future episodes. My only question was other than being weird what was the justification for the Addams going to Nevermore? Supposedly Thornhill was the ""first"" normie at the school. They have vampires, werewolves, sirens, gorgons, shapeshifters and other things but I don't believe they have ever said what the Addams are.Anyway, if you liked the original then Wednesday is a good reproduction if you overlook Morticia and Gomez. Now if this was based on the cartoon and that is how they are like that then forget this whole ramble :) But for some reason I picture the Gomez cartoon character as more like a weasley Igor type.",7
"IF NETFLIX BREAKS MY HEART BY NOT RENEWING FOR SEASON 2 I WILL NAIL GUN THEIRS. ??I loved Addams family as a child. I grew up adoring my favourite, Morticia Addams! But damn, I love Wednesday and Thing now!Obviously it has its own weaknesses here and there, but as a whole it was lot more interesting and cool, actually made me binge watch!Sometimes it was hard guessing who was behind all of that, but sometimes there were also predictable moments. Yet it was awesome and was saved by breathtaking performances!Yeah, you have to be a little weird to like our Kooky and Spooky Wednesday! Anyhoo she doesn't care if you don't! ??",9
"I give it 5 for all the visual production values. If this series would've been called ""the adventures of goth-girl, starring Thursday Maddams"" it would've been okay, maybe a 7. But this is NOT THE Addams Family. It's a travesty. They ""harrypotterified"" the concept of The Addams Family, and almost all the characters are nothing like their counterparts from the sixties OG series or the 90s movies.And maybe because there's one key element lacking: humor. At the core of TAF, even the original cartoons, lays humor. The blunt contrast between every day ""normal"" life and people and the Addams' weirdness. And all that is completely missing in this series.The story is ok, but kind of very predictable, as it is with many products these days.The cast is almost ok, very much like the original cartoons, but there's something missing. I guess maybe Raúl Julia's Gomez settled the bar very high. This is not an argument against Luis Guzman's casting, but the characterization is very far from what we've seen in the og series and the 90s movies. It's the same with all the characters, except foe Uncle Fester and Thing, although the last one also lacks some of the humor from the originals. Jenna Ortega does a very fine job as the titular character, but she's written almost flat. Well, I mean, the original character, especially the one from the first movie is almost a punchline, and is better fleshed out in the second movie. In the end, she's just ok.Tim Burron and Danny Elfman are mere shadows of their former selves. They could've hired anyone as director and the results would've been the same. Maybe the hired em just for the weight of their names.Bottom line, this series it's just another ""big mac"". Another burger combo made for streaming. I'm baffled with so many uber positive reviews, but be it, it's ok, watch it if you want, but it's just another proof of the lack of innovation and imagination in a decaying medium, and it's consumers' taste.",5
"Let me prephase this by saying I loved the Addams Family movies. The 90's versions were my favorite and Wednesday was among the top reasons, if not the very top.Now with that out of the way this series is just amazing. Everything from the plot, to the atmosphere to the repartee is extraordinary! My only issue is the casting of Gomez and it's got nothing to do with anything that the current actor did, it's just... Everyone's a step down from Raul Julia. I'm sorry but when you've seen the best, it's kind of hard to stomach anyone else in that role. Having said that the rest of the cast did a great job especially Wednesday herself. Whoever decided to cast Jenna Ortega is a genius. I can't think of anyone more perfect for that part and she delivers perfectly.10/10 this is how you revive a show the proper way.",10
"I love the person acting as Wednesday. She did a great job and couldn't do better. I know a lot of people are talking about how this is like Nancy Drew. It kinda is but... well, there is Thing and Uncle Fester there to help with that. Thing and Wednesday carry the show. Uncle Fester is just the icing on the cake. The only thing wrong is the people acting as the parents of Wednesday and her brother. I'm looking forward to season 2. I have already watched all eight episodes twice, and I'm looking forward to watching them again. It got me hooked and I had no idea who the killer was. I had some questions, but I researched them. I'll put them down below in case you guys are wondering the same thing. Don't look if you haven't watched all eight episodes!What powers did Eugene have? He can control bees.How did Crackstone have powers if he hates outcasts? His staff has powers.What are sirens? They can control the sea and are mermaids when underwater. They also can sing and with their song make you do things or think things.Why did the monster kill Rowan and not Wednesday? The teacher needed Wednesday on a blood moon for the sacrifice.I had no suspicions about Tyler except at the end. I knew that Tyler was a bit odd, but the scratches on his belly when Wednesday and Enid and Tyler went to investigate the Gates house set me off track. I have watched this series two times now, but still have questions about the third episode. At the very end, Wednesday was talking about how she didn't believe in coincidences. The screen showed different scenes of different people, like Ajax turning to stone while Enid was getting mad and was attacking the bus out of rage. It also showed a scene of the principal and the teacher, and those I didn't get. What do those scenes have to do with coincidences?I'm sorry if this review contained spoilers. To be honest, this is the best Tv show in the world. It got me stuck in the house for almost 2 days straight watching it. I finished the entire season twice in around 3 days. I am so hyped for season two. If there is one, of course. I have another question though. At the very last scene, it showed Tyler transforming into a monster, because he is a Hyde. My question is, does Tyler need a master to control his transformation? If so, who is the master? If the answer to the first question is yes, then there will probably be a season two. I also love how Wednesday said at the end, ""I know the suspense is killing you."" That makes me think that there are more episodes coming, and I cant wait!",10
"I'll start this off by saying that i'm not super familiar with the source material, therefore I will be judging the show on its own and a standalone piece of fiction.This show is unbelievably bland and generic, the protagonist is an overly edgy teenage girl whose response to everything is ""i will kill you and murder you ahahah"" who hates her mum like every other teenage girl and doesn't wanna be like her. She's written like a protagonist from a self insert wattpad fanfic written by a 13 year old girl.The other characters aren't exactly riveting either, they're pretty bland and generic and fit into personality archetypesThere are very cringe references to pop culture along the lines of ""You should post on instagram, snapchat and tiktok!!"" that kinda just seem to scream ""these kids are hip and topical"" but only serves to make me cringe.The special effects and CGI are noticeably not great x everything looks especially fake and like it doesn't belong but I understand it has a budget of a netflix original and not an MCU movie, but i've seen originals with better CGI such as Umbrella Academy.Overall it feels like this show was made to market to preteen-teenage girls and is not especially riveting or engaging.",3
"How could anyone compare to Christina Ricci's Wednesday, I thought going in to this. Jenna Ortega nearly did, possibly would have if the story didn't focus on her, and she could have just deadpanned one-liners here and there like CR's Wednesday did. But since the show is all about her, well she's darn awesome. JR is definitely my second favorite Wednesday behind Ricci. Which is saying a lot because Melissa Hunter's 'Adult Wednesday Addams' was pretty amazing as well.I won't give away any spoilers. I'll simply say this is a must see entry for any Addams Family fans. I like Luiz Guzman's Gomez better than John Astin but not as well as Raul Julia. Catherine Zeta-Jones is servicable as Morticia but no one will every be able to own role as Carolyn Jones did, and Anjelica Huston was a little more enjoyable as well.The supporting Nevermore cast were all quite good as well. Do yourself a favor and watch this. It's fun, even if you aren't a Addams Family junky.",9
"Teens written by middle aged YT men just needs to stop. This feels like a higher budget CW show that stole from Harry Potter. The darling unique and charming Addams family are made pathological and weird.I love Luis Guzman, but due to makeup, hair and costume choices, his Gomez Addams is grotesque. Catherine Zeta Jones as Morticia is lovely, in spite of costume design that isn't glamorous or very flattering. She is a passionate, energetic actress and so I did miss the more cool and regal self possession of previous Morticia;s (just my personal preference). Sadly the best thing about the Addams isn't portrayed well for most of the series... their love and unconditional support for each other and unity as a family. More emphasis was placed teen drama that makes no sense (such as Wednesday despising her mother).In the show a line reads ""I've always hated the term 'write what you know'"" and some thing about stifling creativity. That feels like the motto of the writers on this show (and sadly many others streaming today) where ""creativity"" seems to mean pulling poorly planned series out of your a$$-pirations.Wednesday is skillfully acted and really, really fun to watch, but she's written with such discontent and often malice. And they felt the need to write her an origin story??? Wednesday doesn't need an origin story, she is a fully formed character by nature of her family. It's quite insulting.It was uncomfortable seeing Mortician and Gomez act apologetic and embarrassed, not to mention absolutely having no chemistry. Pugsly is written as if he is an afterthought. The principal is fantastic & one of the better creepy elements of the show. Most of the other actors are very well done.One last thing that really bothered me are the gross jokes and innuendo throughout. Enid is made the butt of some especially crude and disgusting jokes. Fred Armisen is especially abrasive and you're left wondering did he write or embellish his own jokes??",1
"This show has very little to do with the original Addams family show or the movies from the 90s. I don't know whose Wednesday this is, but I don't recognize her mannerisms, actions, nor aesthetic.The beauty of the Addams Family was that it was an eccentric family living in the normal world. So choosing to place her in a school for outcasts defeats the whole point. What was anyone thinking while making this?Love Jenna Ortega as an actress, but her face is too conventionally beautiful to be Wednesday. They should have casted someone with a quirkier look and essence. She relied on these Gen-Z esque quips to show how eccentric and cold she is. Television and movies seem to have lost the art of ""show, don't tell.""Catherine Zeta Jones and Luis Guzman were so unsexy, I don't recognize them as Morticia and Gomez. No chemistry.What's with the teen romance being so prominent here? In Addams Family Values, Wednesday and the outcast boy like each other at the end, but it was more organic, not shoved down our throats from the beginning.However, aside from this baffling portrayal of Wednesday and the family, it is a well made show. I was able to finish watching the series. So if you like teen shows of the 2010s and beyond, you'll enjoy this. I do not like this category, so I personally hated this show.Also, it was extremely predictable. Good luck!",6
"This is..... disappointing. That's it. Very very. To be honest I wasn't hyped for the movie cause i already knew it was not going to be to my taste. Netflix adapting Addams family. It was going to be a waste of time. But then I actually watched it and I felt new depths of disappointments. Turned the movie into a ""teen supernatural romance"" kind of movie and removed all the dark humor so as not to offend anybody? Lol. When did Pugsley become such a wimp. I couldn't even feel the love between Morticia and Gomez. I wouldn't too cause Gomez has never been a fat, ugly, creepy man. They are supposed to be a weird misfit family showing their love in their own kind of way to each other. But the parents are not proud of their children's behavior. I'm suprised with all the tens I'm seeing. I'll have to say they come from people who haven't seen the original. Cause this is definitely not the Addams family. This is some cliched teen supernatural romance where the weird girl falls in love. I'm done with this. I can't keep watching. Enjoy.",1
"""Wednesday"" TV series from Netflix is quite good. They even managed to keep the intrigue till the middle of last episode, which is quite rare nowadays. My only wish would be to have a better world-building, because it is almost non-existent here outside of the plot-related stuff. Maybe people more familiar with Addams' lore can better navigate it, but I have quite a few open questions about the world.Regardless, Ortega was good in the role, and I certainly would not mind another season. Luckily, the ending does suggest a possibility for one. Would not surprise me if it will get 3rd season, too.",8
"As there are so many positive reviews, I almost did not bother but that would be unfair to such excellent storytelling,, acting, set design and direction of this series.It is very worth of Bing watching as you try to solve the culprit or culprits through the series.Jenna Ortega steals the show as Wednesday and is obviously going to be a world class actress for the future. There are scenes where you just feel there is no way she could have kept the Wednesday poker face when filming them. I think there would have been a lot of laughs making this, The supporting cast are first class.Personally, I enjoyed the direction of the series both light for comedy value and dark when required. If you are not a Tim Burton fan this maybe a negative for you.I would sum it up as Harry Potter meets Fantastic Beasts meets Scobby Do meets the Adams family. An absolute joy to watch.Do I want a second series? Very rarely do I say this but yes please with even more mystery than this one.",10
"This series is a masterpiece. It has the right amount of everything, horror, action, drama, and the most difficult to get right which is black humor. Balance is the most difficult to achieve in this genre of series/movies. Personally, I found the original Addams to be too much of everything. Wednesday is dark, proper dark.Jenna is extremely talented and well suited for this role. I hope we witness her evolution through this series. The famous dance scene is a sight to behold. Tim Burton has also done a great job.The costumes are great, especially Jenna's outfits. The atmosphere, as well as the magic and mystery provide a harrypotterish vibe.One star is removed due to abuse of contemporary terms such as ""mansplaining"", but mostly due to the mass violence scene in the first episode. U. S. Schools have had enough of that already. Kids need to learn how to defend themselves and resolve their issues. Blind rage and violence is not the solution.",9
"Show wasn't bad. Just wasn't amazing. Zeta Jones had the right look, but didn't have the right mannerisms or attitude. Gomez was probly the best surprise in the Addams family. Wednesday could have been better, pugsly was weak. And of course netflix had to add wokeness into it on more than one occasion. All in all it was a decent watch. But I won't watch it more than once. Definitely not my favorite, and definitely not on par with the 90's version.Really had higher hopes for this show. And really had high hopes Netflix would do it justice to the original. But it fell flat to the movies. If you just take it for what it is, it won't be a disappointment. If you compare it to the movies, it's a complete let down.",6
"This show seems very specifically targeted for tweens. It is full of teenage drama. I decided to give it a try despite my reservations because the score was so high and Tim burton has made many excellent movies. This show should be on the CW. I can't believe Tim burton made this. It doesn't have that feel at all. It also doesn't have the adams family feel. At this point, why even make a reboot? Why even make something that already exists and change it until it's nearly unrecognizable? Where are the original ideas? I only could force 3 episodes because I was so bored and I hate shows about teenagers. The casting of Gomez was so awful it was distracting. I was literally cringing when his gargoyle looking self was trying to caress the stunning CZJ. Gomez is supposed to be smooth, handsome, romantic. This Gomez came off as a creep. CZJ tried. She was beautiful at least. Wednesday did fine, but so much of her charm, quick whips, and deadpan was missing mostly because her dialogue just wasn't funny or sharp like the original. If you have watched the original show, or the 1990s classic movies, you will probably be disappointed. This show feels more like a knock off Harry Potter. Don't believe the score, and don't expect much. If you can stand stupid teenage problems, this is the show for you. If you are a mature audience and love the originals, just skip it. It also can get a little preachy at times with its messaging. I'm guessing a lot of people won't exactly like the message. I didn't mind it, as I mostly agree with the views, but I'm just warning people.",5
"I have to say that I was a bit hesitant at first, scared it was going to be a standard Netflix flop. Let's just say I am positively surprised and it's definitely one of the best series of the year. Brilliant, funny, dark, a bit gory and beautiful visual scenes. The casted actors are just what I imagined the Addams family to look like, almost nostalgic, and they fill the role perfectly with a touch of individual personality. As the series progresses you really start to pick apart each character and every detail seems well thought trough, from costumes to scene lighting. I am already waiting for season 2!",10
"I just finished it, and it is really, REALLY good, undoubtedly the best new Series on Netflix. Lots of expectations when Tim Burton put his Name on this Series, but kudos to him and his Creative Team for delivering the Goods big time.It just so good on so many levels, first is that it is not only about the Dark Humor and quick, witty Dialogue, there is a lot of multi-level Storytelling also involved, giving most of the Characters a lot of depth.A lot of talk about how Jenna Ortega was absolutely perfect for the Role, but for me it just wasn't her, most of the other Actors and Actresses also did very well, helping contribute to just how good this Show is.Take Catherine Zeta Jones, for example. I wasn't sure if she was going to be a good Morticia Addams since Anjelica Huston in the Role was a pretty hard act to follow, but she delivered wonderfully, proving that she could indeed still be good in a Comedy Role.You know this Series will be full of dark, quick wit, but it still catches you wonderfully off guard at various moments every time it comes, like when Wednesday told Gomez she knew he didn't have it in him to be a Convicted Killer, then Gomez says he forgives her even if what she said ""stings"".The Soundtrack is also pretty good, something that is certainly noticeable, they were turning Classic Songs from the 1970s onwards into an Instrumental played by an Orchestra.SPOILER ALERT (Don't read this if you don't want Spoilers), I'm glad the previous Wednesday didn't just go into the Series in a Cameo Role but was in fact quite a Pivotal Character. We may even see more of her in succeeding Seasons.Anyway, this THE Must-Watch Series on Netflix right now, and looking at all the buzz it is generating it seems a lot of other People agree with it, too.",10
"Jenna has finally done it with this one everything she did in this show was amazing & fantastic she really surprised , shocked me with her acting in this i hope to see her in more bigger projects now since this one is becoming her biggest project yet good to see her achieving big roles & tim burton is finally back and set it off with this one as an major fan this is now one of his best projects aside all his amazing projects proud to see him back and giving us an masterpiece and can't wait to see what else he has in store for us and hope to see this receive a lot of awards. Hopefully we get season 2!!",10
"I never write reviews but for this one I definitely had to ! By far the best I have seen. It's so interesting that once you start watching you can't stop . Undoubtedly this is the best new series on Netflix. Jenna Ortega did an amazing job, also the other casts they too did so good , they just got so perfectly. With all the twists and turns , it keeps you guessing right through the series . Hopefully Netflix doesn't cancel it and hopefully there's more seasons to it .I can't wait for more .Thank you Tim Burton , you definitely did an amazing job . Honestly the bad reviews I don't get it. Personally I loved it .",10
"From time to time, you find a tv show that makes you spend a whole day consuming every second of it. It doesn't happen quite often, which, for a lot of people, is the point for considering if netflix is really worth the price. But with ""Wednesday"" on the catalogue, it's totally worth it.Maybe this is not a masterpiece that deserves a 10 star rating. If i dissected the show, maybe i'll find it's flaws. Nevertheless, what's the point? I loved it! Sometimes we just have to embrace a good show and enjoy it, without trying to look for ""mistakes"".I can say that i was felling pretty confident with my ability of solving murder mystery's, after reading countless books about it. But with every episode i had to reconsider my suspects. I had to finish the tv show in that day, because simply needed it to know the end!It kept me hooked throughout the whole time, and let me tell you, it's been a while since that happened.Wednesday is a must watch!!!",10
"What an amazing achievement this is. The casting is en pointe!! Catherine Zeta Jones is the perfect Morticia in this brilliant horror tale that will have you biting your nails in a delightfully tense way!Tim Burton has delivered yet another master peice; Wednesday is well portrayed as are the other characters.With utter brilliance, the story unfolds, interesting and draws you in from the start. The costumes and scenes are spot on and are the adding touch to a well written story.Lastly and but not least, how wonderful to hear the clever music of Danny Elfman who has eluded us of recent days, his score is awesome. The music compliments every mood of the series. Well done to all and thank you all so much.",10
"It is one of the serials that are started without expectations, to fill free time, but watched and finished in a single breath.It both took us back to our childhood and ended the season leaving a good taste in our mouths.And the tim burton signature already makes it one click ahead of other series.The series is a classic Tim Burton piece. It has become a watchable series with a cool character network that does not tire the subject, which is enjoyable to watch. Of course, there will be those who criticize, but the fact that even a garbage producer like Netflix could not spoil it shows how high quality the story is. I liked the lead character very much, I don't know if I internalized it because I found inspirations from myself, but the story drew me in a lot. I hope it continues.",10
"To be honest, this series is one of the best of Netflix. Jenna Ortega is fascinating in her role as Wednesday. She plays it so good that you always want to see Wednesday in every scene. Except that, all the characters, the topic, the places, everything is spot on. It gives a bit of a Harry Potter vibe with the school etc but it's definitely one of the best TV series I've ever watched! You might think the series seems childish or disney-like but i can assure you that I've thought the same at first but it definitely was something else from both Netflix and Jenna Ortega. Plus, we all know Tim Burton who directed this series, and we know he's extraordinary. Definitely worth the watch!!!",10
"Truly I wondered what this would have in store when I first heard about it. The first glaring problem I saw was the fact that it didn't even seem like an Adams Family edition. It did seem quite contrived for what it was. Almost all Netflix shows I've ever watched are beautifully shot, well casted, and has decent action. The only thing that they lack in is the writing department. This is no exception to that.It truly just seemed like another Netflix teen drama that is an unnecessary dissection into Wednesday Adams only to repaint a feminist icon into the new geist of what is today. A twist to add in all of your political criteria while bringing in the ethos of what many younger women feel they are today; intelligent, self-sufficient, witty, sarcastic, and with a little bit of angst and cynicism. I know this is how the character is in a nutshell more or less, but this rendition seems more Gen-Z and contrived compared to the nuance I think the character should have.If it was done in a film or mini-series format it might have sat better with me, but them turning it into a Tv show is where the unnecessary dissection really comes into the foreground. I'd give it a 5 for me but maybe for people who are actually less like real personality of Wednesday Adams, you might enjoy the watch.",5
"This is every other CW, ABC Family teen drama, nothing new, nothing special. Somehow they made The Addamses boring, except Wednesday, which in this version is a stereotypical whiny brat teenager. They don't think too highly of the audience either, everything is dumbed down to the lowest common denominator, then spelled out and repeated just in case it went over your head. Charles Addams made comics that were separate from the norm, the 60's show brought them into the ""suburbanite"" world and highlighted them as different from the 9-5 husbands and housewives, the 90's movies rewrote Fester's backstory and added to Gomez and Morticia's physical and emotional attraction, this makes Wednesday look dull and especially vanilla. Luckily it's very forgettable.",2
"Wednesday 2022 is an unoriginal combination of Harry Potter, Gossip Girl, That's So Raven, Twilight, Veronica Mars, with the characters from The Addams Family but only the characters, not the family. It uses the Tim Burton label for marketing purpose with only 4 episodes directed by him. It checks its production checklist but failed at telling a good story.My problems with the series (spoilers):It undermined the weirdness of the Addams by having a school full of so called weirdness which made it less weird. It's not the family against the world but rather the magical world against the normie world. But whatever, I can accept this setup, this is the least of my problems with the series.Nevermore is supposed to be a school for the outcast but it also chooses to outcast certain monster types, like the Hyde? It's just a magical school, not an outcast school, and you still have to fit in to be a part of it, which makes me think the creators of the series doesn't really know what it's like to be an outcast/misfit.Why would the villain go through all the troubles to try and resurrect a normie? Crackstone was evil but he had no real powers, he just hate magical beings, without his followers what can he do? But then he's resurrected and suddenly he had a magical staff out of nowhere and became a powerful sorcerer? And if you need magical power to destroy the magical school, then your hate has no base. It's just a silly plot device. The villain could have had those killings to drive a wedge between the normie and Nevermore and seed the hate between them and have some real damages.You have Ricci, the original Wednesday, should have made her a permanent role to side along with the new Wednesday, instead of making her a poorly written villain that barely had any screen time and only lasted a season. What a waste.The series is not too bad, Ortega gave perfect performance, the colors and cinematography are great, but the series is just not that good. Too many people seems to like it and giving it too high of an appraisal that it just doesn't deserve. I have no intention to pretend to be a film critic, but I'm a film lover and a fan of The Addams Family, so I give my opinion.",6
"Wednesday is so good , cute , warm, pleasant series that I have watched recently. It is combination of movies and series that I watched and liked. I think it is really similar with with Harry Potter. Like Harry Potter in Wednesday has magical school, 4 houses , competition like triwizard tournament , friendship ant etc. I wish they should show school life , vampires ,sirens , wolves more.Netflix should give more budget for this series. Because visual effects at some point was not so quality. But places, set , general ambiance which is created by G. O. A. T Tim Burton can changed eveeything in a good way and you even dont pay attention to the effects.Jenna Ortega was iconic as Wednesday. She is such an great actress and has real potential. She was born to play Wednesday.Christina Ricci who played Wednesday in the film in 1991 plays Miss Thornhill in this series. I was surprised when I heard. Even an episade where she said to Wednessay ""we are similar to each other and have something in common"" was subtle detail and she also played perfectly.Screenwriters wrote lines splendidly. Of course there is Tim Burton factor. We need to appreciate screenwriters who write scripts, lines , character so perfectly. Jokes are so much funny ,humorous, laughable and lines that given us in the sentences which showed how family is unique , extraordinary and maniac was perfect.If you like Harry Potter , Stranger things , Chilling adventure of Sabrina , Fear Street
You are going to love it.",10
"Netflix has a documented history of butchering characters from other sources. I give Tim Burton credit for not doing that here. I was not expecting a murder/mystery series but this worked well. The writers left very few clues so that you don't know for sure who the villain(a) is until closer to the end. I personally prefer there to be Easter eggs pointing to who that is but this leaves it open to be anybody.Regarding Jenna Ortega, I think she did an amazing job. Considering she is 20 and portraying a 16 year old, she brings a lot of experience and skill to the role. At the same time, it also makes you appreciate how well Ricci did in the 1991 movie. She was only 11 and did a remarkable job and still portrayed some innocence.Ortega does a great job showing teenage angst and rebellion against their parents, like so many teens do. Understanding the two are portraying the same character but at possibly different ages, allows one to believe in a continuance of the character; like the series The Crown.",9
"This is a very well done show with great acting and perfectly morbid undertones. Ortega nails it as Wednesday from start to finish and really carries the show... brilliant, talented and dark! The sutures on Thing's hand were a nice touch, and it was good to see a few of the other characters get an introduction, including Lurch and Fester. No Itt or Grandmama yet, but most at least had an appearance.The only real gripe I have is the casting of Gomez. Gomez is supposed to be a sword fighting, lion wrestling, non-stop energy force of nature, and they cast a morbidly obese actor for the role. He's a fine actor but just all wrong for Gomez Addams. He's only in a couple scenes in a couple episodes, so it doesn't really matter, but that was a huge miss. Pugsley and Morticia were perfect though, and Fester was fine.Other than that, it's fantastic... I hope they pull an Emily in Paris and just announce a multiple season extension on this gem while the actors are still the right age... 3 more seasons would be amazing. Highly recommend!!",10
"Season One: 8/10Themes: Paranormal, Mystery, Romance, Crime Solving, Comedy, Outcasts, Anti-Social Behaviour, Monsters, Dark, Serial Killer, Family, Love Triangle, Friendship, Gothic & High School.Review: This was surprisingly fun with a hint of darkness. The main character has an interesting and macabre personality, which results in an engaging mix of strange things she does and says. Seeing her interact with other people is often humorous, and a lot of her relationships managed to capture my interest. The plot was also pretty well-developed, albeit slightly repetitive. Overall, I thought this was a good show with a nice vibe and some decent acting (especially the main actress portrayed her role well).Top five characters: 1) Wednesday Addams, 2) Thing, 3) Xavier Thorpe, 4) Enid Sinclair and 5) Larissa Weems.",8
"OMG this snippet tv show of the Addams Family movies is spot on and awesomely captivating. The young lady playing Wednesday did her thang and gave the Addams most beloved vindictive character the best portrayal yet.I laughed. I cried. I was in shock over the twists. Definitely rate this a Must Watch. Excited about the next showing (hopefully soon)!I also loved Catherine Zeta-Jones portrayal of Morticia. Disappointed about Gomez and Uncle Fester's actors. But hopefully they will get better as the show progresses.Hit for Gomez actor: Kiss Morticia rapidly and passionately from fingertips to shoulder and back again ;) ijsFor Uncle Fester actor: Be more suspiciously adorable.Ohhh btw you won't recognize Christina Ricci. I didn't until my oldest daughter told me which character she played ;0 No Spoiler. You just gonna have to watch the show, see and fall in love with this new versions of The Addams family teen daughter for yourselves. ;)",10
"First let me just say, I'm a huge Addams fan! So when I heard about Wednesday I was beyond apprehensive to say the least. But with Tim Burton being apart of the first season I had some hope. (Also a Tim Burton Fan) Within the first few minutes I knew this show was going to be great! Jenna Ortega is the perfect Wednesday. The script is phenomenal and is not cheesy. The show is not overly gory but definitely takes a lot of suspenseful twists and turns which leaves you wanting more. I also love that they cast Christina Ricci the OG Wednesday as Marilyn Thornhill. Overall each character had a decent storyline where enough information is given without being too complex and muddying the story. I can not wait for Season 2! Netflix don't let me down!!",10
"Jenna Ortega is amazing as Wednesday Addams. She plays the role in a morbid and cynical way that is perfect for the character. She is also wonderfully twisted and sadistic. The story takes place at Nevermore Academy which is like a dark Hogwarts. There are werewolves, Sirens, Gorgons and more outcasts of society. Wednesday fits right in with this bunch of misfits. Gwendoline Christie does a fantastic job as the cheery principal. I love Catherine Zeta Jones as Morticia. Thing is great and cute in his own eerie way. I also like that Christina Ricci, who played Wednesday in the movies, is in this show as well. Great show that is creepy and fun at the same time.EDIT: The finale was the biggest ripoff of Harry Potter I've ever seen and it shouldn't have been.",8
Let's start with this is not the Addams family movie from the 90's very much different take. Im glad Tim burton is back to bring his style for this series. The actress that play Wednesday Jenny Ortega fits the character very well but I don't care for the back and forth with her character the moments when she's trying to do the right thing and call the police and stand for what's right idk just doesn't feel like the true Wednesday character it bothered me the whole series maybe I'm still holding on to Christina Rocco version. I do like the other characters like Enid she felt felt like a Luna love good type similar from Harry Potter not exactly but Enid and the other characters were fine. The plot of the monster and who it is they dragged out longer than they should've I felt like they could've done that with in 1-3 episodes and then developed it more into something else this had a scooby doo vibe here. I do like everything else about the show just these thing's kept sticking out for me.,7
"I found the show charming and entertaining but that's about it. Wednesday excels at everything. I understand child protégés which usually applies to 1-3 subjects but not Wednesday she excels at every single thing she encounters in the show. It becomes less worrisome for her character's survival when she's basically perfect and unbeatable. She's never challenged, always gets the last word, and can beat up groups of boys double her size without changing her facial expression. I'm pretty sure she is the next avenger. The other characters are pretty good. I like her roommate well enough. Sir Brienne of Tarth is great in her role as the headmistress.",4
"Let me start off by saying, I've been a huge fan of Addams Familys since the black & white TV. The first DVD I ever bought was the Addams Family live action movies. While not all Addams Familys projects were a hit for me (especially the CGI movies). Wednesday is a HIT!I wasn't sure what to expect when it started. Especially after I didnt hear the double snap in the intro, I almost felt like it wasnt going to be for me. It felt like it was going to be another ""weird family trying to fit in"" story at the very beginning, I was even thrown off by a 'thats so raven'-esque moment in the first 10 minutes. But it quickly transitioned to a COMPLETELY different type of show which can be best described as ""Nancy Drew"" meets ""Hogwarts"" meets ""Monsters High School"". While that sounds atrocious, with Tim Burton at the helm, it worked out great.They took what was probably the most popular Addams Character since the early 90's movie, and made an entire story about her growing into her own. No longer is Wednesday a 10 year old girl, but a young woman.The story itself starts off as a subtle 'who dunn it' mystery plot, but once it picks it does get very interesting. As someone who normally figures out the plot before reaching the end, this one definitely had enough twist and turns to keep us guessing until the very end.Where I do feel baited and switched is the case that they got a lot of high profile talent for this show, only for all of them to play very small parts. Luiz Guzman and Catherine Zeta Jones feel like they make brief appearances, I wouldnt even be surprised if they arent in a second season (fingers crossed there is another season). It definitely feels like the rest of the Addams family (outside of Thing) was underused. But the show is called Wednesday, so this should be expected.At the end of the day, I didnt know what to expect, but was definitely intrigues by the world the built, and enamored by Wednesday Addams herself. I thought this might end up as a tween-age highschool drama, which there were moments of that, but it definitely had Veronica Mars type deep mysteries that kept you guessing to the very end. There are times when you feel sad for Wednesday to the point of almost tears. With Tim Burton and Danny Elfmans added touch, this show is a winner.",9
I grew up watching 90's Addams Family Films and am a big fan of Christina Ricci's impersonation. When I first saw the remake adds I did not have high expectations at all but decided to give it a chance anyway on a Sunday afternoon since everyone in my household is sick and omg we finished the whole season 1 in one sitting. My husband enjoyed it and my kids too. I was delighted to see Christina Ricci in the series as well. The only critic would be CZJ as Morticia. I would like to see her really dive in and deliver as Morticia I don't feel she has yet.Favorite scenes were Wednesday's cello performance and dance!!! Jenna Ortega is fantastic!!!Can't wait for Season 2!!!,10
"My first 10-star review for a long time:) Exceptional adaptation, no empty characters. Very specific atmosphere - dark and noir, but not depressive, well done combination of humor and darkness. Cheerfully gothic - if this is possible :)All together - music, plot, dialogues, logic and characters - so wonderfully mixed. Single episode feels like a big music video.The only issue I had is The Monster. There is something so comedic in the face and those huge popped out eyes, that is it hard to take it seriously. Illustration to the ""What happens when pug goes nuts"" :)Hopefully there will be season 2, can't wait!",10
"Creepy, kooky, mysterious and spooky, and I'm usually first in line for ooky....however, THIS is not that, nor what I expected. I was first kind of shocked this historically family-oriented show was bloody and violent. Then it got kinda monotonous and a bit boring. Yes, I made it through the whole series....while cleaning house, folding clothes, cooking and pestering my dogs. That said, I must confess, I'm an intense watcher of good stuff, sometimes watching things over and over, never missing a thing, and discovering more each viewing...like Joker, Scarface, Silence of the Lambs. But once is enough watching Wednesday. I too, was a bit disappointed in how Gomez was cast with Luis Guzman. I enjoy his work, but cast here, was a chemistry mismatch for Zeta-Jones. Jenna Ortega, cast as Wednesday, can certainly hold her own and I think is an up and coming, attractive and talented actress. I would be compelled to watch her in something else. Regarding Uncle Fester, I heard him before I saw him and thought surely, it was Steve Buscemi. Nope. Fred Armisen. As for Wednesday, shame on her for belittling and bullying Thing, whom she counted on a lot.",6
"If you're going to change characters to this degree, make new characters. I don't understand the drastic changes to well-established and beloved characters we've been seeing in Hollywood for some time now. There's nothing wrong with taking inspiration, but taking liberties such as the ones seen in this show is, in my opinion as a huge fan of the Addams family, completely unacceptable. I don't see how any fan of the Addams' could enjoy it unless you completely separate it from every other version as though it existed in some alternate universe. As much as I hope Hollywood will get the message, I'm not optimistic.",1
"Well Christmas is just around the corner and to get the happy, nostalgic, old time feeling ( for the grown up kids) this is the series.I was just glued to it and only complain I had was why only 8 episodes? Well I know that is why it is this good..duh. But still
The storyline? Awesome
The acting of each one? Out of the world
The suspense?? Wow
Acting of these kids were so good I wonder what impact they will have when they grow up?This is kind of series one can sit together with whole family with some munchies and hot cocoa in a cold winter day and enjoy.I guess if you watch it now you will again want to watch it once you run out of feel good series again.",9
"I'm a 40 year old man, but I still found this extremely entertaining, I can't wait for another series. Addams Family does Harry Potter, but funnier! The family finally get the Tim Burton treatment and it doesn't miss a beat. Danny Elfman also contributes the perfect soundtrack, not that I expected any less. This brought back childhood memories, whilst feeling totally appropriate for the time. And extra special shout-out for Jenna Ortega - although Wednesday has never been this old, she was absolutely spot on.I don't want to include any spoilers in this review, but I really hope some of the characters that didn't make it to the end somehow return, this is my only complaint.",10
"I love all things dark. I like horror, Addams Family, Tim Burton movies. Naturally i couldn't wait for this series to come out and i almost wept with joy because it was so good. It was enticing, exciting, hilarious and so well done. The music was great, camera work, outfits. Tim Burton manages to bring his dark vision to life once again. All of this cast was amazing. They managed to give Wednesday and her Family a new spin, without loosing the kooky, spookiness of them. I couldn't tell the end of this murder mystery, until the very end. Escapism at it's best. I will forever rewatch. I truly hope Netflix renews the series for a second season.",10
"I'm not familiar with the original version of the Addams Family, but I was hoping to see something interesting from the once intriguing Tim Burton. I gave up in frustration at the end of the fourth episode. Oh yes, Burton really seems to have lost his mojo at this point, at least in my opinion. Jenna Ortega is really good and plays the character well, but everything else is mediocre to be kind. A few interesting sections (Wednesday playing the violin on the roof, the dance scene, and a few quotes) are not enough to make passable a series that mixes the most boorish teen drama with the most generic detective slash monster story possible. Too bad indeed.",5
"From Director Tim Burton comes a new Netflix series ""Wednesday"".Something old - ""The Addams Family"" - presented in a very new way!Think ""The Addams Family"" meets ""Supernatural"" meets ""Harry PotteR"" Hogwarts school.My Logline; ""Wednesday Adams, daughter of Gomez and Morticia Addams, finds herself an outcast in a school of outcasts at Nevermore School, her parents alma matter. Experiencing visions and a violent murder, Wednesday soon finds herself investigating a monster in the nearby woods and a school hiding many secrets.""I thought this might be a series for young teens but soon found it intriguing and oddly compelling. All the family members from the Addams family are here, with Katherine Zeta-Jones playing Morticia, Luis Guzman playing Gomez, and that wonderful actress Gwendoline Christie (of ""Game of Thrones"" fame) playing a shape-shifting school principal.There are strong echoes of ""Supernatural"", especially in the Harvest Festival scene, and of Hogwarts school in the Botany Class scene in this series.This is a wonderfully written, spectacularly cast, well-acted, and beautifully filmed series, which can be enjoyed by young and older adults.",9
"I likes this a lot. It's like other reviews say; it's a bit of a teenage movie with a bit of Addams family.. sure there are plot holes, sure there are 'convenient truths' to some thing, but on the whole it was humorous, entertaining and made me want more episodes.. and that's all a series needs to do.. looks good, nice music score and enough fun to be entertaining without losing a story in line with the Addams story. They missed a bit from my view on Gomez, but other than that I can't wait for season two to come around for, if nothing else, a few entertaining hours of content. It was good enough for me to write a review, that makes it one to remember..",8
"I feel like the series got a very good start and they manage to capture the audience attention through the trailer and how it tell the story. Another good point the crew make is that the way how they introduce the world and character. However , I feel like it would be better to make a full horror movie than this kind because I feel like it got both genre that fit for 13+ and horror which make the movie is like you know what I mean. Moreover, i feel like they are too ambitious with the character since they got more character than they need and some of them got more time than the other and some character can just be remove without big impact on the plot. Nevertheless, the audio is so good and like I said before since it a Tim Burton movie, it got a interesting way to tell the story. Last but not least, I have to give credit to the actor since they did a outstanding performance but the visual effect is like so bad and I find it ridiculously bad which is the main reason I only give it a 7 when it deserve a 8.",7
This is one of if not the best new shows in a couple of years. Jenna is so awesome and adorable as Wednesday Addams. She is an incredible actress she manages to play both emotionless and vulnerable at the same time. Watch this show. You will love it. Tim Burton did a great job. The whole cast was great. Gwendoline Christie is so different in this this then Game of Thrones. Fantastic in both. Can't wait for season two. Don't screw this up Netflix. Fun for the whole family. Jenna is so good at delivering those lines. I know people are bashing Juan Guzman as Gomez however he was excellent. Creepy and Cooky. Catherine Zeta Jones was gorgeous sexy and Morticia completely.,10
"Netflix is synonymous with producing some over rated rubbish. Wednesday though it's simply the best series I have seen on the Netflix platform or that on a whole.I absolutely loved Jenna Otega's portrayal of Wednesday Addams she is a fine actress whom I'm sure we haven't seen the end off.The series had a predictable ending but that aside, it was so magical, dark and brought out a softer side of Wednesday yet keeping that cold, emotionless character that Christina Ricci developed in the two films in the 90's.Bringing Ricci into the series didn't undervalue it, nor was it necessary to add value to it, the acting alone from the principal characters made it a worthwhile, enjoyable watch.Let's hope there is a series 2.",10
"Wednesday is a show about... well Wednesday. Christina Ricci stole our hearts as Wednesday Addams in The Addams Family and The Addams Family Values as its sequel so it comes to no surprise the franchise is brought back. The children of the Addams Family had a lot of screen time in the original movies so we are quite used to their perspective.In this series Wednesday joins a school for ""outcasts"" or more specifically for people with special abilities. Think Vampires, Werewolves, Sirines. The usual fantasy trope types resurface here. The show reminded me a lot of Harry Potter. It's a school setting with magical beings and magical things. It's obviously not as good as Harry Potter, but it kind of felt similar to me.You cannot watch this show and not try to make a comparison with Christina Ricci's Wednesday. And although Jenna Ortega tries her best I don't think there's anyone on this planet that can beat Christina. Her character superficially seems similar, but Jenna displays a more emotional version where instead of mischief we get anger and instead of cold stares we get anger and instead of a slight hint of superiority we get anger. Wednesday seems very angry at everything for some reason and it doesn't really help. Only sometimes do we see hints of the real Wednesday, such as the statue and Cello scene. Or the Piranhas scene at the start of the first episode.The men, as per the usual in Hollywood pictures nowadays where women take a lead role are all very weak losers that cannot do anything right. Pugsley her brother needs constant saving because he can't do anything himself. The original was never very smart, but he definitely wasn't a wussy. Her father turned into a short, ugly and obese waste of space instead of the ""zorro""-esque lover boy from the movies. The two appointed boys thrown in for Wednesday to be attracted to are both annoying and weak. On top of it all Wednesday painfully misuses the terms patriarchy, mansplaining and gaslighting when she doesn't get her way. It's all put in to make her appear independent and strong, while in reality it makes her play the victim. It doesn't suit Wednesday at all. But Hollywood cannot make a show with a female lead without complaining about men or how they are suppressed (even if those things are wrong or irrelevant).Storywise what's weird is that Wednesday seems very sure of her ventures and in an effort to get her way turns everyone against her and seems confused (and angry) as to why this happens. Also it's fairly easy to derive what's going on from a viewers perspective and by episode 2 you should have a firm idea of what's going on and who did what. It's all very very obvious. Yet you'll have to sit through 6 more episodes of Wednesday fumbling in the dark before she gets it. For how smart Wednesday is supposed to be she does come of very painfully stupid in this show. Which is a good thing maybe for her character development? It otherwise feels like a mismatch for her character. The original Wednesday Addams had plenty of character flaws already.The true star of the show is Thing. The hand that does it all. Has the best character, the best interactions. I think a series without Thing would be very mundane for sure. A honorary mention to Emma Myers as Enid who, with her colorful appearance and character, makes for a very interesting contrast to Wednesday. And while her character arc is very predictable it is very enjoyable to watch. Both Enid and Thing really sell the show and pushes it to be above average.All in all, it's a flawed series, but with a good budget and an entertaining story. Is it as good as the original? Well yes and no. Jenna will never beat Christina, which is fine, but it is very entertaining and perhaps even more so than the original. Jenna's version is likable dispite the flaws the writers pointlesly added to her character. Still, Wednesday in an indian outfit torturing another girl while slightly mischieviously smirking is how I will remember Wednesday at her best.",7
"The actress portraying Wednesday is the saving grace. Production quality seems good enough, with some good contrast between Wednesday and other color palettes. Otherwise, it's a tween drama masquerading as an Addams Family story. The story could have been better with a little less predictability and the unnecessary modern-revisionist pilgrim history that was shoehorned in. It was a weird attempt to walk the narrow line of not offending most of the audience while still appeasing the self-righteous Hollywood powers-that-be. The reviews comparing this to bad CW shows are spot on, but I did want to at least finish the series. The 12-17 y/o minds may be the targeted demographic. If so, this will probably succeed.",5
"The imagination of Tim Burton is out of this world. I laughed a lot, I was entertained a lot, and on top of this there are witty dialogs and quite a decent plot. The acting is top, and I could watch Jenna Ortega's look of disdain for hours :_D. There's a couple of moments in the show that I've watched dozens of times just to come to the conclusion that Tim Burton is a genius. One is when Enid is raging because her date and scratches the van (chapter 3 I think) ant the other one is in the chapter 7 when WD says ""Im not a very good GF, I will ignore you, break your heart and put my interests always on top"". Brilliant.",10
"OK, I quite enjoyed the 90s Adam's family movies, and I also really enjoyed the newer animated movies. Wednesday totally envolopes everything I love about Addams family, and does a great job amplifying my favorite character, Wednesday.First of all, the plot/story of the show. It moves really fast (bingeable), it grips you right from the beginning and keeps you engaged throughout the series. Never a dull moment. You start wondering how things relate to each other, and then it makes sense.Next is the acting. Jenna nailed Wednesday. The perfect tone of voice, facial expressions, etc. Very confident and matter of fact. The supporting actors and actresses were also fantastic.10/10 would recommend. Super fun.",10
"Overall it's a good concept but I don't like the idea of Wednesday having visions. It just feels like she's cheating. But I guess if the other kids are werewolves and gorgons, she needs some type of power.And Wednesday is a tad too nice for my taste. I was expecting a little less empathy and more comedic retorts. Maybe season 2 will steer in this direction.Most of the actors are good, especially Jenna Ortega, but Luis Guzman, Catherine Zeta Jones and the kid playing Pugsly are just terrible. Catherine is at least tolerable but Luis Guzman only knows how to play one and only one type of character and that's exactly what he does here.",6
"This currently is sitting at 8.5. That's being generous. It's not terrible but it gave me a gothic Nancy Drew attends Hogwarts meets Pumpkinhead on the CW type of vibe. It's shot nicely and you can definitely feel Tim Burton's influence, which is a good thing, and she portrayed Wednesday pretty well but I didn't think CZJ and LG where a very good Mortica and Gomez. Like how Thing was a primary character. I was pleasantly surprised how much blood/violence was in it which added an extra star.It did sort of drag a little but overall I found it to be passable and worth a watch. I'd probably watch a second season/entry but wouldn't be disappointed if they choose not to do one.7/10.",7
"Everyone is talking about Ortega (Wednesday Adams) and Tim Burton and sure, they deserve a lot of the credit but the truth is, the script is really well-written and the lines and storyline unravel flawless.It's pure entertainment, but don't let that stop you.The bleak view of Wednesday is just the perfect cynical voice of 2023, seeing right through the superficiality and advertisement of mediocre experiences.I loved her lines.I also greatly appreciated her delivery, quite perfect for such a young actress. Hands down to her.All the actors here played their part so well, including Gwendoline Christie (principal Weems), who has shown her true colors recently in another big part as Lucifer in The Sandman. Love her talent.Tim Burton strikes again, but I didn't expect anything less from him, this is truly right up his alley and he makes the most of it.What I noticed is that he kept his unique style while also laying down fresh, small directing details that are very much 'in' right now.He combines the old and familiar with the new in a way that's exciting and completely absorbing.I liked that even if it's probably targeted at the younger generations it's still a fun watch for adults as well. It kept me on my toes from start to finish, couldn't stop watching it.No unnecessary additions just to keep with the times, plain and simple morbid quirks in a fun, engaging atmosphere of contrasting characters and mysterious plots.I gave this an 8 because of the level of depth, but for a program of this type, it's as good as it gets!Give it one episode and you'll be hooked.",8
"I was not thinking I would enjoy this! I never liked Addams family as a kid. Never really enjoyed it. Always creeped me out. But this! THIS WAS AMAZING!!! It had a splash of romance, the twisted dark humor, and reality teen drama! Watched it over thanksgiving break and even saw someone at my school watching it next to me! I really fought the urge to blurt out, ""OMG YOU'RE WATCHING IT TOO!"" But yes overall, amazing! Can not wait to see what happens next! So many openings for another season and it would be a shame to let this go to waist. It has so much incredible potential! Dying.... (pun most definitely intended) for a season two right now!!!",10
"I understand the show is about Wednesday but seriously she is so hard to get to like... she's mean and annoying and selfish.What were they thinking with casting of Gomez? Ewwwww he has ruined the Addams family for me, he is just a poor poor choice with his hideous coloured front tooth lol why would Morticia want to be anywhere near thatThe show wasn't half bad, some actors were stiff and boring; like Tyler? The casting of uncle fester was also a weird choice, it could have been so much better but they made Wednesday into a character that was really hard to sympathise with, good shows get you enjoying the characters flaws and watching their growth, this show failed that miserably.",4
"This show was surprisingly good, and something easy to binge watch, but after episode two the political bias was incredibly clear. I was looking forward to a good show, were I did not have to listen to things that should be kept on twitter, in court, etc. Keep it out of children's TV. The first half was provided, and this is a generally enjoyable, and good TV show with plot twists and surprises to keep one on their toes. Wednesday is portrayed well, and the actors are convincing. I recommend it, yet it is frustrating to see political topics, that belong on the news, social media, or court in a children's TV show.",7
"Pretty bad acting by all other than the lead. Reminiscent of teen angers' first high school play The story line is mediocre. Bad writing. They take the Christina Ricci version of Wednesday and turn it up to 11. This is not a compliment. It is very forced. The creation of an Addams family universe has resulted in lore that borrows too heavily from Harry Potter. I cannot believe Tim Burton is attached to this. It is uncharacteristically bad for him.Production and effects are good enough. Just a notch better than a CW production. I understand people like this. It really does not speak to me. I am a fan of the original television series. I thought the movie adaptations were decent, but not great. That is where I am coming from.Edit: I've upped it from a 4 to a 6. It got better as the series went along. The teen actors seemed to find their hooves a bit, and the story line picked up. Still has many flaws, IMO.",6
"If you told me a decade ago that Tim Burton would direct an Addams family reboot and that it would be so mundane, I wouldnt have believed you. Yet here we areLook, the cast here is pretty good and the acting is about the same as you might expect in a teen drama, though each member of the Addams family does a good job.But there isn't much else here to praise.The pilot it far too long, resulting in a fairly boring episode of TV. It's lacking in any sort of tension, which is a key ingredient of both horror and comedy, the two genres this is working to fit in.Visually it's broadly uninspired. A few neat choices but most of the set design, costume design, lighting, and cinematography is undistinguishable from any other teen drama.The characters and their relationships are much in the same vein as everything else. Wednesday herself feels very edgy for the sake of edgy, lacking in any clear motivation for her actions and feelings once the real meat of the episode starts. This is fine for her as part of a broader ensemble, but not as the lead in a showNotably, on all of these issues, the show is inferior to the very similar ""Sabrina"" show on Netflix.The show, especially with Burton directing, feels like it would have excelled with a more satiracle or post modern type approach, like the one he brought to much of his work in the 90s and 00s.The pilot does not provide a compelling argument to keep watching. If I do and it improves, I'll update the rating.",4
"WednesdayThis is my first foray into the universe of The Addams Family, and I am pleased. The cinematography, styling, editing and costume is vibrant and rich. The soundtrack is also noteworthy.Jenna Ortega has proven to be one of the best acting stars of her age, delivering a charismatic and finely detailed, yet deadpan performance as Wednesday Addams. It's a certainty that she was born to play this role.Even though the movie is centred on Wednesday Addams, she has a bunch of interesting supporting characters. From the brilliant acting of Gwendoline Christine as Principal Larissa, to that of Catherine Zeta Jones as Morticia Addams, to the nuanced hand acting from Victor Dorobantu as The Thing, and finally the well juxtaposed Character of Enid played by Emma Myers. The other cast members I don't mention wouldn't be because of a lack in their performance, but to make this review concise.Netflix struck gold with this and I hope there isn't a dip in quality if further seasons are made.",9
"This show was so awesome and I can't wait for more seasons. The cast is perfect, the music is spot on, the plot and twists and turns were so good. I'm used to not being surprised because of the typical predictable show formula. This is not like that at all, thanks to the brilliant Tim Burton. Edge of your seat, never saw it coming suspence at the end. I will say that some of the deaths and villains were sad when revealed, I wanted those characters to stick around or not be a villian but oh well. The show is slightly comparable to Harry Potter, Legacies, Vampire Diaries somewhat, with a little bit of a romantic detective show thrown in, Like Beauty and the Beast. But those comparisons are small because this series is its own thing really. I really enjoyed it. I need more Wednesday NOW!",10
"Amazing. I was astounded how great of an actress she was throughout the whole series. It was shocking, questioning and kept me captivated the entire time. Delicious. It was weird at times talking about necrophilia...but other than that, top tier. Not sure I'm selling this, just watch an episode and you will understand. I watched the original series of the Addddddams Family about a year ago and it drove my wife nuts, but after knowing the back story it made this so much better. But then again ""Wednesday"" the actress crushed it. Just teasing whether or not there will be more episodes, please!!!!!That would be so rude, cruel, despicable and so 'Wednesday' to not have any follow up.",9
"I Loved the Concept of this Series .It was a Great experience. The series Catches me in such a way that i was conscious to know the name of the writer and to know about more series with such Concepts. Simply exceptional. I love the colourful and black and white mixed up Beautifuly. The thing that i loved the most was W Adams Savage replies to everyone and her nature of not disturbed by anyone's words,and the fade way in which the writer changes her nature was some out of the box stuff for me .The series was very family friendly and Was Very meaningful at the same time. So its the pick of the year 2022 for me.",10
"Wednesday is like an outcast Nancy Drew with a touch of darkness and a bit of ""Stranger Things"" thrown in.Wednesday is one of those rare shows that took me by surprise in an extremely good way. It (Wednesday) kept me intrigued and glued from the first episode to the last. It was hands down, the only TV show that I've binged watched this year. It's that captivating.The show while hardly original, is refreshing and unique from its point of view - a teenage Wednesday. The cast were well chosen (apart from IMO, Luis Guzman as Gomez Addams - Don't get me wrong, Luis is a great actor and I'm a fan, but as the suave and charming Gomez, Luis is not). Jenna Ortega did a superb job portraying the protagonist ""Wednesday"". Her acting is sublime. The other actors in the show did equally a brilliant job - kudos to the director (Tim Burton). And that dance. Yeah, the dance. You can't miss that part. I read Jenna choreographed it herself.Apart from the magnificent acting, the sets and directing were first rate. Tim Burton knocked another one out of the park. But I'm sure, it was made easy with Jenna Ortega in the main lead. Her take on Wednesday, took the character to a whole new level. She made Wednesday her own. Love it.VERDICT: Don't miss it. A must watch.",9
"I am a huge Tim burton fan and Addams family fan and this show did not disappoint! I have counted down the days until it's released and then binged it twice in less then a week! Jenna Ortega was a masterful Wednesday and I can't wait to see more!!!!!!!!!!! She took a one liner character and turned her into this intriguing teenage girl who was relatable while still being Wednesday. I loved how she was able to be true to who Wednesday Addams is but show character growth and her own bit of emotion. Time Burton took a world we all know and love and made it more current and relatable. He did his usual magic on the screen and I loved it! The cast was perfect and the storyline kept you guessing! I will be waiting impatiently
to hear season two news!!!!",10
"I almost didn't watch it when I saw who was portraying Morticia and Gomez. Zeta-Jones gave fat sloppy Morticia without an ounce of mystique and Guzman would have been more believable if he had play Uncle Fester in fact I thought the storyline concerning them was not needed at all; like someone cutting a puzzle piece to make something fit.I saw Tim Burton's name and I decided to take a ride and what a ride it was! This thing was GREAT! Wednesday Adams was a treasure, her deadpan was genious ( I'm 66 years old and I am looking forward to rocking Wednesday's wardrobe). The atmosphere, the witty and slick one-liners was on point! My favorite genre is who-done-it and this gem did not disappoint. With Tim Burton at the helm it gave excellent scares, believable characters, deft acting and this thing was paced beautifully. I was also happy to see Sir Lady Brienne of Tarth (Gwen Christie) featured in this thing.I binged the entire seies in one setting and never stopped for ??. It was just that kind of a roller coaster.Pretty Little Liars meets Riverdale meets Scream the series meets Wednesday!One final thing...I would like to see more Casting take in consideration the feelings of Black girls. The female police officer and the bald grease lipped Siren was not it. SMDH
Stop, its cruel to continue to cast the most unflattering Black girls in films. Stop.",8
"Absolutely adored every minute of it. It's got that trademark Tim Burton look, which is great because I think he's the perfect choice to direct a film about Wednesday Addams and her family. And It's impossible to overlook Danny Elfman's score; whenever he and Tim collaborate, the results are nothing short of perfect. However, perhaps because Tim only directed the first four episodes, I found the show's style and tone to be inconsistent throughout the rest of the eight episodes. The show did a good job with the character arcs, albeit there were some unnecessary elements, such as the uncle's minor role. I thought the acting was good, but not really outstanding. Overall, though, it was entertaining to me.",8
"One of the best Netflix shows of the year. The deadpan humor, the little bits of allusion to the Addam's family show (like the echo of the two snaps) and the actor that plays Wednesday Addams is dead on. All the characters are interesting. Everyone is a suspect. There is not a single episode that doesn't leave you with a thrill and you can't stop watching this creepy and spooky show. It's scary enough but not so scary that younger kids cannot watch it. There is violence and blood but much less than most video games. It also gives you a break from the spooky with loads of kooky. There's a little teenage romance, coming of age tales, and loyal friendships. All around, Tim Burton brings the dark spectacular to life.",10
"Wednesday... interesting seeing the incredible high feedback score for this series. Personally, I wanted to rate it higher, but ended up rating it a 5 out of 10. Why... well various reasons really. First of all, spotting Tim Burton and Danny Elfman already gives you goosebumps thinking back of Edward Scissorhands and Nightmare before Christmas, and although Wednesday as a series is nice and entertaining, it came nowhere near the other two movies mentioned here, and I'm actually being nice here. Secondly, the endless following of social agendas, especially thinking back of the original Addams Family, seems just so wrong. Not looking for a new Addams Family story, but one that stays true to the original, including the original music score and characters. Think only Uncle Fester came close to the character as portrayed in the original series. Thirdly, the story itself has embraced too many ""Harry Potter"" elements, which just made the whole show a bit sad and lacking the originality I'm used seeing produced by Tim Burton. Wednesday is just a female version of Harry, and nothing more than that really. Last but not least, found the storyline messy and extended to infinity for no reason whatsoever, other than trying to fill up eight episodes with the same-same over and over again, and am just not buying in to that, as quantity does not equal quality. That's why Big Fish will always remain one of the best movies ever made, it's exactly the right duration. Anyways, that's my feedback. So, although Wednesday is nice children's entertainment, it doesn't belong in my list of top productions. 5/10.",5
"WEDNESDAY is awesome, one of the best shows i have seen on Netflix!!!!! The acting of Jen O is so good, she is wonderful as Wednesday, her delivery of her lines is perfect! She alone makes Wednesday worth watching. Then there is Tim Burton, he has done a wonderful job of bringing this sbow to life, the mood, the camera work, the sets, is all deliciously wonderful. The supporting cast is also very good, i love Thing!!! Then there is the story, that has so many levels, Wednesday's life and conflict with her family, a new school, Wednesday and her visions, the creature killing in the forest, and what mysteries are going on at the school. Wonderfully yummy tv!",10
"Jenna Ortega as Wednesday is absolutely amazing, it feels like she was born for this character. She is by far one of my favorites actresses of this generation.The supportive cast is also really good, you feel for some of this characters ( my favourites in this show Enid and of course Thing).You don't need to know all about the Adams, just knowing a little bit about them is all you need, this show is all about Wednesday with of course small cameos from other members of the family.The big reveal at the end felt a little bit predictable for me, but the conclusion is really well executed.Overall I think people should give this show a chance, I promise you is an amazing ride.",9
"I had been waiting a few months for this show to be released, and I was not disappointed. I found the plot intriguing and some characters interesting. My only critique I have against this show is that some parts were so unnecessary. It felt as if they were trying to add so many different characters and events, but with the limited time they had, events felt so rushed, and characters so underdeveloped. Every episode a new kind of event thing happened: a ball, a race thing, a carnival, it felt so unnecessary. I feel like if they had focused more on like the school or some it would have been more interesting- like they built up the ball to be this big thing and it honestly kinda sucked, it definitely didn't live up to what every character was talking it up to be. The characters... where do I start? Wednesday was well written. I enjoyed her character, and she was so unintentionally funny. All the other characters felt so rushed though. They all had about one defining character trait and that's about all their personality was. The friends of enid's or whatever, I can't even remember them they were that irrelevant. So was Enid's boyfriend. Their whole love story felt so irrelevant again, felt like something the writers added in because- how dare anyone write about teenagers who don't have romantic lives! And Wednesday's love interests: again not needed. Love triangles are so overdone in film nowadays, it's just not interesting. Anyway, besides the millions unnecessary events that occurred and the underdeveloped characters who got into romantic relationships with little to no chemistry, I did enjoy the show, and I hope to see where it goes if it gets renewed for a season two- which it probably will, due to the attention it's receiving on social media.",6
"First of all, I get that this isn't an Addams Family story or Not defined in pre-established narrative. But regardless of that, the plot was just a typical cliché.Jenna Ortega was amazing in her role as Wednesday. She portrayed a character that was unapologetic, confident and unreserved.Wednesday Addams establishes herself as the no-nonsense girl that enjoys her independence and takes no concern over what other thinks. This quality is almost consistent throughout the series, however the plot and directing basically attempts at condemning this trait. Wednesday is basically forced to attend Nevermore Academy in order to make her more sociable. Proceeding to which she is roomed with Enid, a jubilant and colorful girl who makes a sincere effort to be friends with her. Enid's dynamic with Wednesday brings out a new dimension to friendship where both girls are able to accept each others quirks, the chemistry between them works pleasantly. From there on the rest of the plot just basically tries to weaken her character as a girl who is overconfident and insensitive to other peoples feeling. Wednesday is put in-between two male leads who only care of dating her and becomes eventually becomes theme of the plot. The series attempts to make a character like Wednesday to be helpless by herself and that only others can help her solve problems. The romance element the series attempts to inject is also very unnatural, where the two male leads are repeatedly thirsting to date Wednesday despite her overt attempts at rejecting them. But this eventually leads to her being worn down to like one of them. The plot hits every cliché plot device from framing the wrong suspect to making the other male lead the cliched villain all along. Although Wednesday keeps her dark gloomy stature, she is painted as a helpless girl that is better off with love. Wednesday initially started the series as a strong character only to have become conformed to the standards set by those around her.",6
"There is little to nothing in this show that hasn't already been done, with the only appeal being Jenna Ortega's faithful and enjoyable portrayal of Wednesday. The show just feels like the writers watched Euphoria or Monster High and wanted to try it out only with more cliches and a TERRIBLY forced love triangle and needed a recognisable IP and loved characters. They attempt to add depth to characters with their own family struggles but they ultimately don't go anywhere and most don't matter to the overarching story line. The treatment of Enid's character development particularly irks me as it is actually relevant in today's climate, despite being ham-fisted and completely lacking any nuance, and is only ruined for a cheap and quick fight. Enid's cheap fight is only bested by the embarrassingly short and bland climactic fight between Wednesday and a painfully boring resurrected Crackstone.In the end if you like The Addams Family and coming of age shows you'll at least find this enjoyable but it leaves a lot to be desired.",4
"Way too boring for the adult audience .The shift to teen drama may work for an audience that is coming into contact with the universe in question for the first time, but its execution does injustice to the rich legacy that cartoonist Charles Addams' creation has left us .The success of the Addams family was based on a clear logic. We may be weird, different, more macabre for your tastes, we may even seem like a broken family, which is impossible to fit into society, but the truth is that the real threat is the seemingly normal and ""normal"" people who surround us.With difficulty I managed to follow the whole series.I almost slept through all the episodes.",4
"Its about a school of freak and wednesday adams solves a mystery about a monster whos is killing normies and school kids you wanna stick up till find the end of the series best series it reminds me about hogwards but freaks one the monster name is hyde.i was worried it wouldn't be able to compete with the other versions of the addams family but WOW! This was amazing!Normally i don't do reviews but i'm just so blown away. From the casting to the acting to the set design to the plot and storyline, wednesday has completely left me speechless in the best way! I grew up watching the addams family movies and loving them for how weird and odd and endearing they were, this fits right in.",10
"If you are an Addams Family fan, don't watch this expecting that same family you know and love. This is simply put another in an endless line of established known titles used for an easy. Segway.. i cant even begin to. Emphasize how unfamiliar these Addams? Are from their original counterparts. Typical, rehashed modern day stale toast, served up just how they like it. Truly anyone who thinks this.is fantastic or anything above 5 stars must also think. Space Jam 2 was a cinematic coup. I really went into this with an open mind, praying the feeling i already had from the cast and previews was premature, but oh no. My spidey senses were right on the money. True This Addams Family doesnt have to be like any of the others, but at least carry on some sort of reminiscent feeling that made so many watch this in the first place. Watcher Beware. This is try hard central. Or look we dressed up as Addams for Halloween, arent we cool?",4
"Let's be honest, the Best Wednesday Addams was portrayed by Christina Ricci, the only features that Ortega succeeded in copying Ricci are Wednesday's Blade Sharp comments & Emotionless face.The Rest of the show is Like a bland recreation of Harry Potter's Hogwarts with all the riddles, quests and secrets Just themed by The Addams Family.The YouTube Girl made a better Series for Wednesday but was lacking the looks.Gomez Addams is more like a Cartoon Gomez Character than the ex movies and tv shows, I prefer Raul Julia's sleek and chic figure than this Gomez, and plz leave the wide waist circumference to Fester it suits him better.Pugsly here is a whimp, norm kid ..useless lump when I describe it like that it sounds right but it doesn't look right on the show.And what a pity choosing Catherine as Morticia, Cher would've made a better Morticia Addams.Lurch is ok kinda Frankenstein's monster look..but thing with all the stitches looks like Lurch's hand fell off...but not nad either.So it's like watching Harry potter but starring Wednesday Addams rather than Harry Potter.The best thing here in this show is that Ortega succeeded to be 55% Christina Ricci's WednesdaySad attempt but we like it, and Why!!!??Because we're the Addamses.",5
"Tim Burton and Crew have hit this one out of the park!Masters of the craft in this genre.It could have been a huge failure but they told the story as authentic yet fresh.The entire cast fit into this kooky world brilliantly, the new characters and world that was created for the show far surpasses any expectation that I had. The story tied in wonderfully and seamlessly to the Addams family world. Jenna Ortega was absolutely the perfect Wednesday .Each character had a reason to be there and even though they are not the main story you still want to get to know them too.Season 2 please!:D.",10
"I really am not sure if this has to be a comedy, mystery, horror, parody...? Once again Netflix try to profit from well succeeded movie ideas. Jenna Ortega did play Wednesday well, but everything else was just unbearable.Adaptation
Wednesday Addams would never dress herself as a e-girl tik tok style. She loves the classy dark gothic clothes. It is half half here. Sometimes she really looks like Wednesday's taste ,but sometimes not. Wednesday also doesn't really stay with neutral face the whole time. In old movies and cartoons if you'd like sometimes she does show some emotion no matter is it when she tries to be spooky or jokingly spooky or tired of crap. What is it with Gomez? I mean he really really doesn't look like him. Even tho this is about their daughter. There are no monsters in Addams movies,stories,scripts. So where did werewolves and vampires came from??Locations
Nevermore is basically Hogwarts. They have social groups that are really much accurate to the houses of Hogwarts. The style of the school. The spookiness, the fact that all the shots are taken night and with lightings and thunderbolts to make it spooky as with Hogwarts, i guess , where is the magic? Oh wait, Rowans sudden telekinesis. The room from which Rowan took the book at ep.2 (i think it was) is exactly like that one part from Harry Potter franchise movies where Harry found an empty room with a mirror and the mirror showed him his parents and etc.ClichesFighting scenes
Totally unrealistic with the exception of 1-2 moves out of 10.",2
"It's been a while since I last watched something that made me this angry. I don't understand why they decided to take an iconic character like Wednesday Addams and ruin it. This has nothing to do with the Addams Family. The main character is just a basic, moody teenager. The scene that shocked me the most was in the episode where that guy with glasses (I didn't even bother with names) tried to kill her and her face showed actual fear. Really?There are so many wrong things and it's all because they couldn't give this girl another name and decided to use a classic family as reference. I wouldn't have any problem watching this thinking it's just a mystery series with supernatural elements.Overall it's just a disappointment. So sad.",1
"I walked into this tv show thinking i would see a completly kids tv show like the movie (the addams family) but i was happy of how it came out to be more than that its more like an inbetween a normal tv show and an adult tv show also loved the way they portrayed the charachter of wednesday in a realistic way also not so realistic but good enough,also loved the way they show the environment in a subtle way that kinda gives you a sense of how the characters feelthe show has a nostalgic side that satisfy anyone that watched the old movie as a kid but in the same time a person who didnt watch the movie wont feel lost.",9
"It looks like it could just be any boring Netflix TV show. But when I tell you this is GOOD. I watched all 8 episodes back to back. I couldn't put it down. This show has a great mix of murder mystery, romance, drama, and horror. Wednesdays character was displayed perfectly. Everyone around her is colorful and witty and she is emotionless and dark. (So we thought) The ending really made me tear up when she hugged Enid. It ended when we just got to see Wednesday step out of her emotionless vibe. When she was just starting to create her own path at the Nevermore. The first season was just a touch on the surface of getting to know the characters and i hope we get a nice long season 2!",10
"Even Jenna Ortega (who Carrie's the show), Christina Ricci and Gwendoline Christie who exceed in their roles can't save this show.Where is Tim Burton?? Not in this show that's for sure!! Since when did Wednesday develop feelings?? She's iconic in her darkness and sarcasm which are lacking here.This is only a pathetic blend of Sabrina the teenage witch, Harry Potter and X-men that they decided to add ""the Addams Family"" in the mix and even the Addams Family is not present at all.Some will argue it's about the daughter. But I don't know who this Wednesday is because it's definitely not Wednesday ADAMS. Loved Christina Ricci's Wednesday and I'm sticking with that version and the original in black and white. This would have been pleasant if it had been called differently with other names for the characters as it is exactly that...same names for the old characters we love but with a much changed scenario, plot and overall lack of dark humor.I'd say it deserves a 4.5 but since there's no half stars I'll give it a 4.",4
"After watching the trailer I could tell something was off about the show. Not the typical Addams family dynamic. As other have mentioned, another angsty teenage sci-fi drama... I don't mind if they have a show centered around one character, but we're heavily missing the connection between the rest of the family. All of the characters are different. Good job on appearance, but the personalities don't match. Gomez seems a bit quiet and reserved when he's normally a showman. Morticia appeared to be too positive and hurt by Wednesdays pessimism and distance from her. Pugsly was just a little wimp that relied on his sister's affection. I love Fred Armisen but his Uncle Fester was horrible. Wednesday's (Jenna Ortega) performance was better than I thought it would be from first glance but still nowhere as stoic as it should be, but much more harsh and cynical to the point that shes an outcast in a school filled with outcasts and everyone she 'befriends', ends up hating her for the same reason they liked her, but have no problem with her by the end of the series. They still have some of their odd quirks but no one really seems fazed by them, or they quickly accept them as almost normal. The plot was quite predictable and the same thing you've seen time and again; new student shows up, mysterious things start to happen, dangerous monster, constant misdirect showing who you should think is the culprit when it's painfully obvious who it is (and isn't). Some of the deaths were unnecessary and quick to the point and the last episode seemed kind of rushed, could have used a couple more episodes to flesh out the resurrected Pilgrim ancestor, his random magical powers, and plot to kill outcasts, despite sort of being an 'outcast' now (undead and magical). The main baddie got a simple K. O. in the end, with no explanation what happened to them afterwards. The final scene obviously leaves off on a cliff hanger, opening it up to another season, after we see the 'monster' reappear. If you want to keep the same spirit of the first season, that's fine, but at least make new mysteries, dangers, monsters, and villains, don't rely on reoccurring characters.Overall, it was good for a laugh, some of the jokes were funny and on par with the Addams family, some of the characters were well done, I loved the interactions between Wednesday and her roomie. The camera work and symmetry as well as the wardrobe/makeup/set design, were all great. Other then that, it kind of fell flat, was kind of slow, boring, and as mentioned before, somewhat predictable. As a stand alone show, it's alright; as a continuation of the Addams Family Legacy, it was quite a poor representation, as it was more of a reimagining of the world The Addams Family lives in. Tried to write a spoiler free review but I think I went a little into too much detail ??",6
"Really enjoyed it. Was expecting a train wreck as the originals were so good. But nope, spot-on. Gomez was an odd casting choice but besides that nailed it with the rest. Wednesday was great and enjoyed her room mate personality split. Hopefully more of Wednesday being twisted in the next season. Good humour and love the finding of beauty in the dark and the gloomy. Like didn't quite get that the normies are aware of monsters? But not a drama. Good fun show well worth the watch. Should have killed the mayor's son and his mates tho. But maybe next season. Better than a lot of the other stuff Netflix puts out.",10
"Where do I even begin? It's so freaking awesome. The suspense that built after finishing episode made me so addicted that I couldn't stop watching it. It's a show that I would always watch it again. Truly awsome, The actors were right on spot and never made me feel bored. It's my new favorite show. Plus it's a show that was hard to predict what was going to happen next which is something that I truly like and makes the viewer stay hooked. Wasn't expecting all the twist and turns. Hope they make second season which I would definitely watch it based on this first season. The ending left me speechless and left more questions for me.",10
"Among all the other sludge that has been released on the movie and tv-show front over the past few years, Wednesday is definately refreshing.It's far from ""perfect"", with some strange character choices, repeating plot points, and somewhat plotholes, but overall I enjoyed it.I'm 36 years old now, so I'm probably not the intended demographic, but even for me it was quite decent.16 year old me would probably give this show a 9 or maybe even 10 rating.I don't know what else to write, need to fill up some more characters in order to post this. Almost there. Just a few more. There we go..now.",7
"This show mixes a lot of the elements from successful franchises like Harry Potter and Riverdale then backs it up with a lot of the original dark humor and lore from the Addams family. The result is a bit of a ""super powered teen soap opera murder mystery"" and, while this mix could easily flop, ""Wednesday"" totally makes it works.A big part of the success is due to Jenna Ortega's amazing performance. She's perfect as Wednesday but the supporting cast, especially Emma Myers, also deliver in their performances in a way that's campy, fun, but also heartfelt. The direction and production value are also solid. Totally a quality show.While I haven't finished the series yet, my only complaint would be this: I think there's some inconsistency between the Addam's family history / lore of diabolical behavior - indeed a lot of Wednesday's dark jokes infer terrible things her family has done in the past - and one of the main story arcs where a member of their family is accused of murder. Without giving anything away, the character's reaction to the accusation seemed way out of character to me. You'd expect the Addam's family would sort of laugh it off, or be like ""yup, that makes sense. Next."" but instead it seems to conjure up feelings of mistrust and betrayal, which just seemed odd considering there are plenty of other jokes where the family is kinda like ""oh yeah, our uncle is a cannibal"" and then nonchalantly moves on.This isn't a major criticism, and I'm still very much enjoying the show I just think it's weird that the whole family is a celebration of ""the dark side"" but then, in this one instance, they're like ""oh no, that would be bad behavior"". Lol, wut?",8
"I stopped watching after the fourth episode bcs I didn't get convinced by Wednesday's reason to stay at school and play Nancy Drew. Also, I really would like to see scenes from Wednesday's dark deeds as she describes them or just flashbacks, not just empty mentions as if they are gonna make us believe everything she says. If you wanna keep ppl watching then show them the stories. People are here to watch, not listen to tales. Some characters just don't fit the story. Especially Wednesday's roommate. I wish the whole series had been given to Tim Burton to write/direct. Corporate agendas are clearly showing themselves. Pity.",6
"It's like some random producer said ""love triangles are popular with the demographic we are aiming for"", and honestly, they would be right in thinking that, it's a great way to infuse foolish jealousy and petty drama into any situation. Hell, if I'm gonna be fully honest, I found myself shamelessly enjoying the absurd ""are you going to the dance with this guy? How could you?"" situation. Sure, it was ridiculous and completely unearned when it comes to setup, but it was fun and outrageous. Furthermore, it was quite unreasonable of either of the boys to expect a romantic relationship from her when she gave no indication of liking them at all. Honestly, they barely interact enough for any real feelings the boys could have to be believable. If they had actually put in some effort when writing the romance, it could have been intense and weird in the best way possible, but for that to happen, Wednesday would need to be a version of herself who's capable of putting herself out there for romantic love. She not only lacks the vulnerability required for satisfying romantic development, but she also seems to actively dislike the idea of romantic love. This is exactly what would make her the perfect asexual character, it proves that there is nothing wrong with not experiencing sexual or romantic feelings, you can still care about people and be a good person, but on your own terms. To me, there is nothing more Wednesday than to be yourself regardless of what people think you should be, so when they tried to push this onto her, it felt uncomfortable and wrong. This is still a great show with a pretty bad final villain and ending in general.",9
"The mostly excellent cast and crew are just that in their roles, costumes, set design, cinematography, editing, direction, effects, score, everything. It's just about two episodes too long though with story lines and subplots that do not need to be included. Especially for the supporting characters, who are great in their own performances, story lines, and character arcs with no need for the multiple back stories. That is minor compared to the outstanding performances of the leads the supporting characters. Even though they totally gave away the ending in the first episode and the twist was as predictable as the cliff hanger.",8
"I didn't see any trailers or reviews about this show, it was relatled to the Addams family and that was enough for me since I am a big fan and had seen them all.What I'm trying to say is I started to see Wednesday blindly without any expectations or whatsoever and God I am happy I did that.When I started the first episodes I was really impressed
The casting is absolutely amazing and the gory Addams atmosphere was totally there
That's was surprising to me until I saw that the Director is the brilliant Tim Burton who ,of course, master this gory grey atmosphere likewise Nightmare before Christmas, Corpse Bride and others.You can see Burton's fingerprints all over the show.Wednesday is really fits to the role
Plot is solid and very entertaining
The show get you hooked since the 1st episodes
Soundtracks are excellent;
Chopin,Metallica (nothing else matters)...
Also using Edgar Allah Poe in the plot was a great a nice touch and kinda a tribute to this brilliant author/poet
Overall this is excellent work and I watch all 8 episodes in one night.Kudos for the actors, actresses, writers and everyone who shared in this amazing piece of art.It's a solid 9/10.",9
"Everything is impeccable here: faithful costumes, good art directing, beautiful cinematography, great narrative and it's characters and mainly Jenna Ortega's delightful performance as the character-title, her acting is impressive and I think she's one the most talented actors today. But the fact they made a horrible CGI of the creatures disconnect me a couple of times when I was watching. I don't know if that was the idea, if they wanted to do some trash movie vibe or something, but if it had a Stranger Things level CGI this thing would be perfect. Netflix should definitely renew to Season 2 and invest way more in the visual effects! 9/10.",9
"Wow, just binge watched the whole season! It is one of those shows where you start to get sad that you're reaching the end of the episodes because you don't want it to end. This is hands down one of Netflix's best series, restoring some faith in the sea of mass produced mediocrity. This show is up there with Stranger Things and Queen's Gambit, my faves. Jenna Ortega is incredible as are the other actors in the show. The story line seems predictable in the beginning but there are lots of twists and turns keeping the watcher guessing til the very end. Excellent directing. Great story telling. I seriously hope they co tinge this series!!",10
"My dad would watch the original Addams Family when I was a kid, I do remember the unique mannerisms of each character and the cooky, spooky lifestyle they lived. I remember liking Munsters more, but both were enjoyable enough. However I was basically the prime demographic for the films and, like many others, yeah, I loved them. Never saw the CGI one.I went into Wednesday knowing pretty much nothing about it except it was a spinoff based on Wednesday and Christina Ricci was somewhere in it.Indeed, I was quite pleasantly surprised. Honestly, I enjoyed it quite a bit. I only have a few complaints, and most fall under the same umbrella...But they had a VERY high standard to live up to...and I'd say they did as good a job as anyone probably could have.One thing I recall about the previous Addams family iterations is they didn't necessarily relish in the fact they were so weird. They just...were. It was sort of their thing, how they were basically oblivious to how twisted and odd they were, and it was everyone else who commented on it. Wednesday doesn't really follow this, which I do find disappointing...to an extent. In its defense, from what we've seen, it does seem to be mostly Wednesday who almost takes pride in her oddities, and the rest of the family is ^^as above. Of course, we see barely anything of the family, so we'll just have to see where they go with it.However, if you 'are' going to make this change, I think Ortega and the writers did as good a job as you can. It's not like she made a HUGE deal out of her weirdness, but it was still a shift away from the traditional Wednesday.The other major complaint is similar to others here. At its core, Wednesday really is a teen drama, a la Degrassi. Definitely not as cheesy and teenie as Degrassi, the show absolutely is made to appeal to adults as well, but it's a similar structure where most of the episodes in some way revolve around teenage drama at school...namely boys and popularity contests, ""proving"" yourself etc. Fortunately there was still enough ""adult"" content that I could just roll my eyes and laugh to quickly get over some of the cheese, but it seems more like a show made for a mother/daughter than a general fan of Addams, Burton, or all things creepy.Having said that, I enjoyed it immensely. I loved the dry humor and wit Ortega delivered so perfectly. She is, obviously, the real star of the show. I'm a pretty 50/50 Armisen fan but I don't see how anyone couldn't like his Fester. Is it Christopher Lloyd? No. But so what? He still did a great job showing the demented quirkiness of Uncle Fester. Just because it's different or not as good doesn't mean it isn't good. Lloyd's version was actually much more of a shift away from OG Uncle Fester, so if you don't like Armisen, you can't claim that as being a reason.Same applies with the family members. I think the 90s films pretty much perfectly cast the Addams Family, so Netflix had a high bar to beat there, and instead of also going for the ""perfect"" look, they decided to roll the dice and go with the ""new"" look.For the most part, it works. It will be divisive, but I think over time we will continue to appreciate THIS Addams family more and more. I admit, I don't 'love' CZJ's Morticia, but I don't hate her either. I'm probably in the minority of that one though so, take it or leave it.They are also clearly trying to capitalize on the ever widening gap of Harry Potter content, so Nevermore and Wednesday's paranormal adventures are very reminiscent of the Harry Potter movies...if you liked those, you will almost certainly like Wednesday. Just imagine Hogwarts but slightly smaller and if Tim Burton designed it, and they frequently visit Hogsmeade.And on the note of Harry Potter there is also a magic/paranormal aspect to Wednesday, which at first I was a little iffy on, but I learned to appreciate what they were going for...which is exactly what they said. A unique spin off with the Wednesday character, not a re-creation of Wednesdays past.My advice? Don't look too far into it. Take Wednesday for what it is...a portrayal of everyone's favorite sociopathic anti-hero prodigy...and you are bound to enjoy it.8/10, really hope to see more of Armisen and Ortega in a season 2.",8
"I liked it until the script made Wednesday wear a dress that »will turn some heads«.When she threw on that catsuit two episodes before, I flinched. The dress nailed it.Sorry, but this will go unmatched.Wednesday is such a strong character. Surely there are ways for her to get what she wants without having to »turn heads« or »look beautiful«.Promising mystery though. If Wednesday can keep her independence, she would be a great mixture between Holmes and Poe. If, on the other hand, the script turns her into just another smokey eye hot goth girl, meh. Boring and so 80ies. Let her flourish and mete out punishment and torment like she ought to.",6
"Perfectly casted series and exudes the Tim Burton quirkiness his fans love him for! Jenna Ortega is superb as Wednesday! I love all of her black and white wardrobe. I absolutely love Wednesday's dance scene, too??. I read where she felt very insecure shooting that scene, however she nailed it! It was very reminiscent of Beetlejuice when they danced around the dinner table. Christina Ricci being casted is nice touch! I enjoyed this much more than I expected to. The Romanian actor whose hand plays ""Thing"" brilliantly makes you fall in love with his character. I was surprised to find out this show was filmed in Romania.",10
"This series was amazing. Jenna Ortega's Wednesday Addams is dark and wounded, yet Ortega manages to give her a compassion not normally associated with this character. I could watched her for a very, very long time. The supporting cast was excellent. Each character was much more complex than your usual characters which made for well-balanced viewing. I was really happy to see Percy Hyde White again. This cast includes some young talent I will keep an one on.I can't wait for another season to see how excellent a team Tim Burton assembles next. This series was very enjoyable. I hope Ortega's characterization of Wednesday shows growth in the coming season but retains the darkness we so love.",10
"As an 80's baby i grew up with the 90's movies absolutely loving it. I also was born early enough to even see the series from way before that. I loved the Addams family and offcourse as a girl, Wednesday was my favourite. Hearing Tim Burton was doing this serie had me stoked allready, but the man absolutely knocked it out of the park. The serie is new and fresh, but also has a lot of recognition for the older viewer. Morticia and Gomes are still disgustingly in love. With Gomes still kissing Morticia's arm, Thing is still the same just trying to be there for the family. And Wednesday is still her dark self.This show however gives a huge dept into the character Wednesday. That Christina Ricci plays a roll in it is just is the icing on the cake. Especially when she says to Wednesday that she is just like her. Its all that little details that just make this show. Apart obviously from the great fantasy Tim Burton made of this serie full of monsters, weerwolves and other beautiful creatures. The serie Wednesday is the perfect example of making something new, with the respect to the previous films and shows.It is mysterie, excitement, adventure and a lot of fun with just the right amount of dark humor.After seeing the first episode i was allready extremely excited for the rest, that did not change anything after finishing the show.",9
"I'm not an Addam's Family fan. I decided to check out this series due to Tim Burton's involvement, although Burton has had many more misses than hits of late. To my pleasant surprise, I would the first four episodes of the first season, which were all directed by Burton, to be extremely entertaining. Jenna Ortega's superb characterization makes an odd character very likable. That's the key to making this series work. However, to my disappointment, with episode five came Gough and Millar's trademark melodrama and over-the-top character angst. That killed this series for me. If you liked the melodrama of Smallville, you'll like this series as well. Personally, I would have preferred the series to have focussed primarily on Jenna Ortega's winning performance, rather than having it subverted into another one of Gough & Millar cookie-cutter teen soap operas.",6
"The trailer for this show did it no justice. I originally thought ""oh another Addams Family tv show who cares"". I could of never been so wrong. My oldest was watching it with her brother and I sat down to see what they were watching. By the end of the first episode I was rushing to find the remote to hit ""play next episode"". It felt and played out like a Sherlock Holmes movie but with Wednesday as Sherlock. It was well done for a teen show. Some of it was predictable; but did enough to make you second guess sometimes. I like some of the little Easter eggs hidden throughout the show. If you watched the original or remember the original them song you will like the little nods to it throughout the show. I hope there will be a season 2!!",9
"Meet the worst actress of 2022, Joy Sunday. Didn't like her character and those idiotic blue contact lenses have to go. Besides that, praise to Wednesday and the rest of the cast. The main character's outfits were beautiful and I wish more women dressed like her. Plus, Miss Ortega was incredibly funny in her role as Wednesday. Very creative series and each episode is a winner. Recommend. Remember, the original Adam's Family only last two seasons on television and became popular during constant reruns for the past 56 years. The Thing character almost steals the series from Wednesday, but she does an exceptional job. Recommend to all.",9
"First of all...PLEASE stop casting people who are close to THIRTY to play high school and college roles! Joy Sunday looks and sounds more like a teacher than a student. Long hair on guys and bangs can't cover up the true age of these actors.With that being said; I miss the humor the Addams Family truly brought us. This is like Wednesday Addams goes to Hogwarts. She was more fun as a morbid kid than one with some sort of power.Entertaining, yes, but nothing like the dark humor I grew up with. As a young kid, the original Addams Family taught how to think of the irony of what the characters were saying. I guess with Tim Burton's touch, I was expecting more.",6
"I was so stoked that Tim Burton would finally be directing a ""TV"" series and especially one based on the Addams Family's Wednesday, as I'm a HUGE fan of all of the above.Having the legendary director, a cast I like and the fact that this would be a Netflix original, (so as not to be limited in what they could do with this show,) it seemed the sky was the limit...Three episodes in and I am pretty disappointed. The writing is bland and the dialogue very rudimentary. I'm was expecting an intriguing plot with laughs, clever dialogue and even some frightening scenes and characters to boot. Alas, I have yet to see any of this unfold.I read a user review and thought this could be something dark, funny and twisted like the Chilling Adventures of Sabrina.... Instead, it has been more like the later, crappier seasons of a CW show, ala Riverdale, (which isn't my cup of tea.)I'm just bored with it so far and have little interest in starting the next episode when one ends.I will eventually pick it back up, because I love the Addams Family and Tim Burton. I'm really hoping that is gets better, because there is so much that can be done with the source material.I will say, the music by Danny Elfman is AMAZING!!!!!! The costumes are great and the sets are just fine. It's the WRITING and weak dialogue between the characters that have been a huge let down to me.Please, Please get creepy, kooky and spooky and just a little funny.",8
"Exiting, thrilling, dark, mysterious with the darkest of humor and NOT for younger audiences. WARNING SHOW IS VERY ADDICTING it's so good I'm stuck on it I'm late for everything because I'm watching this show it is the greatest show ever. Also very funny in a dark way there's no laughing in the show and you can't tell sarcasm from normal talking but all of this is in a good way. The mystery will keep you up all night and the drama is breathtaking. Definitely not a watch together show more of a watch alone every moment of your free time show it is addicting so recommended that you watch on a weekend when you have nothing to do. Overall 100/10 Incredible show!",10
"Thanks for this outstanding season, dark, gothic, each episode is beautiful. The film crew did a memorable job. We follow the episodes with greed, we want it to never stop, the scenario takes us into the madness of the gothic. The actress is perfect, she's gonna get an oscar because she plays so well. The casting is perfect, each young person plays his role, they are tormented, perverse, vicious, like all young people of this age because they build their personality. Each episode is truly a dark beauty diamond and honors to Jack Burton. This series is as beautiful as Andor, which will have an Oscar I don't know but we end the rotten year 2022 with fantastic TV programs, thanks to those who create, produce quality.",9
"I'm a huge fan of the old TV series and the movies are fantastic. Maybe I had my expectations too high, but I can't understand how anybody who has seen any of the previous incarnations of the Addams Family could rate this show highly. The only positive comment I have is that some of the special effects are not too bad; thus 2 stars, instead of 1. However, the negatives are many. First, the character of Gomez Addams is extremely awful, Mortica is boring, Pugsley is a non-entity, and they even manage to make Lurch and Thing uninteresting. The Wednesday character is easily the best of the bunch, but that's not saying much. And, true to the usual nauseating Netflix wokeness, all of the male characters are violent and/or dimwits.I barely made it through the first episode, and based on the previews, it looks like it'll turn into a lame ripoff of Harry Potter. In any case, whatever direction it goes, it'll be going there without me.There was so much potential here, it's really sad to see it all wasted.",2
"One of the worst things I have ever seen.Dull dialogue, uninspired story, unlikable characters and none of the charm that made us love the Addams Family.Wednesday as a character can't be saved even by the usually excellent Ortega who struggles to bring life to the dialogue that seems to be written by someone who has never spoken to a teenager, a goth teenager or even a human being in general. The little moments of morbidity are not funny and natural but forced and cringe inducing.The polar opposite (Enid) quickly becomes annoying and surprise surprise they are forced into some kind of friendship that Wednesday was trying to fight so hard but ""omg bffs forever I made you a scarf"" is apparently everything she needs to completely change her mind.The Queen Bee Mean Girl Bianca is a shallow cliche whose story goes nowhere and the romantic interests are bad enough to make anyone want to chose a life of solitude.CGI looks like it was made on a potato powered calculator by someone who proudly proclaims graphic design as their passion.The rest of the cast is so beyond forgettable and bad that there is no real reason to waste time on reviewing them.",1
"Awful, Complete Disappointment. It was very difficult to continue watching. Childish waste of time! Cold & Empty. This show was really for poor me. Don't waste your time. Unwatchable. Very disappointing result sadly from one of my favorite directors. Cringe. TERRIBLE! Worst results I've witnessed. Wrong actress to play the role I'm sure someone else would have played it better I cant compare it to Christina Ricci' she was so much better and yet I see so many people overrating and exaggerating the actress whos playing the role, I feel like they have ruined one of my favorite TV families for me in this show, I would advice others not to watch it if they dont want the Adams family to be ruined for them.",1
"The movie is not a copy paste of previous Addams Family movies if thats what you hope for. Despite people moaning about it, I think its a good thing! People are really narrow minded those days.. why would you even want to watch exactly the same story over and over again? Whats so bad about creating a different story? I found this series to be very entertaining and funny. I can totally relate to some of dialogues too lol. I'm on 3rd episode and so far so good. Haters will hate it becouse their little brains doesnt cope well with the changes. If you are oped minded you will definitely enjoy it. But if you want to watch Addams Family then go and watch Addams Family becouse this is not Addams Family....",8
"The best part of the show is that you can start watching without a single knowledge of the Addams Family, the history itself doesn't work behind the original work. If you look into 'Wednesday' as a single history it might seem made for teens. After watching the whole season is easy to say that Jenna Ortega gave us an amazing Wednesday, the character that by herself uphold the Addams legacy.Tim Burton's view and direct made it so good to watch, even with the bad CGI monster, it doesn't bother to believe in the scene because the actors were being directed by Burton's amazing talent ne vision.Can't wait for season two!",10
"I have been sickened by horrible remakes, reinventing classic characters of the past into convoluted into garbage coming to terms with their personal demons.THIS IS AMAZING!!! BEST REMAKE EVER!!!!!!!!Every character is perfect, the writing is fun. Every actor is spot on. EVERY CHARACTER IS GREAT.Catherine Zeta Jones is mind blowing good.I can watch it with my family. Everyone likes it. Kids who have no idea who the Addams Family is, parents who want something for everyone, Grandparents like me who remember the original series.They get it, it's fun. You will not be disappointed. We weren't.",9
"Aside from some Questionable Casting Choices, I was looking forward to this show. Within 5 minutes I knew I had to throw out any preconcieved notions I may have had about the Addam's family and take this show on its own. None of that is why I have so many problems with this show.This feels like a poorly written cliche New Student at High School complete with Alternagirl being forcibly paired with the Preppy Blond, who gives her a tour of campus complete with ""These are the different cliques and this is what you should think about them, oh and there's the Evil Prom Queen. No one will ever beat her"" to Alternagirl bonds with guy from group she's told to stay away from. And an obvious set up for a love triangle.They might as well and written the script in crayons. The lines for these characters have al been heard before in ""Insert Random TEEN Drama Here"" and brings nothing to the table. They arent even utilized in any creative way.The concept and plot points make no sense. She is being sent to a school for Misfit Children who are different, but the school social dynamics and personalities are EXACTLY the same that have been presented at every High School Set Movie or TV show since Grease! Or even earlier. Outcadt in Name only. Everyone Magically Knows Fencing, Which Brings me to my next point of contention.Wednesday, the central Character (Duh) is presented as someone with a high knowledge base, high level of skill in Escape, Planning, Manipulation, Subterfuge, Fencing (?), Super-Negativity and Non-Conformity. But in her first Escape attempt she fails to consider that making a scene with the Kindergarten Quality Townie Bullies might work against her? That makes no sense. Wednesday's dynamic with her mother Morticia also makes no sense, NOR does the cringey Nick Name Gomez decides to give Morticia. No Itteration of Morticia would EVER deign to be called ""Tish"" WHAT?!Jenna Ortega fails to bring anything new to a character and instead simply copies Christina Ricci's take. Ricci's take was far scarier and leaned heavily on dead-pan delivery than the original TV show. Ortega just does more of the same. I suppose if you think someone can be Star Quality at singing Karaoke, you could enjoy her performance here.On top of my small personal Petty Complaints (The Gomez casting decision, that Kid from ""The Gifted"" who just grates my nerves) All of this together makes the show UNWATCHABLE!",1
"First half - total snoozefest. Second half finally gets some action. I'm not sure who this was made for- 10 year old kids or grown ups? It seemed like neither. The characters - with the exception of Wendy Addams - are so beyond stereotypical that I wanted to vomit. Please!! Stop. Making. Characters. So. Stereotypical. Nobody enjoys this anymore.The storyline is incredibly predictable. It felt like I had seen this a million times before. At this point I am 100% convinced that Netflix has one writer locked up in a room somewhere and he writes all of their shows and movies under different names.The graphics at least look realistic. This was clearly a high budget production. Couldn't they find a few more dollars for a better writer at least?? If you're going to spend so much time and money on creating a Netflix series why wouldn't you want to make it good?? With a storyline this predictable you're basically saying ""We want this to be average AF and that's it"".If you're under 18 you might find this interesting. But if you're over 18 - don't waste your time.",5
"Absolutely beautifully executed in every aspect of the imagination. The score is dark and brooding with strong sound direction and composed with purpose. The cinematography reminds one more of a film than a typical tv series but this is nothing new with the likes of GoT changing the landscape of what can be accomplished behind the camera of a television series. With near perfection in casting, I am sorry, I do agree with most here, Gomez was a mistake and seems to be driven by the choice in the cartoon films. But this is all forgotten with the mesmerizing role that Jenna Ortega performs. You would be forgiven and understood if you were planning on passing off as the latest Netflix dribble, but Wednesday breaks the mold of the last few years of release (of course we have Squid Games and a few other outliers, but for the most part Netflix has a negative net rating on quality of releases) and really delivers a strong story with enjoyable aspects for all different viewer groups. I am a 35 y/o male who typically watches independent films, thrillers or sports and I found this to so enjoyable we watched it twice over the long Thanksgiving Weekend off of work. I would truly recommend this to any and all. While understanding not everyone will love ""Wednesday"", I believe we have a new hit on our hand and can only hope future seasons take us on a deep dive into all things that this season created for us to love.",9
"Honestly excpected this to be horrible like most rated 12 Netflix shows but it was great. Super interesting and a super twisted plot but many cliffhangers.. which is good for a movie and I was addicted and finished it all so fast . It is great and highly recommended. I'm not going to spoil it but the plot is like a rollercoaster and if you don't pay proper attention it won't make much sense. Upset that I've already finished it and I'd say it's family friendly. Might upset younger children though. Any
how I could watch this series forever and ever because it is just amazing and deserves its nominee. 100% recommended and one of my new favourite shows.",10
"This is a bizarre bit of teen rubbish that is actually a fun romp. You just have to ignore the bad acting from many of the younger actors. The main characters do manage to pull off their characters well, but many always sound as if they are just reading their lines, punctuation marks included. Teen high school series are hot right now with every country in the world producing their own versions. This one goes a step further and adds the supernatural twist, but in a fun way. It's all a bit silly, but does keep you engaged despite the level of silliness being off the scale! There's not much to the story as the idea seems to be to move from one crisis to the next, complete with all the special effects available.",6
"I wasn't expecting much from this series and only watched the first episode because of all the fanfare but I was in for a surprise treat.I'm an older person so this show is not pitched at me but I was hooked from the start.Firstly it looks fantastic . Very sleepy hollow.Jenna Ortega is a triumph.Her portrayal of Wednesday Adams is a joy to watch.I'd never seen her before and I'm sure we'll be seeing a lot more from her.The supporting cast is very clever .From Catherine Zeta Jones as Morticia to Christina Ricca as Marilyn Thornton, everyone pulls together
to make a really enjoyable watch .There will be a season 2 without doubt and I'll be watching.",9
"I was glad to see that this show managed to overcome my skepticism. With Tim Burton this seemed like it should have been a perfect match of artist and muse, but the trailers had me concerned.I still find the casting of the majority of the Addams family as the biggest disservice to the series, but they play such brief supporting roles that it allowed Jenna Ortega to be the primary focus and do an excellent portrayal of an older Wednesday Addams.Thanks to the amount of screen time she was allotted, there was ample time to overcome the odd casting choices of the rest of the family. The writing was also exactly what I expected for the character, cold and sharply cutting quick-witted rebuttals that Ortega delivers with the emotional vacancy needed to fit the role.The overarching story is a simple ""who dun it?"" plot that limited the chances of being exposed to plot holes while serving as a vehicle to explore the expanded setting with.All new characters are pretty much high school tropes, even falling into nicknamed cliques and social circles based on what kind of spooky monsters they are, but thankfully Burton dialed back the teen drama that tends to ruin shows like Cobra Kai.I still can't get over the fact that Gomez looks like a meth dealer, and Morticia went from being agelessly regal to looking old and tired. Overall, it still succeeds in being entertaining and accomplishing what it wanted to, with enough plots lingering in the background for more seasons. Each episode had a lot going for it, making them feel longer than they were.",8
"I had really been hoping to enjoy this more. An Addams family related property, in the hands of Tim Burton, how could it not be amazing?Well, unfortunately it was very underwhelming. Overall look is pretty good, actors are all pretty good, but the script was maybe...not what it could have been. Honestly not surprised I later found the writers also worked on Smallville, and the level of quasi teen/high school-ish drama is sort of understandable once I learned that. It doesn't make it great, it makes the character of Wednesday feel less like an Addams though and more like a teeny bopper detective.I would recommend trying it if you haven't, I was really wanting to like it more for the as already mentioned Addams family connection and Tim Burton in director's chair. I couldn't make it past the first episode, but don't let that discourage you. Even though it wasn't for me, it looks like it definitely is finding traction, so I'd say worth trying at least.Was really hoping to at least make it to that dance scene, that looked great on the YouTube clips.",5
"Why? Why would you do this? Why would you take one of the most incredible cast of characters, one of the most thought-provoking set of relationships, and one of the most inspiring families in literature and film and turn it into a joke. Wednesday hating Pugsley? The Addams parents ignoring their kids? Morticia threatening her kid?Do Netflix writers read a Wikipedia synopsis of these shows and think, ""Oh, yea! I've got all the info i need to go ahead and slaughter this beloved gem now"" before they sit down at their desks? It's either that or they are incapable of understanding story telling, character building, and subtlety and just trudge through shelves of beloved stories and movies just assassinating every character they come across. It's infuriating to think that they do this for the sake of money. There's no WAY in hell that this show has an 8 from the general public. It just smells FISHY! And to think that one of my all time favourite directors was an accomplice to this debauchery is even a bigger insult, a nastier spit in the face.I could hardly get through one episode. Anyone who worked on this should be ashamed of themselves.Next time, write your own story before destroying beloved characters that have existed for years that you do not understand.The only reason i gave it 2 stars is because we still need space below the bar for true garbage like 365 days and the like.",2
"Feels more like a spin-off of the show Grim with a detective trying to figure out which monster did it. Once in a while, Wednesday will be Wednesday but majority of the time she's just playing detective.I don't understand the fad with making Gomez Addams a Mexican. His first name is Gomez but his last name is Addams. That's like assuming a guy with the first name of Tony is Italian when his last name is O'Connor. Gomez's brother, Fester Addams and the rest of his family are not Mexican. Call it what you want but I'm just stating facts and I'm not the one that made a short-fat Mexican Gomez Addams in the animated film and this show about Wednesday that isn't actually Wednesday.",3
Wasn't sure what to expect in the Wednesday series I was a fan of the original Addams family and the movie is that followed but this look pretty interesting especially that Tim Burton was the one who did this and I'm a big fan of nightmare before Christmas so I gave it a go and I really enjoyed it they picked the perfect girl to be Wednesday she nailed it I know a lot of people say that they didn't like who they picked to be Morticia and Gomez but I enjoyed them I really dug the plot how it flowed all the way through the whole series and of course I enjoyed they brought back one of my favorite punk bands from the '80s the cramps and their classic goo goo muck for the Ravens dance scene that was really cool looking for to season 2.,10
"Full disclosure I gave up after episode 2:Tim Burton has completely missed the point of The Addams Family (unsurprisingly, given his last 15-20 years of output).Instead of a satire on the American nuclear family, this was a turgid, try-hard, humourless trudge through the most tedious mall-goth clichés.The whole thing is just absolutely charmless, despite honestly decent performances all round. No amount of capable acting and genuinely inspired casting can compensate for the dreadful dialogue and extremely overdone concept.If you're an adult, you'll only like this if you also like those witless slogan t-shirts that say stuff like ""normal people scare me"" or ""I'll stop wearing black when they invent a darker colour"". However, I can see how young teenagers would enjoy this, the same way that they would enjoy the aforementioned slogan t-shirts and base their personality around ""being a Slytherin""",2
"To start let me aknowledge a fact about myself : I breath ""Tim Burton"" like nothing else in this world and I have an utterly strong and undying love for his art ! With that said I'm not saying that I adore every single thing that he creates because sometimes it's just not too Burtony for my taste BUT if I do adore it..I DO !Wednesday was exactly what I wanted it to be ! It's not a horror like all his works but it has horror elements! It's not a kids movie but it could be for the right kids and just like most his work it may look like that but that's the charm of his style - not enough to be labled as anything but a Tim Burgon movie !When I first saw the cast I was really happy to see Christina Ricci's name because if you know Burton you know his Love for Ricci and the fact that she was the previous Wednesday when she was a kid in the 90s Addams Family films so I was pretty happy that he took her onboard but I was not that happy with the choice of Morticia and Gomez at first because I think Eva Green and (especially )Oscar Isaac would be the perfect cast for this duo BUT now when I've seen the show I'm actually very happy with the Catherine Zeta and Luis Guzman as they do not appear in very episode and I would be really unsatisfied if Oscar Isaac was Gomes and he was seen only a few times Jenna Ortega was just outstanding! I first saw her in ""You"" and she instantly became a favorite of mine .She was P-E-R-F-E-C-T-I-O-N as Wednesday and that dance scene was just FIRE
I also REALLY liked the fact that we could still hear Danny Elfman's music and that they used a real man 's hand ( still attached to the man :D) for the role of Thing,when I first se Thing I was mesmerised by how real that hand looked like and I know that Tim Burton is a huge fan of stop motion animation so I thought that it was a doll but it ended up being a grown man creepjnv on the floor and acting as the Thing...which is just as cool as it can get ! The styling,costumes, make up I don't thing there is any need on talking about it everything was perfect as always and I truly cannot wait for more of this goth icon !!!",10
Other than casting Gomez as a chubby sloth and turning Pugsley into a wimp. The show itself is pretty good. As I recall Gomez was into jumping on his trampoline as well as being an expert at fencing. Why turn him into an out of shape overweight person? In my opinion this is where the ball was dropped. Wednesday and Morticia's characters are well cast. Too bad about the other two misses. Pugsley and Gomez should have been casted better. Not really trying to take away from the actors that are portraying them. It is just that these two actors do not really fit the parts that they are playing. Sorry.,5
"Don't watch this expecting a return of the old classic style or even anything like it.Sadly this is just a over done cheesy teen series.Obviously it's never going to match the old stuff but I was expecting this to at least be watchable and relatable to it.Gomez and Morticia are odd and not in a good way. Wednesday is overkill and pushed to the extreme of her character and everyone else is just cringe bad music and script maybe I don't know.Not a lot going for it other than the look of it they played too much to the ""teen"" thing it's horrendous.Thing is the only character that's awesome mainly because he doesn't say anything.",2
"For the people who aren't versed in the universe of social media, you wouldn't really know that Wednesday is having the same effect on Gen Z as Stranger Things and Top Gun: Maverick, IT'S BLOWING UP EVERYWHERE! When I began to see the countless amounts of TikTok's of people dancing and imitating the mannerisms of Wednesday Addams, I knew I had to take the time to sit and watch the culture phenomenon for myself.I have seen some of the Addams Family movies in the past but they were never my things to be honest. With that being said, I didn't really have some idea of where this show was going to go. After taking 2 days to finish I can confidently say that I like what I have seen. Jenna Ortega's performance of Wednesday Addams was top tier. Watching her portray this dark and moody teenager in the beginning turn in to a less moody teenager that deep down cares about the people close in her life was truly special. Also watching a hand as a sassy sidekick was as entertaining as can be since he has no mouth. I give Wednesday an 8/10, good on the verge of something great.",8
"In my opinion, the series is quite simple. The plot is too fast. A lot of events happen in one episode and it feels like a lot of things are cut out or not thought out, because there are a lot of moments when certain questions arise. The director was Tim Burton and I could feel his style. As I said, the series is quite simple in its own way, some moments are just banal, obvious and predictable. But despite this, the series is watchable in one breath. The setting and atmosphere just drew me into this series, the humor in the series in the style of the old ""Addams Family"" as it should be, and Jenna Ortega showed herself perfectly.",8
"I was looking for something to watch that wasn't entirely reflective of the real world (too many cancer story plots making me sad).I was hooked on this show after the first episode. It's great. I really enjoyed being whisked away to this world . Jenna ortega (Wednesday) played the role flawlessly. Her acting and tone really set the scenes. The storyline is very interesting with a few twists and turns and keeps rolling with the the theme of ""who is it"".I enjoy Tim burton films in general and this felt like a longer tim burton films split into a series. The lighting and ""feel"" in the scenes just make me happy. Weirdly nostalgic to Tim's other work.Overall yes :)",8
"I absolutely loved this. Jenna Ortega was unbelievable as Wednesday. Every part of her personality and facial expressions were on point and kept me watching. The dance scene was my absolute favourite and I'm not sure how she managed to keep a straight face when acting out that scene. The storyline was great with an unexpected twist. I love fantasy creatures so it added to my enjoyment. I enjoyed this so much I binge watched it over 5 evenings.I hope there is a season 2.I'm not sure if the right actor was chosen for Uncle Fester, it didn't sit quite right for me, but that's just being picky.",9
"Principal Weems death was short sighted. Her scenes with Wednesday were riveting. G. Christie's' experience and magnetism fills the screen. There are no rules in the world of magic. If you can bring back GOT's John Snow, you can bring back Ms. Weems!Also, I am a big fan of Luis Guzman. Hats off to the creators for portraying the comic strip origins. The problem is the lack of chemistry between his Gomez and Morticia. Next season, if approved, I suggest you take advantage of his appearance. Make Gomez less soft. More take charge type. More dangerous. He can love his family, but you don't mess with him. He'll become more attractive that way. Remember James Cagney, and Humphrey Bogart? Not too pretty, but they had the ladies lined up!",10
"I really, really loved the overall acting, colors...
I didn't expect this at all, like, this kind of story and mystery kind of genre... Netflix really did an amazing job!There is some funny scenes, made me laugh...
I finished this series in one day, I binged watched it and I just couldn't stop even tho I was tired...
I want season 2 asap hahahha
I like the way this series made us guess who might be the villain in the story, came up with a few but it's well made and it's tricky, you can't really be sure 100%...
I love a good mystery! ?
Love the overall vibe of this, I'd honestly give 10/10 and I'm really picky when it comes to series.",10
"SEASON ONE REVIEWA series with Jenna Ortega as Wednesday Addams and directed by Tim Burton could be something spectacular, but personally it was not as spectacular as I expected.I wasn't sure where the series was going to go and it turned out that it was the typical teen show about teenagers solving mysteries, which has fed me up, these types of shows abound nowadays, I was wondering if Jenna Ortega and Tim Burton can save this show, and they did since everything I liked has to do with them.Jenna Ortega's performance is the best the series has to offer, it's not complex at all but she knows how to play Wednesday and without being expressive, it's seen that she enjoys the character, but the other characters.....the other Addamas are fine, no they shine a lot but they do it well, all the others without forgetting them and something clitches. Tim Burton's style is present, I love the settings among other things but the problem is that.... They do not shine at all, they do not have moments where these details are noticed and they simply remain as something in the background.The Addams are weird in each of their versions but in this one... they almost always just say they're weird but they almost never show it. I would have liked them not to show it anymore and that the Addams shine more than just Wednesday. As a last complaint, the cgi is terrible.Enjoyed the series, but was hoping for something slightly better.",6
"As a fan of the 1990's Addams family films, I was a little apprehensive to watch this show but my daughter talked me into it and boy am I sure glad she did. Jenna Ortega is a brilliant Wednesday! Sure there were parts I compared to ""my"" version I grew up with, but I loved this take on Wednesday's story. (I hate that I have to type 600 words to tell you I really enjoyed this show.) I had read that Jenna Ortega took up fencing and piano, and even did her own choreography...which for the record, I absolutely loved. Really hoping we will get to see more! Oh and small spoiler....try to see if you can catch Wednesday blinking.",10
"WEDNESDAY is not The Addams Family, so much so that I'm wondering if Tim Burton has ever seen the show, movies, or read the comic strip.The show is goth Harry Potter. Literally a complete Rowling ripoff:A young teenager with budding powers gets sent to a magical school for magical kids. They befriend the bumbling nerd and over-achieving girl. They discover they're the chosen one, destined to take down a leader of an evil cult that was believed to be defeated. The cruel professor has secretly been in love with one of the child's parents.The school is even separated into different groups who compete against each other and the protagonist gets recruited onto a team and is the reason they win.Zero Addams. Overflowing with Hogwarts.",5
"This series has a few fatal flaws, but chief among them is the fact that this series is no different than any modern Netflix series aimed at teens: angsty unrealistic depictions of being a teenager, random bore romantic subplot, catty girl fights, etc. The fact that it's Wednesday Addams becomes background noise once the drama starts.Wednesday herself is depicted here like so many Aubrey Plaza wannabes, and has no real personality other than ""I'm a goth!"" Great.The worst of the worst however has to be the other main members of the Addams clan, Morticia and Gomez. In what is supposed to be a constant tongue-in-cheek flirtatious relationship is completely annihilated by the fact that Catherine Zeta-Jones wouldn't be in a romantic relationship with Luis Guzman, ever. My ability to suspend disbelief was impossible watching those 2 on screen.It's not just physical, either. Luis plays Gomez's dialogue...very strangely. Like a raspy whisper. I do not understand this choice. Any time those 2 are on screen I lose all interest in watching.The main storyline isn't compelling enough for me to stay. Yet another IP mined by Netflix for nostalgia yet they then completely ignore the nostalgic bits that made it popular in the first place. What's the point? There is none. Like this series.",2
"Whilst performances and characters stay true, the story becomes transparent and predictable.Though it's undeniably fun, it was mismatched with gore and innocent sub-plots, as though it's target audience was unclear.With the classic family back on-screen over a series of episodes, the feeling of excitement was summoned and buried reasonably quickly after learning the storyline would last the entirety of the season, leaving many wasted opportunities and a thin plot.Delightfully dark sets, familiar family-favourites and ace acting; a perfect combination to resurrect the cultist-classics. Yet, the previous are all let down by lack of attention to detail, infecting a wearing story that loses it's theme quicker than zombies and limbs.Brilliant casting, though a spoiler in it was staring back through a foggy mirror.",6
"So now, it's 2022, and a gorgeous... and I mean GORGEOUS... girl in black clothes... a Goth girl... she's walking down the hallways of a high school... and she's GORGEOUS, did I mention that?Okay, so this GORGEOUS girl in black clothes is walking down the hallway and the boys and girls all hate her, want nothing to do with her... Instead of every confident boy trying to get her attention as if their lives depended on it... you know, like REAL life...What Tim Burton doesn't realize is it's no longer the 1950's or early 1960's, and cute Goth chicks are commonplace...It would be far more realistic if a well-dressed kid roamed the campus and was hated for being so darn normal, average, mundane... Because Things have changed and Burton's still living in another world with the same kind of underdogs who are now the norm.... The outcasts are popular and have been basically since the 1990's...Aside from the premise of Wednesday Addams being shunned for... basically acting like a smug teenage girl (who is GORGEOUS by the way)... there's the inevitable attempt to wedge in her famous parental characters from the series and the movies, Morticia and Gomez, and yet both actors, CZ Jones and Luis Guzman, seem not only peripheral to the story, but have no connection with each other, and worse yet, their daughter...People are comparing this to Harry Potter, but being set in the special school full of young student monsters, from vampires to werewolves, it's more like Twilight with what should be a sense of ironical dark humor... which Tim Burton helped create decades ago...But WEDNESDAY has no real connection to the past of Tim Burton, the cult TV series or cult-mainstream films... feeling more an attempt to bank on a franchise that was different in the first place and, instead of giving it a darker, more edgy slant, it's actually become mainstream and, in this case, extremely bland.",1
"The consensus is that this show is just great, but I am a contrarian here. I find the Wednesday character's deadpan and serious portrayal uninteresting, annoying and humorless. The expected Addams Family campiness and their winking and being in on the joke about their over-the-top gruesomeness is completely absent - except when the other family members themselves show up. The consistently strange thing is that the students at the school for outcasts who are werewolves, sirens, ghouls and the like seem more 'normal' and freaked out by the supernatural than the actual normal folks in the neighboring town. The overall writing and overarching story line is generally pretty good but I for the most part can't stand Wednesday's on-screen presence which kind of makes watching this show a chore rather than a pleasure for me.",4
"As the title suggests this spin off from 'The Addams Family' is centred on daughter Wednesday. In the opening scenes Wednesday is expelled from school for releasing piranhas into the swimming pool... while it was in use. She is sent to Nevermore, the boarding school for outcasts that her parents attended. Even here she doesn't really fit in. Soon after she arrives she witnesses a monster kill one of the students; unfortunately nobody believes her so she decides to investigate herself. This leads to some trouble with the local sheriff who has history with her family. She must also contend with her developing psychic power and other students, including her perky werewolf roommate who is determined to be friends.I never watched the original TV version of 'The Addams Family', but enjoyed the 1990s films, so for me Christina Ricci is Wednesday Addams... at least she was until I watched this. Thankfully the makers took the character in a somewhat different direction; she is still morbid and dressed in black but this Wednesday is older, not as pale and rather than having a large forehead has a fringe that almost covers her eyes... This meant that it was very easy to accept somebody else in the role. Jenna Ortega does a really fine job; she really makes the character her own. The other characters are interesting and the cast is solid. The story provides laughs, thrills and some good scary moments. The various special effects, especially the monster, are really good. The central mystery develops nicely. This is nicely intertwined with various single episode plots. The main mystery is nicely wrapped up in a single season but the end clearly hints at an intention to make more... I certainly hope they do. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to older fans of 'The Addams Family'; scary scenes mean it is probably unsuitable for younger children.",9
"I accept the fact that the other family members have like zero screen time. Okay so it's called Wednesday for a reason, however it would be more enjoyable if I saw the other characters a little more. A big reason for that is that Wednesday is completely unlikable and that's a big problem. What I loved about the previous Adam's movies is that The Addams Family Had each other's back. Wednesday hates her family and treats her friends like trash. Unfortunately it's not done in a charming way. I feel like they went too far with making Wednesday cold and they took away her substance. This is a huge flaw because you have to be able to like the character and care about them. I think that the show could improve if they realize this and make Wednesday more tolerable. No one can play Wednesday like Christina Ricci, however the actress did a good job. The problem lies within the writing, I actually hope for a season 2, but I hope they improve the actual problems because this could be a good show. Maybe give Wednesday a soul and make her a bit more charming. The Adams were always good people who enjoyed being different and I embrace that. In this one, no one has a personality and all the characters lack charm, especially Wednesday.",4
"Can't actually believe how good this was! Had me hooked from the very start. The last few episodes were unbelievably well written and acted. Jenna Ortega is the absolute BOMB! Recently watched a movie called The Fallout starring Jenna and WOW she has you hooked from the very start!! Stunning young girl and unbelievably talented! My favorite up coming super star actor! Can't wait for the 2nd install of Wednesday! Like soooo excited! That's coming from a 32 year old man! Just think later and delve straight in to this watch and I can guarantee you will not be disappointed! A legendary family and era reborn! Truly brought back memories of the old days, watching The Adams Family! THE THING is so cool! Visually this adaptation is a masterpiece. At times reminded of how the movie - Sin City was shot/produced. Dark, eerie, visuals, with a hint of slash cut/genius! 10/10 watch! Jenna Ortega ????????????????????????",10
When the fundamental characteristics of the main character are changed for no logical reason but the script bowls along seemingly oblivious to these changes then what other wise could have been a half decent product is ruined. I'm guessing this is supposed to be a comedy but I just didn't find it funny. The gags are very predictable and rolled out on cue. I wonder who the target audience is for this show. Maybe Harry Potter fans? The original series was a lot more entertaining in my opinion. This just feels like the ideas department at the movie studio were hitting a dry spot and so decided to try and cash in on something that was done well in its day but by trying to adapt it to a contemporary setting totally ruined it.,3
"WEDNESDAYDirector: Alfred Gough and Milles Millar
Stars: Jenna Ortega, Gwendoline Christie, RiKi Lindhome, Jamie McShane, Hunter Doohan and Percy Hynes White
Genre: Comedy, Crime, Family, fantasy, Mystery
episode: 8 episodesI've really been looking forward to this series for a long time and that while this is my first contact with the addams family. I'm going to say right away that the character they've picked is really fantastic to make a spin-off about. Jenna Ortega plays really, really well and it's that I don't like horror that much, otherwise I would really like to see more of her in similar roles. At first the series reminded me a bit of Harry Potter and you can also compare it to that. That is where my first point of criticism comes in, and that is that it sometimes looks a bit too much like Harry Potter. Sometimes things have been taken literally and I thought that was a bit of a shame. I don't mean to say that I think the series is stolen, but it could have had a bit more of its own style (especially at the beginning), especially with regard to the school. The characters in the series are really, really nice. What I also really like about those characters is that they all have a little caracter arch. Not a very big one, just big enough in my opinion for a first season. What I also liked was that the Addams family also gets a little more backstory in the series. I will now go straight to my last point of criticism and that is that the series is perhaps a bit too much aimed at children. Yes, it is really very dark at times, but I would have preferred that the dialogue, for example, be a little less aimed at children. What I also want to say is that the soundtrack is really fantastic again. I definitely recommend watching this series. If I had to describe this series in short I would say that it is a nice spin-off with nice side characters but that is a bit too much aimed at children. There are some parts that gave me goosebumps. I'm mainly talking about the final episode.7.7/10.",8
So I'm gonna start with that I had no high expectations going into this as Netflix is either a hit or miss.I don't remember the last time I did a review for a Netflix show probably Stranger Things and I felt that there was such a nostalgic but yet something very fresh about the show.Jenna Ortega played Wednesday Adams perfectly and I do think she brought a breath of fresh air to the show.I'm glad the focus was on Wednesday (Show named after her duh!) with little glimpses of her family. I do think this is a great debut to the Adams Family and I cant wait for season 2.This show is not for everyone but will certainly please people who like Mystery.,8
"Aimed at 12 and up. Content might be to hard for some 12 years old.Another teen horror love whodunit series. (Not using romcom because it is too limiting)The horror, gothic thing is done nicely.The love portion was unnecessary.And whodunit was pretty obvious. It's the usual suspects and who doesn't fit with the rest question.What carried it mainly was Jenny's character portrayal,walking and spitting out one liners.She has a good hit ratio with her one liners, with the exception of her roomie the others haven't.It's questionable to have so many one liners though but again only some of them are duds.And Emma's bubbly personality, hopping and just being the friend who you would love to have.The score is done by Danny Elfman. While he delivers the same quality as you come to expect it becomes a bit much when you bingewatch the series.I thought I would see the hand of Tim Burton more but that was not the case.Episode length is great and the show most of the part moves at a good speed.There is not the overuse of obvious special effects so they would dominate the screen as say marvel or dc.I Don't know if I would watch a second series. This one was okay. Which to be honest is a surprise.Lately I have watched a lot of anime. Because of art style, storytelling and originality.This checked the same boxes.",6
"Oh my goodness! Hands down, the best series this year and the best Netflix production in years!Where do I begin? With Jenna Ortega, of course. She first caught my eye in YOU. But you know how some actors are born for a certain role? Jenna was born to star as Wednesday Addams! Some people pointed out in their reviews that it is all about her - well, duh! Who else should it be about? I mean, do not get me wrong, the rest of the cast was pretty awesome, too! My favourites were Emma Myers as Enid and Percy as Xavier. And Christina Ricci as a guest star? Amazing! Also, Catherine Zeta-Jones was a good choice for Morticia.To sum it up, where Sabrina failed, Wednesday most certainly delivered. 10 out of 10.",10
"The character of Wednesday is played by Jena Ortega, while Tim Burton, Gandja Monteiro, and James Marshall are the directors of the production. Wednesday is one of the best new shows on Netflix, but the streaming service's original productions may not be for everyone. She displays all of the character's peculiarities, coldness, and cruel comments, yet in such skilled hands, Wednesday is neither cartoonish nor one-dimensional, displaying remarkable depth instead. In this series, Tim Burton's penchant for morbid humour and passion for the macabre, as well as his love of Hammer Horror films, are on full display. Even the supporting cast is excellent, highlighted by Emma Myers as Enid, who is able to bring out the best in our heroine despite the fact that she is colourful. This programme is going to be right up your alley if you liked the last iteration of Wednesday Addams. This young actress has a promising career ahead of her in Hollywood, particularly due to the mesmerising performance she gave in the film.",10
"Juat finished watching Wednesday series 1 , loved it absolutely brilliant , actors were great, story told very well and had my interest from the first few seconds
The last episode left me wanting more , so really hoping for series 2, The chosen cast were perfect for each and every role would also like to learn more about morticia and gomez tine at nevermore before Wednesday and what other problems Wednesday faced before hand.The director and production team made a brilliant job of the series and this is the first series I have ever watched from start to finish , can't wait for series 2 please.",10
"Not a bad pass time.. though I would say the first episode is the strongest. Its bingeable and I like its style. Tbh I find it to be quite a strong copy of CAOS (chilling adventures of Sabrina) in cinematography, styling, aesthetics & some character plots. Though Sabrina was definitely better for seasons 1 & 2 b4 they ruined it no turning back season 3 sadly. So maybe this will last longer as even though not as strong a first series Netflix could ve trying to make up for the Damage they did to CAOS and hopefully will keep good writers on and not put anything out thats not ready or thought through Ortega acted well and totally carried her character... The Thing the Hand was the most loveable character/feature on the show. Tbf there wasnt anyone I didnt like. I will likely watch season 2 if they make one.",6
"As a fan of the Addams I was really exited to watch the series, especially since it's highly recommended on the Internet.In my opinion, the show seems off. The main character, Wednesday, is just a bratty teenager that gives off the most cringey vibe. The second hand embarrassment that'll get from this show is real.The writing is just bad... It's full with teenage school drama that I don't really get and the word 'patriarchy' thrown around for wokeness points. The jokes aren't funny, nor witty, they are there to fill some pages and some screentime.I'm glad that there are people who really like the show, but for me it's just a parody of a reboot.",2
"I have mixed feelings about Luis Guzman as Gomez, and Pugsly's character is weak and forgettable, but it's not about either of them. This is Wednesday! Jenna Ortega absolutely shines in this role. Her pithy, yet stoic quips are flawlessly executed (she almost never blinks). She embodies all the charm, and commands the respect you'd want out of that character. I can't think of anyone who could do it better. The supporting cast are all great, and even Thing plays an important, and entertaining, role. With Tim Burton at the helm, setting the tone as only he can, and fantastic plot and dialogue writing, this is one of the best shows I've watched in a while. It goes deeper into the Addams Family lore than ever before. It wraps up the story well, but leaves you wanting more. Fans of the old show, movies, or even just fans of spooky whodunnits will all appreciate this series.",10
"Remember the Uma Thurman dance in Pulp Fiction? Maybe the ET jump in a byke with the moon behind? Or maybe that epic scene where Wednesday creates a reverse riot in a play of the summer camp in the old addams movies, that spice of classic feel, that we no longer have in any series or movie anymore, since the 90's, well, we thankfully got it here, we got many classic moments that made me love cinema and tv again, and wednesday, such A GREAT CHARACTER, it's so funny and perverse and vulnerable at the same time, that sarcasm is gold, the only 3 problems I found in this series is 1, Jenna is too attractive, sometimes it was hard to concentrate when I couldnt take my eyes off the actress, guilty!, 2, they miss the original addams song, this show needed it to become a real classic, and 3, the cinematography has the same flaws all modern productions have, excess of blue lights and orange/yellows at night, I guess it's like an industrial formula to make everything faster and cheaper, in the 90's we had beautiful cinematography in movies because they didn't abuse of blues and yellows, they really took their time to make of cinema an ART, saddly the cinema and series of the last 2 decades is too industrial and there's almost no artistic value anymore, which makes all productions cheaper and faster to make but with A HUGE DROP in photography quality :/ besides that everything else was better than I expected, so so good!",9
"A bit disappointing, series is mediocre at best.The casting was a bit of a surprise, and thought greater consideration should have been given to certain characters. The chemistry between Catherine Zeta-Jones and Luis Guzman seemed to be lacking. The best performance was by Thing, as played by illusionist Victor Dorobantu (it was his first acting gig). Mr. Dorobantu should win an Golden Globe and Emmy for his role. Jenna Ortega also played out well, her performance also had award winning potential.Sheriff Galpin's character, played by Jamie. McShane, was great and wish his role had been larger.",5
"Well, who would have thought, started looking like a teeny bopper flick... but what a turn of events, amazing, emotional, action packed, great backdrop from the Adams family. I cannot recommend this enough, what a great production.You can feel Tim Burtons influence, great cinematography, story line was epic, sexy, fun, we want to see more and cannot wait for more.The dark nature of Wednesdays character along with Gomez and Morticia and the brother .. and even thing ... uncle fester making an appearance, wife and I had a nostalgic experience.Christina Ricci ... original Wednesday Adams played a great role, along with the headmistress from GoT outstanding and looked beautiful.",10
"This show was very entertaining and I finished it all in one sitting today. I love a good story between humans, or normies as they are called in the series, and supernatural beings. The twists in this series are quite well hidden, but with just a little bit of foreshadowing that if you pay close enough attention you can discover the mystery before it is unveiled to you. I think the series did a really good job at taking these characters from face value to adding dimension and character flaws that they could grow from in their character development sequences. This was quite the watch and I am hoping season two will measure up.",8
"***Very minor spoilers***The beginning scene of episode one completely drew me in. I thought, cool this is going to be a fun series where we're treated to Wednesday's hijinx as she torments the students at a regular high school. But, that didn't happen. Instead she's shipped off to a school where she can try to ""fit in"" with other outcasts (vampires, werewolves, etc.). I was so disappointed, but I continued to watch... and I'm glad I did.What unraveled was a well written supernatural thriller/murder mystery. The acting, the writing, the plot, the cinematography, everything was top notch. The writers' attention to detail was very welcome, and their subtle (and sometimes overt) references to Addams Family lore was spot on. On top of that, Jenna Ortega's portrayal of Wednesday was just perfect.Of course, there were some small quibbles. Minor plot holes, questionable dialog here and there, and some forgettable teen angst that detracted from the viewing experience. But overall, this was very enjoyable and I would heartily recommend it.",8
"I ejoyed very much the series. Whenever there was a close up on Wednesday face, looking so serious I thought how could she stay so serious the entire scene. She probebly stop for a laugh and come back with the poker face on.I liked it that Wednesday evolve through the episodes. I think she learns that some of her assumptions on the world and the human being were wrong. The last scene when Enid huged Wednesday and she first gave her a 'what the hell are you doing' look and the she huged Enid back, that was a very touching moment, That's the moment when you see the ""human"" side in Wednesday. I hope that Netflix is planing on 2nd season.",9
"I truly wanted to like this series, but it just fell right in line with other teen shows that try too hard to have a mix of supernatural and outcasts. The dialogue felt so forced and awkward half the time, and the other half I was just put off by the acting.I can't say it is terrible because I've seen far worse, but it really is a let down. Now, maybe that's partially me clinging to the nostalgia of old Addams Family shows/movies, but in all honestly I barely remember them, and what I do remember is that Wednesday wasn't this pitiful. If you have absolutely nothing else, sure, throw it on and decide for yourself, but otherwise, spare yourself from this painfully underwhelming show.",3
"A great job by the director and a very good performance by the actress Jenna Ortega, bringing something fresh to the utopian series, such as the new actor hand in hand, very well achieved, giving it humanity. He has been able to narrate the script very well and has a very good staging. With so many movies and series in the world, it's hard to find something that brings a new spark, and this series is one of them. Jenna Ortega has a great future as an actress due to her good performance in this series, the gothic with the terror is a good cocktail that is valid for all audiences, since the bad also takes.",10
Tim Burton absolutely crushed this. Jenna Ortega was born to play Wednesday Addams. The storyline is also very good. I was so shocked by how great this show was. Also-the little references and hat tips to the previous Addams Family and Wednesday just makes you smile.I was very skeptical starting but it is seriously so good. I would say my only complaint is the actor they chose for Gomez... not the Gomez Morticia deserves in my opinion. Other than that this is a total home run. If you haven't watched please do yourself a favor and binge this show.Please god let season 2 be just as good!!!!!!!!,9
"So i just finished watching the latest adams family adaptation, Wednesday. Admittedly, i never really got into the old movies or other adaptations (except for the animated series when i was a kid), but being a long time tim burton fan( which hasn't always been easy), this version intrigued me. My thoughts on the series are.......mixed. Some good, some bad, overall complicated. Jenna Ortega was definitely the stand out, and she acted circles around the rest of the cast. Burtons signature gothic style is all over the screen, and having him work again with danny elfman was definitely a welcome addition for any burton fan. This is easily the best product hes put out in years, which unfortunately isn't saying much since his last few projects have been, just, bad. The story, while being filled with cliches, was certainly enjoyable and kept my interest even through some of the things I didn't like, enough to make me wanna see what was gonna happen next and how it was all gonne end. I'd even say some of the comedy was well done and had some very smartly written joke. However, the show definitely has some flaws. Some of the characters were just straight up annoying, and their performances definitely didn't help. I know the whole adams family thing is ""quirky"", but some characters were definitely trying to hard. Also, like i said earlier, there were so many clichés and cringy lines that it made it a little hard to get through at times. Some of the cgi was just bad, like 90s cereal commercial bad. Also, i found the climax to be a little, well, anticlimactic. Though there was one twist i genuinely didn't see coming, the rest of it was pretty predictable. Overall i cant say this is a bad show, and i would be interested in a season 2, but it's not particularly great either. So, I'd give it an ok.",5
"Jenna Ortega is wonderful as Wednesday. The rest of the cast is great too for the most part. The sets are visually very appealing. And yet, with all that, the series is a disappointment with the lacklustre writing.The first few episodes showed some potential, and the underlying murder mystery plot seems like a good premise at first. However, as the season progresses, each episode is more disappointing than the previous, culminating with a season finale that is not only anti-climactic, but leaves you wondering what the writers and directors were thinking.So much potential wasted. Fred Armisen plays... Fred Armisen. The dialogue turns into something out of Riverdale. The unique appeal of the Addams family as a critique of society by turning social norms inside out is replaced with a Harry Potter clone.Watch only if you enjoy being disappointed like your parents were with you.",6
"To me the acting, clothes and so on... were perfect!Except for some things. Everyone seems to adore her with no clear explanation, all the people are nice except for Wednesday! What I mean is: The idea of only Wednesday being a realistic character while the others are totally unrealistic is very contradictory. What kind of personalities in the characters the serie wants to portray? Realistic or unrealistic? The idea of ""just her"" being the problem does not feel real... Because the majority of people are not merciful.Xavier loves her so devotedly at first sight and went to jail because of her wrong suspicions. I do think that even thought he loves her, he should set limits. People who are cheated from their partners separates but still love them. Same thing should occur with Wednesday! The story transmits the false belief that we can do whatever we want with people who loves us. Even if the belief is true, where is the sense of morality in the serie? The story should teach good things not bad deeds! Mainly because their target audience are children!About the critics that said she is a very rude character, not funny or sympathetic. The intention of the serie is not to show an incredibely positive main character but yes a realistic one who seeks revenge, with some quirky traits (like not accepting hugs if the person is not a close friend)... that is constantly learning through her own mistakes but like I said before I do think the other characters should be more realistic.",9
"Everyone all over the internet seems to absolutely love the new Netflix show Wednesday. It has incredibly positive reviews and it is currently trending on TikTok with people dressing up as the titular character and dancing to the choreography of the now iconic dance scene (although for some reason on a speed up version of Bloody Mary by Lady Gaga, rather than the original song??? I really do not understand the internet).All of this leaves me baffled and confused, like as if I have watched a completely different show than everybody else. The show, in my opinion, is just not very good. Or better, it's just really bad.From the butchering of the main themes of the original Addams family, to the ridiculous storyline, the predictable writing, the cringy dialogue, the acting (exception made for Jenna Ortega's Wednesday, which literally carries the show), the dull love triangle, the teenage drama, I could go on forever.But let's tackle this one issue at a time.Let's start by talking about the original Addams family. The whole point of the Addams family was to satirize and completely invert the trope of the perfect ideal American family. To do so, the original comic book (and the subsequent 60s tv show and 90s films) sets this family of ""outcasts"" (as the show likes to call them), where everyone dresses in black, is pale, has fascination for the macabre, and simply doesn't care about what society thinks or expect of them, in the most normal place you could think of: the suburbs. And that is where the strength of the original saga comes from: this contrast between the seemingly perfect American family, where everyone is preoccupied with their appearance and how society perceives them, hiding how secretly unhappy they are, and this grim loving family where between torture and grave digging, everyone is happy and loves and cares for one another.The Wednesday show however decided to take a different route, by placing the titular character away from her family, in a special school for outcasts. However, by placing Wednesday in a school full of werewolves, vampires, sirens, and other cliché monsters from ""The Monster Mash"", she just loses her spark. Are we really supposed to believe that literal monsters are scared and weirded out by a regular girl who dresses in black, doesn't blink often and sometimes plays the cello? For this reason, and since I guess the original sociopath with murdering tendencies was too boring for Tim Burton, the writing team decided to give her a superpower: the ability to randomly see the future when she least expects it, just like in the much better ""That's so Raven"" (good job Mr. Burton!).Changing the setting however wasn't enough for them, so they decided to insert some drama in the family, to spice things up: a secret murder backstory for the beloved Gomez and Morticia, who lack any trace of chemistry (unrelated but I had to point it out), and by adding an unnecessary conflict between Wednesday and her mother. And for what concerns the last point, I have seen many people defending it by saying ""she's a teenager, every teenager has conflict with their parents at that age. It's perfectly normal family dynamics"". But that is exactly where the problem is: the Addam's family, by definition, is the opposite of normal, so this classic teenage drama and rebelliousness doesn't really fit the character.But let's move on to the storyline, shall we?To keep it simple, Wednesday gets sent by her parents to this school of outcasts, where a monster is on the loose, killing both students and normies (that's how the show refers to regular people). Among this chaos, Wednesday has a vision of impending doom, having to turn herself into a hero and investigate in order to save the school, while dealing with school drama and a love triangle, where she has to choose between a boring and plain white guy that vaguely looks like Evan Peters, and another boring and plain white guy that also vaguely looks like Evan Peters, but with slightly longer hair (Oh boy, can't wait to see who she ends up choosing). All of this is accompanied by some of the cringiest dialogues I have ever witnessed, gifting us with lines such as:""Wow, you're in black and white... Like a living Instagram filter""
""When I look at you, the following emojis come to mind. Rope. Shovel. Hole.""
""You're just kind of kooky"" ""I prefer spooky"".The plot is extremely predictable, including its numerous alleged twists, and it culminates in an extremely silly battle that looks as if it came out straight from a Disney channel original movie, with a zombie pilgrim from the 1600 who vouched to burn all outcasts, who uses his magic staff to try to burn the school down. Wait, but if he can use magic, doesn't that make him and outcast too? Also in the flashback he didn't really use magic, or am I wrong? And what was the point of reanimating him anyways? I don't know and I simply don't get it.One more thing and then I swear I'll be done. This is more of a pet peeve of mine, so it's not really a big deal, but it still really bothers me. Thanks to Wednesday's vision, the show introduces us to an Addams family's ancestor from 400 years ago: Goody Addams (yes, I agree, it's a really silly name). The whole witch thing and vision powers is implied to come from Morticia's side of the family, which is also the main reason of the conflict between the two. It's Morticia the only other person in the family that has visions. It's Morticia that gives Wednesday additional information on this ancestor. It's Morticia that gives her the magic amulet that later, with the help of Goody, will save Wednesday's life.But Morticia's last name is not Addams, it's Frump. So I guess she got the witch power from both her mom and her dad? Couldn't they simply make her an ancestor from the mother side, to fit the storyline that they wrote more? Also, I find it hard to believe that they managed to maintain the same family name for 400 years. Especially, considering that Goody is a woman, and we live in a patriarchal society were we take our father's name. Did the writers thought that if they gave her different last name, or no last name at all and just called her Goody to make it simpler, the audience would have been too stupid to understand that they were related? Even though the character in the flashback is played by the same actress? I know it's a stupid hill to die on, but it really bothers me.That said, the show manages to not be a complete disaster simply because of Jenna Ortega's performance, who as I said before, literally carried the show. She really managed to portrait a more mature and emotional version of the character without losing the essence. And considering the script she was given, she did an absolutely phenomenal work, especially in the dance scene, which was truly iconic. Thanks to her, and her alone, a show that would have been completely unwatchable, turned into mediocre but easy to binge series, raising the rating from 2/10 to a 4.5/10. So, koodos to her.P. S. Having a subplot about a girl failing to turn into a werewolf and therefore failing her parents expectations, who want to send her to a conversion camp, implying a clear parallelism with being gay in a conservative family, to later have her suddenly and randomly turn into a werewolf just for the thrill of a final battler is kind of shitty.",4
"HURRY UP & GIVE US SEASONS 2-5!!! I loved it. I have never been interested in the Addams Family enough to watch the original series or the movies. But this looked intriguing. At first, i was afraid that Wednesday's monotone demeanor & seemingly better-than-everyone-at-anything abilities was going to quickly get old & obnoxious. But then you keep getting to see little bits of different emotions, & doubts, & failures, & vulnerabilities. Just enough to keep me liking her more & more as it goes on. I was hooked. Jenna Ortega & Tim Burton made her (& the rest of the story) a lot deeper & more addictive than i expected, and i am craving more.PLEASE don't let this be another show that Netflix cancels for no good reason. Keep it going. And while you're at it, also bring back Dark Crystal.",9
"I really liked the show, (it was amazing) but it seems like to extend the show, we were given multiple mysteries.Like the parent's mystery. That doesn't really affect the main plot accept for making the sheriff slightly nicer.I would love to see more like this from Tim Burton and from Jenna Ortega.Also with the coming of this show, maybe we will get to see a Netflix glow up. It is safe to say that Netflix hasn't been amazing lately.Solid 9/10This message is filling up space. This message is filling up space. This message is filling up space. This message is the final one taking up space.",9
"What a perfect and contemporary take on the Adam's Family. First, the casting is inspired and looks closest to the original cartoon, but also honors the classic 60's show and the 90's movies. One of the 90s actresses, Christina Ricci stars as one of the many eccentric characters that inhabit this beautifully dark world Tim Burton creates for us. The asthetic scenery coupled with the location and costume design makes watching this show a treat. Every detail meticulously crafted to better the story and our own enjoyment. Ortega, who plays Wednesday is excellent. She takes what others have done before and really hone in and round out the characters potential. But she doesn't have to do it alone. As our mystery progressis the show is full of great actors bringing their A game to every outcast, classic character, or new hire. This is much watch. Burton at his best...",9
"I remember watching and appreciating The Adams Family with Christina Ricci as a kid. No, I haven't seen the original and don't care about the comparisons. Anyway, I went into this one with no expectations and was not disappointed. There were good references, but the writer, director, and cast made this their own story and did a phenomenal job. It sucked me right in with the incredible cast and characters along with the murder mystery. Definitely some twists and turns to keep you on your toes. Plenty of dark humor, and great dialogue. I really enjoyed seeing the growth in some of the characters as well. I flew through the season faster than expected. Suffice it to say Wednesday kept my attention. Can't wait for more seasons!",10
"Beautifully crafted series. Never read the manga, so I can't comment on how faithful it is. But it has good acting and character development. The cinematography and set designs are beautiful. Good plot that kept me goed al the way through. If you like movies such as Battle Royale, you'll love this show.",10
Rationality always wins. I love japanise culture. Only people using their mind survive.,10
I dont like this type of genre. But what a show. Thks is superb tv,10
I enjoyed this one alot. The dialogue is a bit cliché at times but other than that i love it.,9
Only one episode in but hooked. The acting is amazing. The idea is both super interesting and horrifying. A show of smarts. I'd be dead already. Can't wait to watch more.,10
"This show has a fun premise with great production. Some episodes are very strong and worth watching, but otherwise, the show is littered with poorly written characters that at times are acted out very stiffly. You can feel the actors going overboard or are poorly acting out a few too many scenes. The plot manages to hold interest but messes up small details that would often leave you face-palming or shaking your head.Overall, the show is a far cry from the 10/10 rating many reviews seem to be giving it... Think of it like a good way to mindlessly pass the time.",7
"As someone who's a big fan of the manga, I think the Netflix adaptation does a decent job for anyone trying to find more Alice in Borderland content. However, the devil is in the details, and except for the main story arcs, it's quite different from the original story.Many characters are introduced earlier than expected, and some games have changed concepts entirely. Certain story beats are shuffled around or erased. In addition, Arisu participates in several games that he wasn't part of originally. I would have to say to avid fans of the manga to watch this series pretending you have no prior knowledge unless you like to be disappointed. But by itself, it was spectacular to watch this interpretation of Alice in Borderland.",7
"Top Notch Seat Edge Thriller !!
Cinematography & Soundtracks Are Mind-blowing!!
If You Are Thriller Fan , Then Watch it!",10
Awesome survival game series. I was waiting for this type of series. Great acting and decent effects. and fun to watch.,10
"Great production without long tirades, I still gave 10 stars as I look forward to the rest.",10
"Watched a lot of films and serie. And I can tell you ""This was so awesome""!!! they did play with my heart when I watched the full serie. I really thought I was with them the hole time it felt so real. #Thank you #curious & exited for season 2-Stephaniesx314",10
"The first few episodes felt fresh and exciting, but dipped in the middle and I kept hoping for the latter episodes to reach a climax and in parts it seemed like it was on the way there, but then kind of fell flat in the end.The plot itself isn't bad at all and definitely binge worthy, but can't rate higher than 6 because of terrible acting. Cringey and awkward all round. I've seen some of the actors in other films/dramas and I know they can do much better, so I assume the fault lies with the director himself.",6
"If you love the concept of a show revolving around games of life or death this is for you. Think of the Escape Room or Saw movies, but inspired by Alice in Wonderland. I wonder give you more but tye show is best not knowing anything going in. I guaranteed you will not be able to wait for Season Two. Oh God Netflix don't cancel this after one season. My heart would break. I highly recommend it.",10
The plot of thus show is great you never new what will happen in the show,10
"The story is great, keeps you guessing and it makes you try to figure out what would you do if you were in the games !!! A nice mix of battle royal , saw , scape room and of course the analogy to Alice in wonderland. A must watch show",10
"Oh man, this is nuts, probably the best tv show I've watched in 2020. when I first heard about this series I was excited and also worried. Because in past most manga or anime adaptations were so bad. After watching 1st episode my mind was clear and I know this series going to be epic. Director Sato Shinsuke excellently brought this manga into the real world. The plot is like the mix of hunger games and escape room but Alice in Borderland is much more than those two. In hunger games they just kill each other for survival, escape room there are different games but limited to a building. But in here we have games + open world. it's good if There were more backstory for the character I was interested in. About the acting our protagonist Ryohei Arisu act by Yamazaki Kento he was great in this series, the way he expresses feelings is so natural. I am very impressed with the supporting cast they did an excellent job. There were few uses of CGI and they are good. About Cinematography I loved it, in an episode there two battels in those battels the way they use slow-motion effect is great. This hard R rated show full of valance and blood. I highly recommend this show to watch. Then have a nice ride with Alice in Borderland.",9
"This is an amazing show, fantastic, thriller, action, dramatic, everything you can imagine, it's an amazing story and I cant wait for season 2",10
"Very intense, many interesting characters, not like: ""I have seen all this a hundred times already."" I can recommend! :)",10
"As a manga reader, this series has shocked me and delivered everything perfectly! The storyline exactly follows the original content without anything new or strange. Also, I just thought how crazy it was to how identical the actors looked! The whole show looked so realistic, including the strong emotions and the settings. It was able to touch my heart better than the manga in my opinion. The story progresses very smoothly and has a great balance of the action and character development. It ended perfectly at the right time but also at the same time where I wanted to watch MORE! I was only disappointed when I had to stop at the last episode :[",10
"This was the most fantastic display of absolute and utter nonsense, that I've seen in a long while. It's hard to pick which was worse; the acting, the writing, the directing or the storyline - I believe in the end, it was a magical combination of total lack of talent in all areas, that made this cringe-fest so painfully entertaining to watch.It's like it was written by someone who's never witnessed human interaction before and performed by androids who lack the full programming to be able to pass as actual humans. The dialogues are so bizarre and the directing makes you scratch your head and wonder if the person in change is a toddler or a golden retriever, maybe. Nothing in this production makes any sense, and I'm amazed I managed to suffer through it all. It would absolutely blow my mind if this trash got renewed.",1
"I m now one ep left. The game is good. We get to know some background, the logic stands. Its believable.
Some hundreds of people awake in different parts of a big city as the only inhabitants. After a while it seems that the whole city is controlled so that they regulary play survival games: betray or be dead, logic escape rooms, sports rooms etc. Refuse and die. loose and die. after winning you get on the phone, everyone get one at each game, rewards: 3 says to live. or 9. you get the point. you can live only by playing.
the games are classified each by a playing card: hearts, for ex., are tough. means you only live by betraying a team mate. difficulty is obvious: from one to 10. until now nobody has seen a figure card.
when we get there with this group, youll see, there is already players and a hotel named ,,beach,, where something like a state or mob is installed. the leaders, the muscles(actually, guns) and the plebs. they figured that gathering the whole pack of card will allow one of the a free pass, a visa to the normal world.
the game gets tougher.
a good show. enterteining.",8
"Don't let the criticism/hate get to you and just Ignore the low ratings and watch and judge for yourself. Personally I enjoyed the series! As a manga reader and anime watcher I definitely think they did a decent job with this series in most aspects. Though it is not exactly the same as the manga in some parts it still manages to keep the thrill of it. Yes this concept of escape room and survival of the fittest is used a lot, But trust me this series was super interesting and kept my family of all ages entertained. Hopefully they don't cancel this and will release a 2nd season! Don't sleep on this masterpiece.",10
"While the game premise may be not new, the series is still interesting from start to finish. Despite relatively short series and many characters, able to build up interesting backstories for some of the characters very well with great effect on viewer's emotion.
The sound track and acting are good. CGI is great for TV series. So grateful to make this live TV.
Please note I haven't read manga, haven't even heard of this series before. The cliffhanger ending makes me want for season 2. I finished watching this in 24 hours. Definitely recommended!",10
Surprisingly very good. Definitely watch. I was only going to watch one and ended up watching them all.,9
"* First, this is not for kids! There is a lot of killing throughout the series and some light sex. *If you combined The Purge and The Game you would have Alice In Boarderland! This show is nonstop crazy fun! Hold on to your seat and prepare to binge!",9
The best! Hoping Japan will bring more like this to the Netflix! They are the best in Death survivor games and Mind games genre. Seriously I enjoy Watching this series than Money Heist or any other famous series out there.,10
This is a really great show to watch that has so many different things to look forward to in each episode with unexpected twists.,10
"They were truly able to capture the feeling of the manga.You could feel the anger and sadness from the characters. It still misses a lot of background information about all the characters but what could you expect in a tv series. I loved how they sualized the games from manga to the bigger screen. One of netflix's best manga to live action.
Overal wonderful",10
"AMAZING SERIES!
Must watch!
Especially if you like anime/manga!",9
"Just finished the series in one sitting and can say that it's a solid binge watch.
The way you get used to the friendship in the first episodes and then suddenly lose them was a very unexpected turn, for some reason it felt like it was too soon and then the influx of new faces felt a little over the top for me.
But overall the series kept the interest and would watch the season 2, if renewed.
The ending definitely assumes the continuation and sort of the most exciting part of the games. Really liked the final scene with huge cards",10
"It's really exciting about the first few episodes, the idea is brilliant n sci fic fans surely will love it. But it's becoming quite likely the same for game play to survive....ehhhh patience needed.",5
"I thought this would be that kind of movie where magic appears all of a sudden when it comes to the main characters' death (Karube and Chota). It turned out I was wrong. It saddens me, but I'm not disappointed. I think that what makes this series felt so real and intense! Also, great characters, although sometimes they act a little bit off. I really enjoyed watching it and I'm hoping for a second season!",9
"We all watch different types of tv shows but some of them gives you a unique experience that you didn't feel it with the others. Well that's what happened to me watching Alice In BorderLand, I really got hooked up with the events that took place and I can't wait to see what happened next. Also since that it was inspired from a manga i was afraid since that a lot of other inspirited work ending up being so trashy especially the Netflix adapted one, but this one proves me wrong the characters are really will fit despite the fact that some of them has been introduced way to early in comparison to its manga. Overall i would really recommend you to watch it this was the first review that i have ever did in imdb, but i really felt like it's necessary to share my opinion on this.",10
"This series is so Japanese (and so Tokyo-ish in particular). Characters are transported to another world suddenly, with no explanation. The story flows with all its strangeness and has an open ending (for season 2). The violence, tragedy, and darkness of the series always keep me on edge.
Perfect for binge-watching on the weekend.",8
"From the first episode itself, you will be glued to your seat. It is a thriller and will literally keep you on edge until you finish the entire series in one sitting. A must-watch show if you are looking for an addictive series with a unique plot.",10
"I was amazed after watching the show. Thriller ,excitement all in one. Soon after i start watching i knew it will be a heck of a shoe. Waiting for season 2",10
"Never got bored watching anyway. Brilliant music, camera work etc. I feel like the people putting it down are not being fair on the genre. its not meant to be true to life. Too me it felt like inhabiting the world of a video game at times, which is no bad thing, which is the point of manga, its not meant to be true to life, its life on steroids x 10 (which this is by the way). I also liked the character building a lot. Very much looking forward to season 2, I also finished it in 24hrs.",10
"Seriously, I can't stand when there is a good premise that gets done wrong because of stupid plot holes. Spoiler alert. When the Beach game starts, it says there are 58 participants, yet there are WAY more than that, not just a few more, but considerably more people! They literally just had to change a number to make that hole disappear. I hated how the last few episodes played out. I was a firm supporter before the whole beach story started, but then it just snowballed into oblivion. I'm giving it a decent review just because I did enjoy the first few episodes and I don't want to deter people from watching.",7
"If you like Squid Games or Battle Royal this a MUST watch for you! Yes you!I really felt the need to submit my review, because you can tell the creators put a lot of love in the series and they deserve all the prais (sorry for the bad English).The series has a little but of a slow start because of the character building, but than imidiatly captures you in a twist you probably would not expect. From than on you will be on the edge of your seat. After that, you are hooked. Cant say anything more than that.All of the characters are interresting. The acting is A+ and the concept(s) are cool and as fresh as can be expected.Have fun watching!",9
"Intense & fast paced throughout, but sadly not so much for the last episode. it was all over the place & so much nonsense. 2 girls recording the base, walking around & everyone dont seem to even look at them, did they use invisibility cloak? casually heading to enemy base with no fear nor expecting defense/laser etc.",7
Just going to say that I love that they didn't go easy on recreating It to live action. It's so amazing,10
"I did read the manga a couple of years ago, and I must say that it really is an accurate representation of the series. Really happy to see so much budget put into the series.",10
"I went in after watching the ambiguous trailer and first of all this show is very binge worthy. I will pull you in for entire night. I was hoping this was a limited series but nope, looks like there is going to be a second season.Without spoiling anything, this story starts with three friends getting caught in a simulation type situation which goes in deeper and spreads fast. Each game was designed creatively, in a SAW like fashion where you betray some and sacrifice some. Our lead protagonists are very likeable and worthy of rooting for. They try to give important characters back story which helps us connect.Action scenes are well shot, there is some gore but not at the cost of self gratification. Character representations are tastefully done and plot points are easy to understand yet remain unpredictable to some extent.Kudos to the team, actors, DoP, sound designers, VFX team, writers and production team for such incredible work.Watch it in original language and watch this one for sure.",9
"I haven't read the manga yet still enjoyed watching the stories. I really appreciate the effort from director, staffs and the casts in giving their best; I smiled, shocked (because of Niragi and Usagi) and cried (especially in eps 3). And thank you for the smart and amazing stories coming from the mangaka, Aso Haro for making this work, and for Netflix to make this into live action. Can't wait for the second season!",10
"After 10 minutes I wanted to quit. There was a messaging conversation going on that took minutes. On a personal note, I hate people who are all day long on their phone.
Fortunately I did not quit. What a story, what a character development act... and good actors. For me, one of the best series of 2020. Looking forward for series 2.",9
The pacing is masterful and the execution of the series premise is magnificent. I will be recommending this show to my friends for sure.,10
Edge of the seat thriller....first few epicodes are really amazing.... Kudos to the makers... enjoyed every second.,10
"I have to admit that the show starts interesting, some teenagers move to an alternate universe where you have to play games in order to survive. It builds up to more complex games and even some of the initial main persons die in the games.But the moment the series move to the beach it becomes ridiculous and completely unbelievable. We have a huge group of good-looking teenage kids walking around in bikini/swim suits (so you can't hide guns...right), partying most of the times. What happend to all the older people they met before they went to the beach? Older people aren't able to find the beach?
The dialogues become really poor and flashbacks silly. Funny it to see that descent acting also drops with it and becomes really poor and some of the (bad) characters become silly stereotypes.To top it in the end-game while all others are simply shot when they object, Arisu just gets beaten up but keeps getting back with more silly arguments and waits with his revelation of the ""murderer"" till the last moment while wasting time on a silly discussion.So the shows starts fascinating, but looses it more and more towards the end...but I guess it will appeal to teenagers...",5
"The acting was good just to long with a plot that gets old, not many likable characters in this series and I'm being kind with 6 stars.",6
"It's a bit of a common topic that every manga/anime adaptation into live action fails.. I mean none of them have been great so far... This is the best we've been given. For comparisons sake.. watch the first 5 minuets of the netflix 'deathnote' movie..Go have a shower for about 45 mins, take a lot of xanax to forget you saw those first 5 mins and then watch this series..Watch it in Japanses with subs, I didn't bother with the dub but it really was pulpy awesome scifi. Im a total cynic but I know when to turn my brain off and not pick apart things because the core of what I am watching is great.Normal score a solid 7/10 but giving higher because its a successful manga adaptation that isnt terrible",9
"Well... acting is a bit bland beside for supporting chracter, background story for each character is too short so that you cant feel why this character doing that.but, im watchin this series after finished the manga, so i know why this character doing something like that.my suggestion, DONT READ THE MANGA!!! you will know background story for this series, and quite plot twist.enjoy this series, after that... you can read the manga to know better!!MUST WATCH!!",9
"There are Series on Netflix that you have high hopes for or just seems good, but end up flat on their Faces when you finally watch it. On the other Hand, there are Series that you don't have a lot of expectations or know little about, but turn out to be a really big surprise.This is one of those Series, I literally knew nothing about it, I just tried it out and it turns out to be one of the best Series I have seen this Year. It is a Mystery-Action-Adventure-Thriller about a group of Friends who end up in a Place where they are forced to participate in Games that result in Life or Death.This Season the Series didn't really focus too much on the ""Why"" and ""How"" the People ended up where they are, it focused more on the Games themselves, and the Experiences, Group Dynamics and Background of the Participants.Each Game is unique and thus have to be solved in a relatively unique way also. The Pacing, Storytelling, Characterizations, Acting, etc. are all pretty good, there's not a lot of dull moments in the Episodes, there's always something interesting happening.It's just one of those Shows where, once you start watching, you just don't want to stop. Truly a Hidden Gem, it is a Japanese Production, not much Promotion, not much hype, hopefully it won't stay hidden for long. For Science Fiction Fans, this is a Must Watch for me, again one of the Best Series I have seen this Year.",10
This show was really good I can't wait for the second season it was crazy like what if this really happened in real life everyone should watch great show !!,10
"5 minutes just running, 3 minutes just thinking, 4 minutes just being quite and looking. Some of the games are fun others are just hide and seek with and without guns. MEH. It has potential just wish it wouldn't be so fxking slow. I skipped to the ending and you know.. it's kinda what you expect but nothing more. Season 2 - without me.",3
I cannot express how much I loved this show. Every episode kept you wanting to know what crazy twisted thing was going to happen next. We definitely need a second season. Great job netflix.,10
"Finally Netflix delivers an entertaining series in another language than english thats worth watching. This series is totally mindblowing, with an element of Escape room in a post-apocalyptic like parallel world. Its based on the Manga series by Taro Aso. And it does it quite good and stays true to the Manga. I highly recommend watching this. Only downside is, that there is only 8 episodes. Plot is nice and just like in the Manga, the main characters is stepping into what seems to be an empty festival, they are greeted by a woman who tells them that they have already ""entered their game"". After clearing the game, she reveals to them that, in Borderland, they must play games to survive. Very entertaining",10
"Perfect start and mediocre finish. The intro to Usagi was perfect. However, I feel like they rush this through. I think it needed more marinating. Have a character development, it's hard to like certain characters because it feels like you don't know them. I think great tv shows implement characters to a different standard. For example, Usagi would have been a great antidote to the mediocre performance from the protagonist. I think the mistake they made was rushing this. I like the tv show but it's not something I will say 'omg I can't wait to see season 2.' Unlike Arthdal Chronicles (Korean) which is a must see, I think it is one of the better Japanese survival tv shows out there but for Netflix standards they could have hit a home run but instead they hit a ground rule double on the first season. My honest opinion. My true rating is a 6/10 but I have it 8/10 because some of the low rating doesn't really makes sense.",8
"Lately I found myself fascinated with japanese culture and tv, so I knew this show was coming. It surprised me to see the publicity around it and after I watched the show, I understood the amount of money Netflix put in this. I loved the atmosphere, the music and the first 4 episodes. It really looks like another world, with the same buildings and spaces, but empty, on the verge of the survival, with clinical colours. I noticed most of the actors and after I finished the series, I looked for almost everyone of those who appeared in more than 2 episodes. Their acting is different from what we are used to in the western cinema- they are more expressive in sadness and desperation, to the point they may seem melodramatic. Maybe it's a way to compensate the restraint the japanese society usually shows. As I said, I liked most of the actors, especially Arisu's friends - Keita Machida (Karube), cool and lone ranger like, and Yuki Morinaga (Chota), sweet and full of fears, and their chemistry with Kento Yamazaki. As for Yamazaki, he has ups and downs. His scenes in the end of episode 3 are magnificent and memorable, they left me broken, I saw myself in his howls. Then he goes in the end of episode 8, the scene with all the people in the lobby, and something doesn't seem real, it's all rhetorical. In exchange, Tao Tsuchiya should be allowed to do more, talk more, not be just an idealized heroine.
Anyway, I hope they renew the series. It's easy to watch, with a subject that makes you think about it and most importantly, it's a tv show with a soul.",8
"I have never watched Anime/Manga, never been interested in them either but I LOVED the series! If you like puzzles, escape room, problem solving, you would love this series! Definitely recommended, hands down one of the best production that aired during Covid period",9
"Imawa No Kuni No Alice (Alice in borderland) is one of my favourite manga and when I found out that there was a live action I was happy and sad at the same time because I was afriad of them spoiling this masterpiece but guess what? They haven't!The show is amazing and is definitely one of the best series out there to watch. There are many different aspects from the manga which made it even more entertaining to see!Anyway, give Alice in Borderland a chance, you won't regret it! And also, if you enjoy reading comics, check out the manga, it's awesome!",10
"Absolutely superb, a stunningly beautiful well crafted story that's left me wanting more. One of the best shows I've seen this year",10
"Really enjoyed it up until the 10 of hearts game, 56 people enter the game, close to 50 people die during the 2 hours of mass murdering, and then there's 30 odd people still standing at the end.Ruined it for me because that's all I could think of during the last game... Would of given it 10/10 if they crunched a few numbers before airing the show",7
"I'm usually a bit skeptical with live action adaptation from mangas, but Alice in Borderland surpassed my expectations. I haven't read the manga, so I'm sure how faithful it is to the source material, but as it is on its own, it was brilliant! Sets the tone pretty much straight away, had me on the edge of my seat all the way. Really enjoyed the characters, thought the cast were great! Some really awesome action sequence, good twists and wtf moments. All I'll say it's like Battle Royale x Hunger Games x 28 Days Later. Don't wanna spoil it for you!
Hope you guys enjoy it as much as I did! Peace!",10
"I haven't watched many Japanese movies in the last 15 years or so. The commitment to such story arcs I fear may drive off some viewers, but in my opinion they are timed perfectly. The balance between the action and the intrigue doesn't have me reach for my phone to check my email. I look at that as a win since once you've seen enough western television you're more or less likely to feel a familiar rhythm.Now that I've finished this series I can't wait to see the next season.",9
Please make season 2. Even as a person who doesn't read the Manga this is interesting and thrilling to watch.,10
"Read the excellent reviews and decided to give this a go. Not disappointed, really well done. A bit of mix between CUBE and being inside a video game, but well executed and keeps you gripped. Well worth a watch.",9
"Despite the seemingly raving reviews no doubt written by people that would have simply just liked it cause it was japanese and based on a manga I have some faults. The series itself was not bad if you like this kind of battle royal style, genre of film than you will find it a decent watch however there are some faults the CGI is at times awful and there is a general feeling that this series relies more on shock value than it does substance. Which makes me worry about how great in the end it will be as a series we are continuously introduced to characters who we grow some sort of feeling for and then they are killed now don't get me wrong once maybe twice this can put the audience on edge and be thrilling but after a while and at the end of the series I feel like the people left I have no real connection to they seem to just be brought out the wood works with the bare minimum of character plot.",5
"Very nice but also brutal Sci-Fi serie.
It's like most Japanese shows very violent and sometimes a bit weird, but it never gets dull.Still has a lot of plotholes and not everything is explained but enough to make another season, too bad it has the potential to become repetitive if they milk it out too far.Give it a go next lockdown, you won't be disappointed",7
"Interesting premise, and enjoyable enough, but very rough around the edges. I haven't read the manga so I had no expectations or knowledge of the story or characters. It comes across as a mix of many other well known movies n TV themes. As the series goes on you see less and less of the the puzzles, which to me, was the best part. Lots of continuity/story holes.
Entertaining, but not one I'll be telling friends to watch. Good way to see some of Tokyo city without people and cars.*** oblique spoilers below ***... But that last few eps of S1. Urgh. It's like they gave up on intricate puzzles and any sense of solving anying, or even have the main characters do anything tricky or smart, or hell, even interesting. Just boring pointless violence, interspersed with jammed in flashbacks/backstory. Way too much was introduced with The Beach which seemed unnecessary, and with very little stakes to begin with, not much is gained or lost by all the dying. We still know next to nothing about the game, why they are there, etc.
I'm not even sure I really care to know after finishing S1...",6
"I found a lot to love about this - the Lost/Hunger Games/escape room premise is exciting and the show doesn't pull its punches. In the main the game solutions seemed a bit obvious but I guess the idea is that in the adrenaline and disorientation of the situation you wouldn't be thinking straight.
Where I dropped a couple of points was in the execution. Some of the performance in the dubbed to English version was distractingly bad - if I could speak Japanese and watch an undubbed version then it might be different but I can't so that was an issue for me.
It felt to me like it would have benefited from being a 12 or 13 episode series - I think with a bit more time and space we could have got to know the characters a bit better and the series end could have been better developed. The last episode felt a bit thrown together and left a lot to question - in a ""Whut?"" way, not in a cliff hanger way. Plus a minor, but distracting, quibble was that there seemed to be some confusion about how many people were at The Beach.
Those flaws are there and detracted from it a little but I'd still recommend it as an interesting and exciting show to watch and I'm now keen to check out the source material.",8
The storyline and everything it's just so well done. It really has you in suspense. I can't wait for season 2 !!!,10
"no spoil - I just finished the serie and it was awesome except for the last episode, i was hooked from episode 1 and I recommend this serie to anyone.Until the last episode... Everything was great, the plot was great, the actors were great but everything just went the japanese anime way : way too much useless & dramatic scenes lasting for hours without purpose and making me feel more than annoyed.
I was just feeling like ""come on! just get on with it""
I was so disappointed the serie had to finish this way because the 7 first episode were just amazing. Hope for a season 2!",7
This is one of those Japanese gems like a high end Lexus that's been knocked outta the park. The twists are NOT predictable and there is some very original content here! I like to savor shows one episode per day but I'm so tempted to binge!,10
"The premise of this series is one which I love so I was very intrigued to watch this series when I saw it pop-up on Netflix.If I had to give it a score after having watched the first 4 episode it would have been a 8/10 for me. However as my score clearly shows something went wrong after episode 4.Personally the second half is when I felt the series starting loosing what was great about the first 4 episodes. Not to go into any spoilers, but it introduces new elements to the story that could be interesting but just feels out-of-place in my opinion. I think it could be done and I don't think it was necessarily horrible, however this is where I started to feel that the story lost its focus.However the big problem with this series is the last 2 episodes. Especially the last one. Obviously since it's the end I can't go into too much detail but what I will say is that story becomes rather ridiculous. And this is something considering what the story really is from the beginning. But it goes from being more of a mystery and figuring out what is happening to just be full-blown action and craziness. Also the acting and dialog becomes very over the top. The big reveal that we get at the end is not really satisfying, it just left me disappointed and mad about the potential this series had.Still I wouldn't call this show bad, im still giving it a 6/10 since the first 4 episodes were great, ep5/6 was okay, and 7/8 was bad, which I average out to about a 6.If you are asking yourself if you should watch this show then I would say that if you like the concept and these types of shows then it's a good bingeable show for a weekend. Since it's only 8 episode it doesn't take too much time to watch it through. But if you aren't feeling it after the first episodes then you can stop since it won't get better from there.",6
It's the best thing on Netflix right now. Must watch and I am no manga or Japanese genre fan. A bit slow at the start but I guess narration does require some context unless u jump straight to action but it picks up after that and keeps u hooked till the end. I get why some didn't like the ending since everything until then was excitingly chaotic. But I can't complain and be more excited to watch the second season. Overall it's very entertaining.,9
"Narrative - great
Mystery - great
Story - greatCharacters - since this was originally a manga, the characters are written like anime characters
it's not a big problem, but it sometimes feel a little off, but this is just my personal opinion, except that, they are goodShould you watch it - definitly
unless you don't like gore, cause it got some but not too much",7
Just wow this show had me on the edge of my seat. Great show to watch!! Cant wait for season 2!!!,8
"I really wasn't expecting very much from this show, but it really amazed me. It got my brain thinking and had me trying to solve things throughout each episode. I felt so many different emotions from this show and I cannot wait for the next season. This show was carefully thought out and everything falls together beautifully. The visuals were also amazing along with the character development! I am very critical with what I watch, but this show was binge worthy. Amazing!",10
"I'm in love with this series .
I didn't expected it to turn out so good .
With kento awesome acting as usual , this series is 10/10 for me .
The main character and side character all have some kind of past and this game that they are made to play changes themselves , i love how main character uses his brain ( from playing too many games ) .
I wasn't available to predict what going to happen next , so it was fun watching this .",10
"Three best friends in Tokyo seem to vanish from thier own world and venture into an alternate reality of some kind, where the normally densly packed Tokyo is abandoned. A dream come true for some(especially during a pandemic), however, the trio soon realize that their existence has an imminent expiration date. All they need to do is play some games to extend their stay. The catch? The games can kill you of course, and there is a time limit(every games worst nightmare). Furthermore, if the games don't kill the loveable trio, then surely the other ""players"" might.Those lucky enough to stumble across ""Alice In Borderland"" will soon find themself very unlucky, when they have binged watched the entire season during one night and crave more episodes. Like other postmodern science fiction films/series such as ""The Matrix"" or ""Battle Royale"", this season brings an element of mystery and confussion that made me want to find out more, what the hell is really going on?Amidst all we get to see pleasing, well made action scenes that takes your mind of the bigger picture. At one point a sword-wielding mad man with face tattoos fights a bikini dressed teenager with drealocks in a club with strobelights(didn't think I would see that, like ever). Survival is of course key in Borderland first and foremost. The games are tricky enough put far from impossible.It's of course easier solving them in the safety of the couch and not betting ones actual life on solving the puzzle. Well written and exciting aspect of the first season.Characters are not fully fleshed out, but this is so far the first and only season. Then again, as you could imagined in this type of dystopian sandbox, people die left and right. With that said my favorite episode was episode 07, the one episode we actually got to see some brief backstory(and also the club fight). My favorite character is so far Usagi(Tao Tsuchiya). I call her ""Mirrors Edge girl"" for reason obivous if you look at her appearance and skills.In conclusion: Great pace, entertaining and fast action scenes. Captivating plot, can't wait for season 2 (please, oh please be a season 2). I really want to see what challenge a ""dressed card"" offers.",9
Outstanding is the acting of Yamazaki Kento in this series. The plot moves fast enough to not feel bored and the series theme and idea is unique. I like the survival theme and how interesting the series gets while unfolding. I hope we get to see a season 2!,10
I see the one in which the director and screenwriters made this show have that of an archetypal path.I loved its Hunger Games/Maze Runner type feel.The conplexity of the games to then have it looped it to mind games and personal character relationships was fascinating.Great watch - especially with friends.,8
Really impressed with the personality and development of each and every character. Happy with the interconnection of each character and their role in each episode. Masterfully tied past with present and set up the settings for each game. Ready for season two!,6
Very interestingly built up a game and the concept of the story.,10
"Really hope there is a season 2!I love being transported to a different world and Alice is a convincing one too. The acting is great and the camera work is great too. The story is silly but it's also awesome too! If you roll with it, it's a enjoyable ride! The dialogue can be a bit over the top but that's part of manga.
You won't be disappointed with investing your time in this",8
"After Game of thrones I did not found my self breathless like this series
It is excellent work",9
I didn't think I would enjoy this show so much but I most definitely loved it I hope there will be more seasons.,9
This is crazy good. recommend it to anyone who can deal with reading subtitles.,9
"Nice idea, but the lousy dialogue and cringeworthy acting finally made me stop. I normally really like Japanese productions, but this was just bad and possibly the most overrated show in a while. Hopefully the rating will balance itself once more realistic ratings come in to counteract all the 10 clickers.So seriously don't waste your time.",2
"It's been so much fun in watching the series. Initially I found the series repulsive due to cultural conflict. Then I gradually liked it and started binge watching it after episode 2. Yes, they put too much emphasis on the details of corpse SFX, but that's not a big deal.To me the plot is quite a simple one. The true calling is the concept of coma-in-multiverse. I have to keep thinking and watching and enjoying the thriller at the same time. That's the fun: a 3-in-1 kind of fun.I seldom watching Japanese drama and that's one that I would recommend to my friends.",8
"Before it was released, I had been looking forward. However, after I finished 4 Eps, I didn't think it fulfilled my expectation.
Some people's deaths are unnecessarily. The game in Ep 3 is a little boring. It is not interesting, without unexpected turns. It seems that this game is only aimed to kill his two friends and provide him a chance to meet the heroine. However, I don't know why the heroine can survive so long either, as it proves that she is just lucky enough after I finished Ep 4.
But it is still worth watching if you are a fan of thrilling and suspenseful dramas.",7
Just now finished watching the series on Netflix and cant get over it. Desperately want a season 2 .Mostly I was star struck by dori sakurada's character as Niragi. At first I couldn't even recognize him. He was so good at acting. My God ??,10
"You can tell that this series is based on a manga. It is extremely exaggerated - unfortunately that also applies to clichés and nonsense. In addition, ""Alice in Borderlan"" unfortunately hardly offers any twists or storylines that are not completely predictable or one-dimensional. Unfortunately, from the first to the last second, the whole thing is an unorginal, illogical and often stupid mess that has not worked with comparable formats such as Qube.",4
I have never been a fan of Anime . However I love Castlevenia and Blood of Zeus . I was really excited for this show because of its extremely unique plot . It didn't not disappoint . Let's start with the positives . - The acting is really good from every single cast member . - The character development is excellent . - The action scenes are thrilling . - The gore is used right although I wanted a bit more . - The show is extremely addictiveThe ending is great as well . Now the negatives . - The dialogue is bad . - The show in the middle gets a bit boring . - Some CGI effects are bad . So this show is addictive and I really need season 2 now,8
"I was inspired by the good user rating, it also started quite well when the actors were suddenly all alone. But already at the end of the first episode you could tell the amateur actors. It got worse and worse from one episode to the next, so from the 3rd episode on I didn't feel like it anymore.",2
"The two first episodes is pretty good but then..... Did the writers and directos die after episode two?
To many issues with this tv serie so don't watch it.",1
"Alice in Borderland is a story about people being thrown into death games and they obviously try to survive. The concept is not very original and also has been seen in quite a few anime shows as well.Depending on how it is done it can either be pretty entertaining or very dull. When you know that a lot of character may or will die then it often is difficult to build any attachment to them because they might be gone in the next episode.So far in season one the show has done a decent job at least regarding the main characters - one of them being Arisu. By the end of the first season I did somewhat care about him and want him to survive. Usagi as a character is also very likable.Unfortunately for the side characters it's a lot of hit and misses - so resembles a bit of a rollercoaster. Some are decent/good and some you'll forget within the next 10 seconds.The games that are shown are interesting for the most part. Some of them could use better twists though.My biggest gripe is the ""power"" inconsistency though. We're having characters that for example supposedly have been bullied in school because of how weak they were and that don't look physically strong and then suddenly they pull off something completely inhuman like doing a backhand fist slap and through that throwing another character several meter away from them.Also the show tries to provide backstories for the various bad characters to explain why they are the way they are. However it's hard to feel sympathy for someone being punched in the face when said person a minute earlier randomly murdered people and has a great time with that.I'd like to see where the story goes in season 2 and hope they can fix certain problems. Overall it's okay to watch it once. Most probably won't return to re-watch it later though.",6
"Not many show has made me cry after 3 episode. This show is raw, brutal and exciting! If you like things like saw, escape room and the walking dead, then you will like this! Highest recommends everyone to watch this show!",10
"I think the fact that I hated it so much is because I'm not used to the Japanese acting style. It's so over the top all the time. If you're not into anime you might hate it as well. The script is full of cringe and the screaming is so annoying. Almost unbearable. Good effects, but that's it. I really don't understand the rating to be honest.",2
"First of all...we have to remember this is an adaptation to a manga/anime. They respect a Tv Show format mixing some of it with the classic anime character development, background and plot twist style. If you're into Japanese style tv shows and like Japans culture this will be perfect for you. If you're new into Japanese format I'll first recommend watching at least some classic anime films, shows or even reading some manga so you can understand the concept overall and the Japanese industry. This show is full of excitement, nerve wracking moments and even emotionally/heartbreaking moments. A 10/10 and hopefully they release a second season!!! Give this show a chance and enjoy it.",10
MADE IT THROUGH 3 EPISODES SO FAR AND ITS STARTING TO PICK BUT MAN I FEEL SO SORRY FOR OUR MAIN CHARACTER AND I STILL HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS I HOPE TO BE ANSWERED LIKE WHAT CAUSED ALL THIS AND WHERE IS EVERYBODY ELSE,8
"This is just one insanely dark series! Great storyline, believable actors, and a series that will twist you mind and keep you very captivated throughout the season. I totally recommend it!",9
"A thrilling suspense ride through deserted Tokyo streets, featuring engaging character drama, moral dilemmas and impressive set-pieces. Reminiscent of the Hunger Games, in a good way.",8
"Most addictive show I've watched all year. Absolutely need season 2 ASAP! Never seen the manga, but i've read they have sticked to it. As long as season 2 super good and they give us a gooood ending -> it has to be one of the best series ever. please, please season 2!!!",10
"I Love the TV series with short episode. The appearance of every character in the movie will not easy to determine of what will happen every episode. I love the series the writer to aid with every character, especially the main character of the movie.
A couple of thumbs up.",8
"The people in this show act like manga characters, it doesn't work with real people. Too many clichés, one example is games being solved at the last possible second. A guy punches a tiger and somehow is the winner in that exchange.",4
Dare you watch the first chapter!! You will enjoy the empty citiy of Tokyo with a lot of surprises!,9
"Loved it so much i always like this type of movies and when it comes to Series
it was a big joy for me, well made
can't wait for S02",10
"A very nice series that keeps you alert almost all the time. There were two episodes a bit ""lower"" compared to the others. The only reason that I rated it with 9 and not 10 is that it still does not explain two important questions. How did all these people were ""transfered"" to that world and how this technology of lasers and so on was found and by whom. Hoping these questions will be answered in Season 2. If yes, then my review will be changed to 10!",9
This story looks like it was written by a 10 year old. A bunch of game stuff heaped on with little to no point. Might appeal to young virgin gamers but certainly not for adults.,3
An AMAZING concept but really bad executed. Half way in the story everything turned into something confusing and even boring. To me there were bad decisitions made.,7
"Japan did it this tv show is so good i dont even know where to start a must watch for everyone if only there was more shows like this concept, story, action, characters everything is perfect a solid 10 !",10
I never thought a live action movie based on animes/manges would be so good. the cast was insane. I really enjoyed all the characters in the Series. Please more live action movies like that......... I wish Death Note Live action was like this.,9
I started watching after some reviews must say 3 episodes are really good and absolute thrill to watch if you are gamer it's for you. This series lost its thrill after 3rd episodes it becomes too slow in narrative (except few moments).,6
"The plot of the show is very similar to Saw series except this is not created to punish the wrong doers. It's a game of life and death among humanity. Those games are almost insane (imagine if you were one of them!) driving them to make swift decision and the right decision to survive (to win). It's really a game of wits mostly, you need to be calm and have great observations to help you through every stage.Every character seems so suspicious and you really don't have a clue who is going to betray you. You're constantly at the crossroad, trying to decipher the game and it's exhilarating for viewers in my opinion.It's insatiable watching the episodes. You yearned for more, because we are looking forward to seeing the truth behind these games. And to get answers to what happened to these people? Who created them? And most importantly what's the ending?The only reason why I didn't give it a 10 is simply because it's rated R21 but I think the gore and the explicit content isn't suffice. A little nude scene will also add some flavors to the series.",9
"I had some reservations about the series as I have never seen a Japanese TV series before. The idea is so original and well-written. It's exciting, intense, and interesting. A group of misfits are transported to a parallel universe where you have to play to survive. The whole world is a play stage. Time to binge now.",9
Fantasy...flying girls and so on....nothing for adults...,6
"I love animes and mangas but i hate bad adaptations. I don't understand why, when they make these series they are forcing themselves to copy %100 to look like a manga character. Their movements and mimics can't be same exactly like the drawings and yet they try to act like that and it makes everything cringey. If you like the story try reading the manga it is much better.",5
I think at first you will see that it will be ok to watch but as you go than you will feel damn this way much better than what I expected and the third episode made me crythat third episode I will never forgetJapan is producing some best content not only in anime now I know,10
"I was very pleasantly surprised by this new show that's once you get through the first episode which I watched a dubbed version that also had subtitles which was funny as a lot of what was said was not what the subtitles said!
I found the first episode a little strange and slow but then it is Japanese and so culturally different the3 friends appeared quite childish as in immature in first episode. However the show picks up from 2 nd episode and I found it better to watch with subtitles and not dubbed
The concept is different which makes it an unique show and gripping as I binge watched all 8 episodes
Looking forward to next series I think this will get a lot of positive reviews and be nominated for awards so am confident there will be a season 2",9
"The quality of this show puts Hollywood etc to shame! Feels like a live action anime more than any other manga adaptation i have seen before. I know it is based on a manga of the same name but it massively feels like a cross between Gantz and Death Parade which is just a dream come true!The cyber punkesque vibe and music really beef up the atmosphere and actually help make you feel afraid of this city. I went into this not knowing anything about it and hadn't heard of the Manga, it has now made a fan of me and will be treating myself to the manga books at Christmas =)Really hope we get at least another season minimum as this is now one of my favorite shows.",10
"It started very well, I like characters, scenes, games and I really wondered what will happen next but when they arrived to beach, everything started to get worse.. And in last episode, it turned kind of hunger games.. Generally it is ok, watchable and different but it finished with lots of questions..it looks it will be second season and I hope we can get the answers.",8
"Love the show .... great preformed from all the actors
Hope season 2 is coming soon",10
"Some small nice elements and ideas !!!!
But Man oh man..... Way too much crying and weeping at the start, unbearable !!!
Watch CUBE .....much better !",3
"Started off just OK despite the insanely over the top acting, which the Japanese are known for, and the sometimes hilarious English dubbing.. After episode 2 everything went downhill fast.. The hilarity of the dubbing only takes it so far.. With episode 3 I'm out...",3
"Where everything had started was pretty catchy to be honest, but everything loses its reality with each episode. I did not like the acting that much and some of the dialogs made me laugh due to nonsense.",5
"The show is bad from any point of view: casting, total overacting by everyone (maybe this is ok for Japanese acting school but it was really hard to watch what's going on the screen), lack of logic in heroes behavior and script at all. The first time when I regret the time I spend for the show.",1
I can't say much without ruining it but I'm on episode 3 and each episode gets better and better those who have seen episode 3 will know exactly what part made me leave this review,9
"Absolutely mesmerized by this! The story, the cast, each episode has something that will just keep you coming back for more!
I have not seen anything like it !",10
"This is a brilliant show that feels like a true live-action adaptation of an anime. Pacing is great, characters are well-developed, action and CGI is top-notch. Anyone bashing this show is either not into Japanese shows or just jumping on the hate bandwagon. You wanna know why people rate this so highly? Because it is actually that good. Don't listen to miserable people who can't appreciate quality television.",10
"Would I recommend? Hell yes. Well yeah this series contains genres and concepts already being done before but guess what? It's entertaining. Though they left the series on a Cliffhanger which is why this isn't a 10. I left the 1 star just in case for the next season. Honestly speaking this was an manga adaptation done right, the budget was definitely good and the cast, directing and everything was smooth. Okay now onto the most criticised part ""The story/plot holes"". Okay so there might've been few mistakes near the end but you gotta understand this stuff is Fiction. I didn't even recognise those plot holes until some yall point it out so Don't hesitate to watch this! For something that ain't even affect the characters. Love how It gets better each episode! Personally I prefer this much better than Sweet Home adaptation.",10
"For the begining i would Like to point out that as a beginner in Japanese TV it took half of the show to adapt to some of the specific aspects of their TV. A lot of the acting scenes were in my taste, way over the top and way to melodramatic. Specialy Arice on the end of EP 03. It took me apart from the show and I couldn't enjoy the scenes completely. Maybe it is because I am not used to Japanese TV culture and I know this is a adaptation from manga but scenes like that were constantly annoying to me. The acting was in some scenes Superb, but in the others it was absolutly terrible. It was laughable for me. There is a scene in which Arice explains the diesel fuel and the old motorcycle, and while he explains it, his hands look like he is holding an invisible potato or smth. Absolutly cringe ! You can say that the reason I think that is because I don't understand Japanese culture but I am not the only one saying this. On the other hand, there is plenty to like in this show, hence for my rating. Lets start with the obvious. The music was perfectly toned in my humble opinion and it set up the scenes very well. And I am no expert on music in TV shows but I tend to keep a simple rule. If you don't notice the music that much, that means its good. When I would notice a song in this show, it would be even better. I think everyone can agree on this one Secondly, the camera work was absolutly amazing. So many Great shots of nature, empty city, parks and even regular scenes from specific angles. And I am also amazed with the special effects here. They were much better than I expected before watching. To even think how much they spent on production. Impressive for sure. There is only few scenes where I noticed realy bad CGI, and the most memorable one was the sword-tiger fight in one of the games.
As i am mentioning swords, I remember the fight scene in EP 07 in the disco, if you are not planing to watch the show, at least watch that scene, it is a great, beautifuly filmed short action sequence.
Furthermore, the wrinting is also pretty good. The plot develops consistently through the episodes and it keeps you focused most of the time. Apart from the stuff I mentioned earlier, I realy respect the bold moves and twists the directiors make in the show (EP 03 is the best example). They realy wanted to show us that this is not a fairy tale world where everything ends well, but a serious place with serious consequences. Unlike the fairy tale, the Wolf can sometime win in this world.
And that brings us to games. Winning, playing, living, dying.
That was the main reason I started watching the show, and boy was I not dissapointed. From the first episode, to the last one, games are the main plot of the show. They involve your mind, your body, and your soul(heart). Some of them are easier than others but as a viewer, none of them are cliche easy answer games. Only the quick witted players such as Arice and Chershire (my absolute favourite) can break a hard game, and as a viewer you get the same chance. Visual clues are everywhere but they are not easy to spot in the first viewing. Sometimes I felt like i know all the answers but my theories turned out wrong, but on the other hand, some of my predictions of the plot turned out pin point accurate( I am not mentioning theories im which I failed miserably) .But in the end, when the game is done, the answer usualy feels obvious, but it really requiers a lot of skill. It makes you think, wwId? (what would Lucifer do? Nevermind, only Lucifans will get that joke). But no, seriously it makes you think ""what would I do?"". And the real answer is generaly: i don't know!. It is hard to think and act when your life is on the line, and your friends life too. Those kind of choices and games are this shows main attraction. IT shows you that nothing is black and white and sooner or later everyone gets in the grey zone of moral and ethic, but question is how are you gonna cope with that? Arise seeks revenge, not sure that he will get it any time soon, but let's wait for season 2.
I reccomend !

"This is like a cartoon written for 12 year olds adapted for live action. I'm sitting here on episode three watching supposedly emotional friends' memories of triple riding a bike through Tokyo, which is cringe at any age and in any script. But these dudes are old enough to sit in a bar and drink beer, which is literally the next scene. This just follows on a long list of Japanese culture stunting the growth of its youth. Is it a wonder that none of them ever date or get married anymore? They're all thinking of riding bikes with their friends at 22 years old? Oof it's just too much. Battle Royale is enjoyable corny with ultraviolence. For this, the violence is much less ultra and waaaayyy more corny. I don't recommend for anyone over 14, seriously. You'll be disappointed in the terrible script like it was written for a high school drama project.",3
"Not going to give it away let's just say best interpretation of alice in wonderland I've ever seen!! The characters are all phenomenal. the story line and plot is flawless and the execution of this intense suspense thriller is big budget big time quality I also love the filming in Tokyo. Trust me watch this right now!!! You'll binge it like we did..... 10 solid stars!!!!!!!!! Much respect to the writers director cast and crew, thank you!!!",10
"The show in itself is good. It has good acting, scenario and all else but the story between the games does not make sense. They are in middle of Tokyo with a ton of canned food in every convenience store , there is empty houses all alround them and yet they are camping and hunt for food? Else for minor characters no one bother to bring a weapon when going to game, they make little to no preparation.",6
"After The Queen's Gambit, this is the only series I finished in one sitting. Gosh everything was just so amazing, the storyline, the cinematography, the actors they're doing amazing job. Thank God Netflix for producing this series, I can't wait for season 2 and how the story will going to be, lot of questions remain unanswered. Hopefully in season 2 we'll find out every thing. MUST WATCH.",10
"These series made me watch all 8 episodes in one day , the moment first episode started i found myself immersed in it and with every challenge the protagonists go through you will feel that's it's you who is taking the challenge.
anyway it's not perfect show as there are some flaws espcially for CGI however that won't affect the whole expereince.",8
"Like a trash version of the cube, not sure if it's a cultural difference or a bad translation but it lacks any redeeming qualities, poor acting, effects, characters, script, plot and cinematography. Maybe enjoyable if you're a 12 year old or drunk and enjoy so bad it's good, otherwise give it a hard pass.",2
I VE NEVER SEEN SUCH AN INTERESTING SEASON . IT HOOKS YOU UP FROM START TILL THE END HIGHLY RECOMMENDED,10
"The theme is unique. The story is well developed, well explained and not repetitive . For a tv series , that alone is the most important. Aside from that, acting is on point. Music is ok. But the movie effects and how they created a completely humanless setting wowed me. A really good thriller series.",9
"Well planned..directed series.This one is a very good example of how action-manga should be portrayed.Even though the concept is unrealistic and has very little probability of actually happening in the real world,this series really makes us wonder if this could actually happen and makes us question our abilites and what we would do.Definetely a MUST watch.Makes you sit tight and watch the whole thing in one go.Hopefully there's a season 2.",9
The actors were bad. The script was full of plot holes. The characters behaved in a frustratingly nonsensical way. The budget was low. It was bad.,1
"So I got suckered in by the good rating. Read the reviews and you'll see there's a lot of people giving it 10 after watching 1 episode and saying proudly that they are doing that. Why do these dopes exist?
The 1st 2 episodes are good then it just goes down hill.
As it states it's a Netflix Original, so of course there's now an obligatory Trans person that also of course has to be a hero. I can guarantee you that's not in the original Anime.
But overall it's just boring.
Made up unimportant drama after the 1st 2 episodes give you 6 episodes of boring filler.
Don't waste your time.",1
"The first five episodes were decent. Some 'unnatural' parts were tolerable by keeping in mind this was originally a graphic novel.The final three episodes were painful to go though and were terrible. The flaws include: actions that are not believable, flashbacks or scenes that are being repeated in the exact way, unnecessary flashbacks (for minor characters), unnecessary fight scenes (between minor characters).The quality of the final three episodes made me drop two stars from what I would have rated the series based on the first five episodes. Overall, the story contains a lot of murder, is not very deep or inspiring, and is not a must watch.Maybe you can watch only the first five episodes, but the story does make you curious what happens next.To give you an idea of my taste: some of the TV series or movies that I love are 'The OA', 'Sense8', 'Beastars', 'Dark', 'Arrival', and 'Interstellar'.",6
"This movie might be more for the gamer, manga, younger crowd if you want to stay glued for all episodes. I am with rdvljunk, and started losing patience and rolling my eyes with the beach activities. Plenty of beautiful Japanese women for those who appreciate that.",5
"Excellent, big Thanks authors and actors who have been working on the serial",10
"Karube died too early!!! I'm so touched by the friendship of the three, Karube only died so that Alice would take the survival game seriously? Karube can be more useful if he's saved for later, at least wait till episode 6...",9
"I love this show! I've been watching it all day long, I would totally recommend it and I'm hoping there will be a season 2 because it was that great!",10
"The series felt like a justification for otakus who thinks one day they'll save the world with their gamer power.Still it was a pretty fun watch, if you can bare the overly edgy characters, ridiculous plots, and a story that makes wtf sense.",4
This was a fast paced story that will hold your interest. You really care about the lead characters. Excellent dark storyline with interesting characters. I hope this gets a second season because it is a great binge! Watch and enjoy.,10
"I'm glad I gave this a shot, it's such a great concept. I loved every game they played. I watched this all in one day and I'm going to watch it again with my girlfriend this time on the weekend!",10
"Typical japanese production: overacting, silly overeaction, useless info dump, lame scientific explainations, illogical world building that can never work, mystery box writing, over sexualisation in the worst possible situations, women as props and men as dickheads, typical villians and heros, lame twists, mindless violence...all the worst traits of a typical japanese show, you will find it here. Only people new to the Battle Royale genere, or those who have never read any manga will enjoy this.",1
It started off good and the idea behind it is somewhat interesting but the show gets boring really fast. Aside from bunch of cute teenagers running around which should attract people in the same age category this show really has nothing else to offer. I really don't get all the high ratings ....,2
Don't miss this amazing webseries it is really very amazing webseries. Can't wait for season 2,8
There are only few really good japan series to watch but this one might be a breakthrough for japan movie industries,10
"Its like a very good anime transformed into a real life
I cant wait for the next season",10
"The series which is redone from the Same named Anime shows that Animes can be redone as a none animated Series. After Death Note was such a bad remake, Alice in boarderland surpasses all expectations that an Anime Fan could have. The Story itsself goes beyond the Anime and doesnt Leave the viewer behind. It hab's high chances of giving you a Short Night with their really interesting content which is Build by a Game every episode while the mainstory keeps on going, so that there is no Filler.
The whole Series was an unexpected Highlight during corona and leaves the viewer with just searching when the 2nd season is about to Start.
For me a 9/10!",9
As always with Japanese inspired manga and anime it's high concept that is sort of out the box or interesting which then gets worse as the series goes on . Much like Japan sinks 2020 they have a good start that inspires curiosity. As it gets further in the dialogue and decisions fall off to the ridiculous. E.g and office worker who will stop at nothing to survive but despite knowing what she must do opts to wear heels for games she might have to run in.. ok . But back to the rest the strange cult idea could be plausible but would people really act how they are or have the food to do it. Just odd decision making as usual. Much like the way sword art online goes from thriller esk scenario to odd plot lines that shouldn't have been there . Sadly I know they just keep producing this stuff,6
"This show starts good enough, intriguing, it leaves you hanging for what is to come. This is for the first two episodes, after that you can see clearly it lacks depth, characters are weak, they are not likeable. The series was based on a manga and there are moments where it feels like you're watching some kind of budget anime with real people. Flashbacks to some characters lives that bring nothing new to the table there is absolutely no reason for them to be shown. Special effects lack quality at times, and the show gets dull and you feel like there is nothing they can do anymore to save it at some point. It ends aiming at a second season but I feel like I had enough with this one.",5
It's a one of a kind. I loved it from beginning to end.,9
"This is a fun filled Christmas melodrama with gratuitous drama, crazed plot and over the top, did I say over the top, acting and melodrama. Every line delivered is soooo way over the top that it is hysterical.The femme-androgynous cast is good to look at and the action fun.
Don't look for logic or reason.Escapist entertainment.",6
"Arisu Ryohei is unemployed and spends most of his time playing video games. One day he meets up with two friends in the middle of Tokyo. After some mild hijinks they hide in a cubicle in a public lavatory... suddenly the lights go out and they can no longer hear the general hubbub of the busy city. They emerge to find the city empty. Not long afterwards signs lead them to a building, where they are joined by two girls. Here they are forced to play a deadly game, after which they are awarded a playing card. It emerges that they will be forced to take place in such games on a regular basis. Later we are introduced to Usagi, a skilled climber, who later joins up with Usagi. They gradually learn more about the games and what the cards signify while trying to discover if there is a way back to their previous lives.I really enjoyed this series; little time is wasted with set-up; the viewers are thrown into the action along with our protagonists. We know as little about the world they are in as they do and only learn more as they do. Early games make it clear just how dangerous this world is; just because a character is introduced early does not guarantee their survival. The scenes within the games are very tense, and frequently quite gory; there is also a fair amount of fan-service as characters wear beachwear in later episodes for reasons explained in the series. The way the dynamic between the characters changes is interesting; especially after our surviving protagonists find a location with many more players. The cast, both main and secondary does a solid job making the fantastical situation believable. The effects are mostly good but a couple of times the CGI is a bit obvious. As the final episode ends many questions are answered but more are raised; these people's problems clearly aren't over... hopefully there will be at least one more season.These comments are based on watching the series in Japanese with English subtitles.",8
It's entertaining with good character development.,7
"Alice in Borderland (2020)
Alice in Borderland is a survival game live action series which is amazingly done. A common topic that every manga/anime adaptation into live action fails. I mean none of them have been grate so far... This is the best wr've been given.
So many different things to look forward in each episode with unexpected twists.
Binge watched the whole season.
Highly recommended for manga/anime lovers out there.
#Netflix",7
"This started off great but each episode just takes ages to get into it so I've knocked off 1 point, but it is brilliant so far and I'm up to the 'distance' episode.",8
"A lot of people die and at some point it gets to be so often that it is repugnant. But that's the whole point of the show. And the kid, Chota cries every ten seconds. His voice is also kinda annoying. And I was kinda happy he got the boot. Those are my gripes. Other than that it's interesting and probably a better manga adaptation than most.",7
"It starts with a really interesting plot and also the characters are intriguing. The Japanese way of story telling is appealing although from a western perspective one is not used to it. Also the side topic of gender roles is fitting into it.Having said that the show delivers spectacular bad twists, character developments and acting. It's so weird to watch and painful but I really wanted to see the end of the show.Unforgettable the ridiculous fight against that cougar, the march back with bike all in the same time, the main characters always thoughtful games whereas others fight animals, the incapability of just killing this Aguni and so on... it's just so bad.Why did the girl revealed that she was the dealer? How did that help anybody? And then she died. Great job. And what about those cards. Where were they coming from and did they actually needed the cards? And why is everyone young and the girls always in bikinis?",5
"This just came up in my Netflix queue as a recommended show to watch. It's a killer show. Lots of action, drama, and terrific musical score. While I am not really into manga I could see how this could easily translate into a movie storyboard. What I loved about the show is that each main character has a backstory that is often touching. The ending has a nice twist and hopefully, there will be a Season 2 - as we leave Arisu and his girlfriend Usagi poised to face more challenge in this hellish dystopian world. Seriously I fell in love with this nail-biting drama and I highly recommend it.",10
"Japan can make good series too.
Waiting for season 2",10
"This series started quite well. Although not very original, the premise is intriguing and it kept me watching and enjoying for the first 3 episodes. After that apparently, a 10 years old boy took over the script and the episodes became ridiculous...Some big flaws in the final episodes: 1) Arisu could have never joined the final game since he did not register in time 2) We hear that there are 58 participants for the final game when we see hundreds of people on the beach 3) Arisu gets kicked and punched all the time but somehow the brutal guys kill everybody but never manage to kill him at the beach",6
"This series was definitely overrated. Speaking of the scenes, fine, it looks high-budget effects especially the killing scenes. HOWEVER, those games are totally not making sense as a brainstorming series and it seems like only the main character count come up with a unique and no rule-related solutions. Good to emphasize their friendship but if it's nothing to do with the game, DON'T even waste time digging that deep. Generally the speed was too slow.",5
A very entertaining and fun to watch TV show and a good example of a well-done live action show. The atmosphere feels close to the manga and there are some interesting turn of events. Looking forward to season 2,8
"I just watch the entire tv show!
Full of good ideas, close to the movie CUBE and evolve on his own way very fast.I do not know who are the writers of this tv show, BRAVO !A very serious, dark, well filmed / acted tv show, you absolutely need to know.
Netflix just renew for a season II yesterday ""very good news""!",9
"...as they deserve to get my conribution.Honestly, one of the shows i couldn't finish to bingewatch, they better outdo themselves with season 2 and give Battle Royale a run for its money ;).
A well deserved 8/10 so far.",8
"Loved this. Fun, action packed and totally entertaining.
I really like this kind of concept, which was first explored in the Cube Trilogy of movies.
This looks like a really fun ride so far.",10
"The first two episodes were fine. They can grap your attention. However, the rest is really confusing. They did not explain how they ended in this world and why they play the games.
The first 4-5 episodes were boring. You only watch people playing games. And then the catastrophy was the beach part. Really very bad. This is a great example of bad writing. The beach idea is really desperate.
The characters are not likeable and you can feel they are not real. The director insisting over and over that people are willing to sacrifice thier life for others are not real and become annoying.",4
"Japan seems to like the game theme, and "" Alice in Borderland "" nailed every aspect of it. From the suspense to the gore, the drama had it all. Fortunately, that all didn't include romance, at least not yet.Having not read the manga, and watching the drama with no prior experience of the Alice in Borderland universe, it wasn't hard to get introduced to the story and smoothly enter the gaming mode. The drama does a great job introducing each character and their background stories, blending them well with the main mystery about who's behind everything and the individual games the players were asks to play. The extra plotline with the 'Beach' and the strategies that the characters were ploting was another suspenseful factor that added a lot to the main entertainment of the drama.As for the performances, everyone did a great job with their characters and were enjoyable to watch. Some of the actors were acutally unrecognizable!Finally, the CGI were spot on and didn't ruin the whole experience.So, overall, 9 out of 10.",9
"After watching this show, I said to myself ""this feels like watching an anime"". And lo and behold, I found out later it was actually based on a manga/anime series. Honestly, I thought the show started out really strong but got a bit meh by the end. The first few episodes have a really nice atmosphere and sense of not knowing what the heck is going on, but by the end so many characters are introduced and secrets are revealed that it's just like ""oh, ok"". It also has all the typical cliche characters you are used to seeing in every anime ever, like the dorky but smart kid, the eccentric party guy, the sadistic goth lolita chick, and sadistic right-hand killer dude, you get the idea. Still not a bad watch.",7
"The first two episodes are kind of worth it. After that, it just feels lackluster, not so entertaining, and attention-grabbing. The backstories of the characters are not always that necessary and sometimes even cut scenes that are of interest, looks like a collage. As it progresses it loses more and more, it becomes a violent battle between the rational and the irrational, totally expectable. The conclusions at which the main character reaches are also not so perceptive and well explained as in the beginning, it becomes more about humans than about the game. That's why in my opinion, is not some groundbreaking work. Mainly because it can be compared with so many other great works with a similar dystopian story that are so much better.",6
"I've never read the manga so I can't compare that to this, but THIS was an amazing show. This concept was unlike any other show I've watched before. I loved many of the characters and how they use their individual strengths while playing the games. This was also my first Japanese drama and I was not disappointed. Overall, a thrilling drama that I easily watched in two days.",9
"Loved it. Def recommended. Once you past a bit over-dramatic acting (usual for japanese cinematography), you will find that games are incredibly interesting and witty, there are some super-cool characters and visuals are great. Series will keep your attention all the way. Cant wait for the season 2.",10
"Wow I like it so much I finished on two days
First it's anew idea and a lot of crazy deadly games
I well wait for the second episodes I hope it well be great like the first one with new idea
Actors are good after I saw this one sure I well looking for new Japanese sires
Thanks",9
"I went through this series very quickly, and totally enjoyed it. Like others have pointed out, it is a quirky series.",8
"Okay the ten star ratings are a joke, the series itself wasn't bad but it had a lot of good and bad points.
Episode's 1 & 2 were really good.
Episode's 3 & 4 were slow and I nearly turned the series off.
Episode's 5 & 6 again were really good.
Episode's 7 & 8 were disappointing.
So really a series of hits and misses, I am glad it was only for 8 episodes otherwise it would have dragged on and on.
The cgi was laughable as we're some of the scenes such as the bus scene.
As for the scantily clad girls, have a meal.",5
"This is a completely different genre for me so I'm going to give it justice. The first two episodes started off reall strong. However, I skipped all the middle episodes to see how the games were played out. Honestly I wasn't that interest in the backdrop of all the characters though some of them added to the story line.There are several questions still unanswered for me. Why did all the people disappear? We're they transported to a different reality? It seems so.I didn't follow the logic of the last episode, I couldn't genuinely believe that a person would want to kill everyone because their friend died.Looking forward to the next season but it really has to build on the world building element of this dystopia to keep it interesting and I think the show could tailor more to international audiences.From a cinematography perspective I loved the blueish look and feel at the start and some of the rooftop blue sky shots. However, they also experimented with the orange tinge as well which was nice to view - the cast is primarily East Asian so the colour grading was adapted to bring out the skin tones.I think the show also had lots of subliminal themes eg several plots focussed on suicide, female characters had nurturing roles etc.This was a unique show, it's brought this genre to the mainstream Netflix viewers and we'll have to adapt to this different kind of story telling.",8
"Because those who rated this series 10/10 have only watched the first two or three episodes. Honestly, this would have been far better off if it had ended after the third episode, with Arisu heading into the unknown. It's almost like they hired a completely different scriptwriter for episodes 4-8.Seriously, save yourself 5 episodes' worth of time and don't watch beyond episode 3.3/10 for the first three episodes, and I'm being very generous for the third...",3
"The idea is great. The writing was reasonable to some extents.
My mains two issues:
1- They could use a better actor for the main character - I felt the overacting with his screams. He didn't touch my feelings at all.
2- A lot of useless flashbacks in the last few episodes for minor characters which bored me.",8
"It starts very well with the first three episodes, but then it gets more and more stupid.
5/10 only",1
Highly recommended!!! You're missing the best show if you haven't watch this yet. They did an excellent job for making this. Waiting for the next season.,10
A really great idea that suffers from overly long scenes of monologuing and silence without purpose. There were plot holes and characters solving puzzles by connecting dots that made little sense. For the budget could have been great but as is was just decent.,4
"This is a great show, original with a good cast . each episode gets you in . the actors fit the show greatly and the production is good. Up there as one of the best series in 2020",8
"Expecting some exciting mystical stories in the ultra-modern backdrop from the Land of the Rising Sun, I did not expect this to be just another series of the old but well known Japanese torture game show. The only difference being now equipped with smartphones and hi-tech gadgets. The fact that the people in the show aren't really tortured like they were in the reality shows, a lack of logic or any coherent plot line, are the reasons it failed to hold my attention beyond 3 episodes. So it was an early sayonara for me.",1
This movie plays with your emotions and does it so well. The story line had me hooked. I feel the 3rd episode was the best and so sad when Arisu's friends died :'(,9
If you desire to switch your brain off from this miserable time we are having at the moment then this série is for you.,8
I couldn't stop watching it haven't had a show grip me like this in a while. I'm sad it's over. It was kinda like hunger games on steroids. Really good,8
"I just can't describe how beautiful some scenes are. Brilliantly done, I must say.
Some of the back stories of some characters like Ann who is trans also made the characters experiences more realistic.",10
It's obviously an anime type show with real people. The dialogue is cringe and and the scenarios are ridiculous and not even in a fun way. The ending sucks as well.,6
"This series is worth watching , will never feel you bored guanteed",9
"It is fun to watch new tv series but with some negative things that I couldn't give more than 6/10.Storytelling is so slow especially while people are talking that even urges you to watch in 2x speed without missing anything.There are very few original ideas here that if you like Saw series (especially the first one), Battle Royale, Cube series..etc you'll just watch another example of these without anything new. Only difference here is some blending of those with anime and action. But especially martial arts scenes are not satisfying enough that couldn't reach my expectations.",6
"I love Japanese drama, i know they act differently with different culture also, so, I am really enjoying this story, acting and so on. The story is smart, eventhough personally for me to many skin show and yea Its mystery thriller and too many dead and blood seen also, but its fictional movie right (and 18+ also) so watch it properly, somehow I only focus to the story and I think Its really original, thirlls, entertaining like watching hunger games without knowing who's the enemy (until the last eps). Can't wait for season 2.",10
"Season 2 could improve the overall score of the series.
It's good just not ""deep"" enough.
Acting is below average from the young actors.",6
"Sure, the series echoes elements of the BATTLE ROYALE and GANTZ franchises, but this obviously happens with the manga comic it is based on, so there is no need to complain. Young people are transferred in an empty Tokyo and participate as players in twisted games, from which they either survive by all costs or die. The story takes some nice twists and turns and the eight episodes have a solid direction from veteran Shinsuke Sato (THE PRINCESS BLADE, I AM A HERO, BLEACH etc.), so they will keep fans of Japanese weirdness (for example directors like Takashi Miike and Sion Sono) happy and satisfied. Plenty of violence, gunfights, katana slashings and girls in swimsuits as well, so what more could someone want?",8
"This show blends action, drama and thrills together is a great way. The characters are likeable and easy to empathise with. The action scenes are pretty well shot and there are some great memorable fight scenes. Check this one out if you're a fan of survival games or action dramas.",8
"This is based on a manga and it shows, so if those sensibilities aren't for you, you might want to skip it. Otherwise, the plot is captivating, the characters are interesting, and the twists and turns make for really great entertainment. I was genuinely surprised almost every episode. I'm so used to thrillers and anime/manga that I would get frustrated by how obvious the next plot point was and found the pacing exhausting because it was so predictable--except I was dead wrong every single time. I eventually had to accept this was a unique series and I couldn't guess what would happen next. It felt very fresh and exciting.I started the manga after finishing season 1 and was surprised to realize I think the show is better in many ways. The things I didn't like about the show, such as awkward pacing, can be attributed to the manga's flow and other predictable difficulties when adapting 2-D to 3-D. However, the show also brings a lot of the manga to life. The soundtrack, fight scenes, death scenes, and very solid acting really put this series over the top.Can't wait for Season 2!",8
"Interesting but the special effects are very cheap and low budget. Disappointed as usual by Netflix and their cheap shows, I'm serious u guys, don't expect good effects, they tried but failed miserably",4
I see quite a few people give a bad review because of the nonsensical plot particular towards the end at the beach. I also see it right now. But when I watched the show it was all fascinating and I just ignored all those flaws. This is no doubt a super attractive show that caught yours eyes. I guess all shows have their flaws especially those describing something unreal. Such shows are intrinsically nonsensical. It is for this reason I'd give it a 9 out of 10 even though it has all those flaws. I have to say the review system has flaws in itself.,9
"A TV series which is both entertaining and meaningful. I watched it dubbed and in original audio, 50/50, appreciating both for their quality. The storyline is good, but what is great is the effort the show creators have put into translating an ""anime isekai"" kind of story into a TV series. For that alone, but not only, it's worth watching. Acting is good, cinematography and sound are good also. My suggestion: if you wanna taste something different, tasty nonetheless!, you can definitely go for it!
I surely hope to see a second season.",8
"Defy logic and bad acting. The first few episodes are fine, but it goes down to drain as the show goes on.",1
"I am giving this 5/10 is only because of the first two episodes. The first two episode was so great and it always kept me at the edge of my seat. But starting from episode 3, it loses its spark. The series went downhill after that. The series became cringey, boring and illogical. I will still wait for season 2 just because i love this type of genre.",5
This is so good. i cried so much on episode 3... the games are all so cruel but also interesting given you need to think super fast with very little time and you can't afford to make a mistake because it will cost you your life... wow i could never. and i just can't help but love chishiya!!! he's the smartest one who doesn't really care about other people.... idk i just love him. definitely a must watch!!,10
"I was very impressed with this series. I wasn't expecting to like it but was gripped by the story. Excellent acting , amazing cinematography and beautiful music.",10
"Read the manga and you'll see how bad the acting, it cannot fully develop the emotions, but still, it's good live adaptation in terms of sfx etc.Moreover, the manga shows a lot of character backstory and games.",9
Worth your time if you can handle all the crying and people being chased by people with guns (but that keep forgetting to pick up dropped guns after they hit them over the head). Definitely a lot of cringe worthy scenes that make you wonder where the adults were in charge of writing and producing this. It gets better toward the end but bogs part of time on last bit.,6
"Until about half way it starts off all mature and exciting, I liked the tone and the characters. Albeit a little slow it had got off to a good start. Then the plot and acting became all childish (unnecessary yelling and crying, over the top sadism). The plot was not longer enjoyable as the focus was no longer any of the main characters as there were too many of them.",4
"This show has it good moments, but certainly also its worst. The first two episodes start really interesting but as the show progresses it becomes worse. You sort of follow the main character arisu, and he plays his part okey, but the show fails to build up an emotional connections to the other players. If they die, they die, but the show clearly tries to push dramatical and sentimental moments who are just not there. The most disappointing is the end, you sort of hope you as the viewer are getting information about what happened, why are they in the game world, where are all other people, but there is just nothing.. The viewer who watches the final has as much information as when you started in episode 1... Very disappointing.",6
"Firstly i wanna say i'm not familiar at all with the japan culture and comics etc. A friend told me to watch the show and that it was based on a comic book. Thus, I was not really eager to watch it at all. My wife insist on watching it. That was it. The show is really fun and easy to watch, the plot is interesting (but with lots of issues) the scenery is nice. The one thing that really annoyed me at first was the over-acting of the main characters but I realized that this is the way japans actors act occasionally and it's part of the whole movie culture. As a whole it's a show with a lot of suspense and i'm really happy that a second season is going to be released.",7
"The setting is what is to be expected from a manga and I need to admit that this the best part of this show, it's interesting and kind of fresh. But that's it already.Anything after episode 2 doesn't make any sense at all. And it's not that the protagonists magically wake up in a strange real world computer game adaptation, this setting offers so many possibilities, yet the show fails everywhere.Any human interaction is totally unbelievable, the decisions they make are totally unrealistic, the dialogues are wooden and off set, the acting is poor, no character development. Also the whole way the story unfolds is so unrealistic, so many plot holes, contradictions, that if you are a slightest of a rational person you will constantly stay in disbelieve and think <<Why, Why, Why ...>>.",3
"I have rarely watched something so poorly written and acted. The plot might have had interesting premises but had no solid background / explanation and lazily developed into a complete nonsense.I have the feeling the authors wanted to throw elements in it just for the sake of doing it: they did not even felt the need of clarifying anything to the viewers - many questions were simply left unanswered.Characters' decision-making is often illogical, if not completely random. Some scenes are utterly ridiculous (can you imagine teenagers chasing cars on foot over a long distance?) and, as other already pointed out, acting is incredibly cringy.I watched it until the end only to check if it gets better. And no, it doesn't.",3
"The first 3 episodes are really good. But from there on, its all downhill. The concept is great but there are just too many plotholes and bad story telling. Nice to watch if you dont want to think. I personnally would love to be more mindblown watching the series.",6
"Perfection is what it is. Despite the obvious fact that I will be one of those who will die from the first game, I really enjoyed it. Series that focus mainly on intellect as its driver usually come up great and this one was a gem. A must watch for anyone looking for something outside the box.",10
"If you get tired of OP characters in non-existent peril with Netflix's US productions, this one will fix that for you. After we watched several episodes my son walked away shaking his head and said, ""I'm going to go read All Quiet on the Western Front"" to cheer myself up.It's pretty darn good. A couple of the games had some holes in them, and some of the character behaviors didn't make sense outside of it's what the writers wanted them to do at that moment. But really watching this is more about feeling like the last year wasn't so bad compared to what these characters are going through. Hoping Season 2 can keep pace.",8
"The first episode is indeed very gripping and introduces a hope.
The hope that the next episodes will be an escalating display of clever riddles and conclusions. A hope so strong that the viewer is willing to accept the mediocre acting.Unfortunately the show doesn't choose this path. Instead we are fed with b-movie action and thriller sequences till the very end of the first season.
Furthermore we are left with a feeling that nothing really happened ... besides the first 3 episodes.In conclusion: A good concept, with some great atmosphere, ruined by a wrong script path and bad acting.",7
"If you loved Independence Day despite the infinite problems and plot holes, then this is in a similar fashion. If you dont want to think too hard this is quite enjoyable. The unknown keep the story moving along nicely. The 'games' are the star of the show. They make you want to solve them. I mean in E8 how many people spent a lot of the time wondering who the 'witch' was. If you did then this show was made for you.",8
"Some episodes are better than others, with many scenes that are obvious filler. That being said, it's still a good watch and has characters you care about.",7
"I haven't read the manga, so I can't really comment on its accuracy to the source material (although I'm of the opinion that even major changes are fine as long if they serve the director's vision)
This director really knows what he's doing. The show is a worthwhile watch for anyone who enjoys suspenseful thrillers with a heap of action thrown in for a pretty penultimate climax.
The twists are set up and executed well, and the motivations and backstories of the characters give even the most despicable characters a layer of depth the viewer can empathize with. Sato utilizes information about the characters and story masterfully, doling it out just enough so the viewer understands what's going on, while withholding the rest to make for an engaging viewing experience.
The cinematography is absolutely excellent. Framing, composition, blocking, lighting: all of it is utilized incredibly well to create some absolutely stunning filmmaking.
I will say that it can be a bit of a tough series to get into upon first viewing. The first episode meanders a bit, and the acting can get pretty overkill. The first time I tried to watch this I ended up just putting it down halfway through the first episode because the acting was just a bit too overbearing for my taste. However, once the actual story begins and the characters are thrust into the games, the show drastically improves on the pacing.
Additionally, someone unfamiliar with the nature of manga/anime might have a hard time suspending their disbelief enough to watch through all 8 episodes. The characters all end up screaming each other's names at one point at the top of their lungs in some dramatic fashion (which got kind of cringe for me sometimes), and the last three episodes are extremely shounen in nature, with absolute balls-to-the-walls action and what seems like 5 different shadowy organizations plotting against one another, each more powerful than the last.
However, this series definitely has a lot of heart, and there are some incredibly emotionally intense episodes (Ep 7 is a standout for me), coupled with some very well choreographed action, and well directed suspense. This series is certainly an emotional rollercoaster, with me equally cheering for the characters and sobbing my eyes out more times than I can count. It is definitely worth a day spent just bingeing the whole thing.",7
The acting & filming was fine. The lack of rhyme or reason made me not care. I gave up near the beginning of episode 2.,3
"It's only 8/10 up till EP2. Then it goes downhill for me. Overall, it brings down the average to 6/10, maybe even 5/10 from me.
Ep2 was my favorite. I was so scared I had to pause multiple times to get through the episode. I just couldn't. The sight of being hunted down by a masked psychopathic armed lunatic with calm and controlled demeanor was utterly terrifying. That's like my worst nightmare.
Anyway, the whole setting is utter nightmare. This is like the definition of hell for me. To be forced into participating into a game of strength, intelligence, betrayal, and wits again and again with the threat of death by laser that never misses. Incredibly stress inducing scenario. I was having anxiety in the first 2 episodes.",8
"Netflix series are always hit and miss with a few gems in between (at least for me).
Therefore Alice in Borderland looked to me like a dumbed down action serie with a lot of drama for ""depth"".
Well... I was totally wrong. Every episode was intense with good action and story driven drama. Especially the latter is really important to me because a lot of series have drama without any goal to it.
If you like a bit of over the top action/gore, a weird plot and story driven drama, this is the next Netflix serie you should watch!",9
"It's no cinematic masterpiece, but it'll keep you at the edge of your seat and keep you coming back for more. If you want a good anime adaptation, this is it.",9
This show does a fantastic job on creating a spin on the massively popular Japanese game called kings game. The jist of the game is that the king (game master) passes orders to the players who then have to complete those orders under a set time frame. There's a variety of different types and rewards the players based on their difficulty. Thrown into this unknown world Arisu and his friends try to make sense of everything and try to find a way home. The challenges that they face are sure to interest and move you to your core with something newly interesting around every corner. This is a definite recommended for me.,8
"People rating this 10/10 need to watch some good or even average stuff to raise their standards a bit. This is bad, like wrose that live Avatar movie. Avatar was pretty good compared to this.
You are shown 3 deliquent who do not care about life, no backgroud story, thurst into a game that will make no sense at times, and the way they solve these puzzles is stupid, clues like length of car that they saw before. So who ever made these riddles/puzzles with clues, needs a paycut. They totally forgot about character growth and background story, why am I supposed to care for these people when all I know is , lady is an cold blooded adulterer who has sex for no reasons, the blond guy looks like a stick but apparently is popular and is a fighter, nerdy guy is a crier and the loser video gamer who cares nothing about life is all of a sudden Albert Einstein.
After some episodes, you will forget to care about any of these flaws because it becomes totally absurd with beach and bikins.
A friend of mine suggested it to ke thinking it was Korean like Kingdom but Japanese acting, dialogues felt pretty bland.",3
"No character development, background story, rare filmsy and meaningless sex scene and flashbacks, made no sense, looks like bad live anime adaptation that no one asked for. Boring too. Acting is bad. People praising it must be Attack on Titan live movie fans lmao
This series makes Live avatar movie look good.",3
"Nice acting, nice production, horrible pacing, don't know if the story is good because I couldn't go past episode 4. If you saw Saw, or The Cube - and liked them - then you'll probably enjoy this.",5
"If you like escape rooms and Saw then you will love this!For the uninitiated that means shock and ingenuity in abundance together with an overarching mystery and sense of being manipulated by a malevolent mastermind. Also, the inspiring (or escapist) sense in which dropouts (or just ordinary people) can, given the right circumstances, become remarkable people whilst others fail.Engaging characters with existential angst. What is there not to love!Dubbed rather than subtitled but done well with excellent voice-artists.I am not familiar with the original manga but am inspired to look it up",10
"I couldn't stop watching!
Finished the whole series in one day",10
"Let's make it clear, it won't appeal to everyone. This is not an easy watching show, first because of the violence of the theme and second because of the culture of the Japanese culture.For those would stand the first and like the second your are up for a hell of a good time. This is pure madness of a alternative dimension where some inhabitants of Tokyo are send to play deadly games where the only reward is just the possibility to live a few days more. Expect lots of gruesome deaths and plot twists that will keep you want for more. The caracter development is excellent and you may even fell sad when some people die (mention to episode 3)It is true that the show does not give many answers but you get a cliffhanger that will you want for more.A must for binge watching during a weekend",9
"At first you would think it is cheesy but then you would look deep into your own soul and say... yep that is me, that is my neighbors, that is my colleagues, that is just like my boss that is just like my veteran friend, the characters really do a good job portraying its weaknesses and that is a sigh of relief, way too many make believe movies out there and this one helps to bring it home where reality meets fantasy. Now the fantasy part.... I do not know where to F&^cking start... good luck in figuring it all out because it is a complete mystery! Good for them because that is the golden calf of this show!",8
"Read plenty of recommendations and saw screenshots and this show looked beautiful with an intriguing premise.i could only get 25 minutes in. the boys are obnoxious, the dialogue is kinda stale, too many cliche lines. acting is equally obnoxious and just didnt hook me right. could be wrong but i dont see it getting to a place where its watchable to me, sorry",2
"Well, the idea was very interesting and hooked me. Also the whole production looks pretty neat and was possibly made with a good budget. Already in the first episode you could unfortunately also see the problems of the show. The acting is so over-the-top at times that you cannot take it seriously. They completely ignore show-don't tell and over-explain every possible emotion that they are currently having. Then, with the beach plot, it goes off the rails. The characters become even more like caricatures, especially the evil ones. Probably for the teenage audience, the almost entirely young and hot members of the beach can only run around in bikinis. Then, the game in the beach makes everyone go completely crazy shooting everyone without asking why. You have flashbacks explaining why everyone is like they are now, which is sometimes hilarious. That dude sitting in his room all day becoming a sword fighter in a couple of weeks is as ridiculous as the dude being bullied and becoming a total psychopath. During the killing madness one former forensic scientist manages to find the time dissolving super glue and taking fingerprints of the ""murder""-victim (!) to prove the real perpetrator. How she was planning to take the prints of people running around hysterically I do not know. The only character that was interesting in this was the blonde calm and a little condescending dude. He had a lot of presence on screen and was acted very well. Well, maybe I wasn't the target audience. Good idea, less than mediocre execution unfortunately.",5
"This is probably the best show Netflix has ever released.
The story-line is brilliant, the cast is amazing, special effects and OST are epic, and the acting is just insane.
This is one of those rare cases where the live action is way better than the manga... I binged the series about a month ago, and cannot seem to move on to my normal life. The obsession is real. Worth to watch and worth the hype for the upcoming season.Ps. Dori Sakurada and Tao Tsuchiya nailed their roles.",10
"Can't stop watching!Just..one..more...episode.Sorry, your review is too short. Please try again.",10
"When I heard that Netflix is going to turn a Japanese manga into a TV Series, I was pretty sure that it wouldn't work, because Netflix did this in the past (Death Note) and the result was awful. But this time, they left the Japanese to do the whole work and it totally worked out!In my opinion, Alice in Borderland is one of the best Series on Netflix. You want to see something that is going to freak you out and make you stuck with this show? Then Alice in Borderland is the best solution. The special effects are awesome and you can see the development of each character through the games that they play. Also the story line is really interesting!!! Love It!!!!",10
Guys.. This was so disappointing and meaningless. The « actors » are so bad,1
"I think this is the third time maybe when I write a review, but this tv show definitely earned my time and review.The story is amazing, is worth of Oscar and it t keps me on edge from the first episode till the last one.I don't want to give you details if what happens because I want you to enjoy it.",10
"Episodes 1-4 terrific, Episodes 5-8 falls down. The probelm is the series changes after episode 4 where it was interesting to that point and then we end up in a beach community and it just goes pear shaped and makes little sense after that. The cards dont make sense either the numbers or the type. Whats the difference between a four of spades and a 8 of hearts? Sounds complex but when they are playing tag or hide and seek I cant relate to the cards anyway. Its nonsensical but still good for a part.",8
"I get it that this is a great production, but the story and characters are just not that well crafted. Don't get me wrong, I'm very familiar with Japanese culture and the poker faces in most of the Japanese dramas and all, but despite the concept of the show was kind of interesting, this show is better enjoyed with your brain shut off.",5
"So, for the first time in my life I watched and liked a Japanese show. Born out of boredom moretheless I watched it almost in a day.
The story of this coming of age/action packed/slasher series centers around Arisu. A young man who's done nothing noteble with his life sofar. Gaming is what he does. As on one good day the world as he knows it stops to make place for a surreal one which is almost empty. In order to stay alive he and his friends must participate in several death or alive games. As the story unfolds the viewers get not only to see a lot of action, but also interesting background about the key players.
Once you get over the language (here in Holland everything is subtiteld) you will find out that this is a very well written and acted series. It is fun to watch and you will be as curious for the next season as I am. Highly entertaining!",8
"The pace, unpredictable nature and the intelligent manner in which the series is tailored always keeps you glued to the screen. Awaiting the new season that covers the remaining manga chapters",9
"The idea behind it is quite interesting and offers a variety of paths to be explored, just like a video game, even though it's much more focused on puzzles and mind games, but...:The characters are too generic, just like an anime with horrible writing and no clear purpose. ^ (I've watched over 100 TV shows & anime and over 8000 movies) Which is why I can say that Chota is THE MOST MISERABLE character ever put on screen. Every time he appears it makes you cringe by what he says or does. It would've been more humane if he was killed of in it's first 10 min.Arisu is the generic good guy from every anime that has no qualities other than one. He mostly looks into the void and at the last moment comes with a solution, just to make him special over others that REALLY try to solve the puzzle. He is mostly surrounded by morons, just to make him look special.The only one who had a bit of potential was Karube, but he made Arisu look bad so... of course he was killed of.Honestly, from where the show is now, Chishiya is the most interesting of the bunch because of his lack of empathy, which is much more intriguing than ""I have a purpose"" anime cliche.All in all, below average show. Too many errors in character development, bad writing and no interest to follow any character, other than seeing what's the answer for the episode puzzle.",4
"1st episode I'd give 7/10.
Cool idea, acting was quite ok and I was motivated to see more. Not many effects but everything was well made.2nd episode was a 6/10.
Quite ok and a good watch.3rd episode was a 5/10 and it already became boring and acting became worse. Also the game made no sense. My hopes that you could survive by being smart or anything (John Kramer, Jigsaw) got destroyed. In most games people must die without any reason.4-8 episodes were all 0/10.
Writing was a mess.
Acting was terrible. Really.
CGI was terrible.
Effects and physics were terrible.
And it made no sense and had nothing to do with the first episode.Overall a big disappointment and not worth watching. Trust me.Also the last 3 episodes were sooooo bad, I couldn't believe it. Nothing made sense.",1
"This series is excellent. The storyline is unique and so well executed, the pacing is great and keeps you 100% interested at all times, and the characters are fantastic. The cinematography is so good and makes it even more enjoyable.The only thing that makes me dislike this series is the fact that I can never watch it for the first time again now! If you are a fan of the manga, then this show is one of very few live actions that absolutely does it's manga justice. If you have never read the manga or have any interest in doing so, then that doesn't matter at all. This series is very enjoyable whether you are a fan of manga or anime or not - and as long as you don't mind subtitles, I think any dystopian thriller/adventure lover will want to watch this one.",10
Cool plot but the huge cringe moments constantly thrown at you are sometimes at the edge of throwing you off... Several times ive almost given this up but what kept me watching was the plot that kinda evens out the cringeness. So many clichees and strange dialogues... Can only give 5/10,5
"Plot: at the beginning it takes a while before it starts running but it is really good! It has quite a good pace and it's intriguing.Actors and Actress & Acting: well, I guess that everyone is quite used to watch American stuff, so watching something with Asian actors and actress will be a little strange at the beginning, but at the end they wont disappoint you so much.Soundtrack: particular but for this kind of show I think it is good!Conclusions: At the beginning you'll have to have some patience before it starts running. Then it takes its pace.
There are just few moments that will makes you wrinkle your nose for some behaviours or just for some absurd things, but in general is a very well done show, above of some others that are more famous then this one.",9
"Whole combination of maze runner, final destination, saw, among us, escape room aur hunger games. Loved the series. can't wait for season 2 to be out.",10
"I liked the glimpses into normal Japanese life it gives, and somehow the regular scenes of empty Tokyo were also cool. However, the acting (please close your mouth Asugi?), and the complete lack of consistency later on (once at the 'Beach') just get annoying, ruining any sense of mystery.Such as -- why doesn't anyone use the resources of an abandoned city? Canned food, comfortable houses, generators. Or weapons, which might occasionally come in handy. There's one 'game' where they manage to beat someone with a gun -- but they don't take the gun after they beat them, which might simplify things for the next fight.They also seem to have painted themselves into too much of a corner with power of the gamemasters. Lasers from the sky, phones in the lobby, essentially god-like abilities with no apparent limits or explanation. At the start it's okay as part of the mystery, but later it becomes too much. (Did someone take that tiger out of a cage? Bring it to that place, and then carefully let it go, after goading it to be hungry enough to attack? And then come collect it later).And it tries to be gritty and real, but then mixes in people punching out tigers and bopping about in bikinis in an apocalypse. Nice to look at, but made no sense. If you don't feel there's actually an interesting solution to the mystery, you lose interest in resolving it.I would have liked a bit more of an exploration. How can you maintain any power structure when you need to go randomly fight for your life every few days? Can those laser punch into the earth? If I'm in the basement underneath you, do you just get killed too? Instead you just get a bunch of over-dramatized yelling at each other. I guess it's supposed to be anime/manga, but it didn't work for me.",3
"This series is rather true to the original manga, but at the same time, the characters look realistic (sometimes when they try to stick with the original material, you get some ""colorful"" characters that are not very realistic).
I really hope they make a 2nd season (probably no 3rd though, seing how they wrapped up things in season 1, they won't have enough for a 3rd, except if they have some fillers (origin stories and parallel stories) like in the manga).
All in all, good acting, great scenery, great filming, CGI are decent.",9
I am amazed by the series. The story is deep and contemporary at the same time.,8
"Just finished watching and I loved it from the start to the finish. I thought the story, setting, acting and effects were all bang on. Anyone who's every watched battle royal will enjoy this. The brutality isn't as in your face and graphic as battle royal, but Its still not lacking in that department. Every episode ends with more questions then answer (in a lost kinda way) but it will keep you watching. I highly recommend. I'm looking forward to season 2.",10
"First few episodes are amazing and really gripping but as soon as they get to the beach house everyone seems to loose logical thought and forget they have to compete in these death game's!
Characters make illogical jumps and assumptions constantly, and deliberately withholds information from the audience to create the twists.
Perhaps my biggest gripe is the completely inappropriate way everyone dresses for games they know might be physical and need to run in!If you really love dystopias you'll probably still enjoy it but it gets very silly",6
Its so bad that it becomes enjoyable. Pure cringe and nonsense but I wouldn't mind a second season.,1
"Amazing,
Japanese are so damn creative! This show is underrated",10
"Battle Royale was a movie that I enjoyed tremendously. It's one of those movies that I can watch over and over again. Alice in Borderland shared similarities and it kept me glued to my TV.I watched Alice in Borderland on a whim because I like shows that incorporates games as a means to survival. The games are deadly and messed up and I was here for that. Granted 8 episodes are short to introduce a whole bunch of characters but at the same time but I thought the production team did well to weave in the main storylines of the root characters. You get to understand who they were and how the hell did they end up trapped in this game.I did not read the Webtoon so I went into Alice in Borderland as a brand new consumer and from my pov, Season 1 did not disappoint!The set up of the games are simple, rules and objective are clear: Survive or die. The introduction the 52 decks of cards, setting them as levels of the types of games you will play is interesting. The show also did not disappoint in the gore.I don't want to get into the details and ruined the experience of a first time watcher. I went headfirst into the show and left with wanting more. 8 episodes was too short and I needed more!I am extremely looking forward for season 2 and the next set of games!",8
"Go and watch it,I'm 100% percent sure that you'll like it",10
"As the title suggests, I did not like this series at first... but then I am not a of Japanese anime or some of the other odd things they do (their game shows spring to mind)....However, this series just got better and better and I would encourage anyone who is curious by the series to stick with it, as it has more going on in each episode than initially meets the eye. For example, in each episode there is a clue early on that gives the answer towards the end... what that clue is, I never noticed until they pointed it out... but I thoroughly enjoyed learning what it was.So the good and the bad:It gets off to a rocky start. Unless you are a Japanese film, or anime, fan you might be inclined to turn it off early on.The acting from the main characters is good.However, the acting from the extras is lousy.The wardrobe department need a rap on the knuckles here (with the extras), everything is too contrived and too 'clean'The series had me hooked soon after the first episode and it only improved from there. I am looking forward to the second season.",9
The show and the idea behind it is very good but also is very confusing. because many things do not make sense yet. I hope in season 2 we figure out about the games and its creature,6
"First Japanese show I've watched. Started off a bit ropey but hang in there and you are rewarded immensely .
Violent and quite brutal at times. Looking forward to season 2.",10
"During the show you'll be spending a hell of a lot of time wondering whether the cringey and, at times, simply flawed acting, the illogical twists and weird details (nearly every girl being semi-nude during the entire show) are part of some kind of new artstyle or whether they're just part of a not-so-great Japanese Netflix Original. Well, for me, it is the clear that the latter is the case here.",3
"This series is truly a hidden gem. I am pretty sure that once you start watching, you just don't want to stop. Only one episode in but hooked. It is based on manga which is a retelling of ""Alice in Wonderland"" story and it is an ACTION-ADVENTURE-MYSTERY-TRAGEDY-THRILLER about chosen groups of people had moved to the game world, and they forced to conquer all the games that's about death and life. On the same page, they need to participate and conquer the games in order to survive in limited factors such as time, cards, etc. For the beginning, the show starts interesting and it made me not think about thriller. Anyway, after a few minites it reminded me it was still thriller lol. Furthermore, I was ridiculous and curious a bit when they moved to the alternate world that had the stuff same as the actual world but there're only chosen people had lived in this world, so they can stay in luxurious places with Michelin food without paying. By the way, I really have to say that the storytelling, characterization, hooked point, and so on are all fascinating. Moreover, it can surprise me every episodes. Even though, sometimes I feel unbelievable with the characters' decisions and games' rules. But I love it when I tried to solve the problems with Arisu. It's literally fun!!! Like as the puzzle. Furthermore, the actors and actresses are great and they acted their character very clear and interesting. Plot is not complicated much but I really got hooked up with the scenes that Arisu and his friends joined the game, and I can't be waiting for watching what will be happened next. However, I recommend this series because I confirm it will give you a unique experience that you have never feel it with the others before.",10
"What can I say .A ok series.plot was good but they didn't justify to make it pure class .
Many things happens so quickly and the 1st stage was like last stage .with very short time .so many things happening .in middle it's lost that twist and last episode was just . disappointment .but better then nothing to watch.",4
"My favourite series is Alice in borderland because I think that this is the best series.
I love this series because there action, dangerous and even deadly games with sometimes only one survivor.
I like the actors, I find that they play their roles very well.
For my part my favorite actor is Nijiro Murakami in the role of chishiya.
This series is thrilling whit a lot of adrenaline.
If I had to rate Alice in borderland, this one would be 10/10.
For those who love action and who are not afraid of blood, I strongly recommend this series.",10
"I really enjoyed watching Alice in Borderland. The characters are engaging and the story is interesting. Also, the fact that two the main characters die makes the show even more gripping since this kind of thing rarely happens !! and it's almost impossible not to cry at episode three..I really recommend this series if you like anything that revolves around dangerous games. ;)",10
One of those odd ones that takes a while. By the time you get to e07 of S01 you may find yourself hooked.,8
"This series is amazing. Unless you're a sociopath, it will have you feeling every emotion on the spectrum. Happy, sadness, anger, anxious and it will even cause adrenaline spikes. I certainly recommend this series to both friends and family. You can either watch it with English dubbed voice overs or its original Japanese language with English subtitles. Definitely try it out! Great story and great character development.",10
"The theme is okay but there have been way better movies using it ( see as the god's will ) . The plot holes are constant and in one extent that the series are a whole mess . The death games are boring , the characters shallow and stiff and the cinematography plain . There are 0 likeable characters I swear , their back stories make no sense + the series drastically changes in the 3 episode and it's still bad . Aw and the worst thing is definitely the pace ITS SO SLOW nothing literally happens for like the whole episode . This could be like 5 minutes episodes , still trash but not such a big waste of time",1
"I honestly watched this and it was instantly my kind of thing. Play the game or die, win the game or die.The concept of the cards representing the difficulty of each game was actually a nice touch too. The cliche 1 second before the game kills you actually put me on the edge of my seat so many times and it made me want to watch more. I don't really watch series because they drag on but this definitely got me hooked.I really recommend this. If you like twisted reality, parallel universe, play sadistic games or you die then this is your kind of series.",9
Watch the cards this ain't for the money But your life depends on it. Sweet concept I would probably fold. Stay alive crazy concept and it's really good. New fan. . Love it.,8
"Starting to the end of the series, the character build up and friendship between all three of them are good .A top notch performance by Alice in acting individually. Building up the characterisation and leading to a terrific ending which kept a suspense through out the ending of the seasonBig Hope for 2nd seasonThank you.",8
I have never watched a Japanese series before and I am not used to watch anything else than English or Swedish movies and shows but I loved this one!I would really recommend it! Can't wait for season 2.,10
"Review of Season One:ALICE IN BORDERLAND is a Japanese Netflix TV show based on a popular manga (as are so many). I'm just done watching the eight episodes of season one and I'm blown away by the quality of the series. It's very much like an updated BATTLE ROYALE, with a sudden apocalypse followed by incessant life-or-death games that our protagonists have to play through to earn playing cards. Imagine THE CRYSTAL MAZE but with killer lasers and arterial spray instead of Richard O'Brien waffling on about mumsey and you've got it. Excellent quality throughout and a great mix of plot, character, FX and action. What impressed me most is the consistency of this one, usually a show has some weaker episodes but I rated all of them 7/10 or above, so it gets a 9/10 overall from me. It really is that good and I'm eager for season two.Review of Season Two:Oh dear. Season 2 is a big let down and drop in quality from the first one. There are eight episodes and at least half are filler. Some of the action involving a guy marauding with armour is fun but hardly a 'game'. There are a couple of really good games here but most are rushed through too quickly. The last episode, which explains the whole plot from the beginning, is appalling. Average at best, this one.",7
"I am amazed at how many people give a 10/10 grade after watching just 1-2 episodes (please don't do that) or a 1 or 2/10 complaining about cringeworthy acting and bad dialogues when they've watched subbed versions (noone's expected to understand japanese, but can you not read subtitles??)
In truth, at least for someone who hasn't read the manga, it is an interesting show with an exciting premise that falls kind if flat after our leads get to that beach. It does have a few characters that scream ""manga"" like the annoying Cheshire cat guy or, worse, the tattooed freak, but even with those the show remains entertaining and watchable to the end, even if it loses its grip plot-wise. Season 2 will be a challenge for the scriptwriters, but personally I will give it a go.",7
"Great adaptation of the manga.Great cast, exactly what you would expect from a manga adaptation.",10
"All I can said is that this series really know how to keep me to watching al of the episode, because this series really have a brilliant opening and ending. It's really exciting from the first to second episode but feels boring in the middle, but when you reach the three episode before the ending, it's getting moreeee complicated and all you can do just watch it till the end. Because trust me, the ending was amazing haha.",8
They have changed a lot of scenes that shouldn't have been changed from the manga and the acting is a meh for me like I prefer the secondary characters acting better than the main lead one.,5
"I haven't read the manga, but it feels like a much more appropriate means for this story, being live action the entire series comes off as silly, the characters are not believable as human beings at all and every single episode you´ll have a mental breakdown wondering why they consistently act in the most autistic way possible. DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THE HIGH RATINGS, as I was, this show isn't that bad if you´ve had a lobotomy beforehand. The first episode shows soo much potencial but in every following one the quality drops. Soo many avenues go unexplored, soo many nonsensical decisions, its a good apocalypse scenario but the every one in it dropped 100 IQ points as soon as it started. I may be a little too harsh in this review, if you´re not one to overanalyze the decisions of every character chances are you´ll enjoy this show, but if, like myself, you cant stand people acting like they might forget how to breath at any minute then give this one a pass.",4
"This is without a doubt one of the worst things to ever be created. Don't even bother watching it because you will become less of a person for it. It is simple indoctrination material to become an immoral, disgusting, pig. Please don't give this crap a good review unless you are a disgustingly evil person. If you like this show you will probably go to HELL!",1
"I will admit that I am not familiar with the source manga though obviously I am with the Alice in Wonderland. That said, this is great ride, likeable characters, great effects and an all round solid performance.As an aside, I do often wonder about a slight anti Asian bias creeping in on some of the reviews particularly when it comes to acting where it is always characterised as ""wooden/stilted"" or ""over-acting"" different cultures have different aesthetics and cultural norms when it comes to social responsibility and the like, I get the feeling people don't appreciate that...Anyway, if you like a cracking story with overtones of ""Battle Royale"" and ""cyberpunk"" then you will love this, I for one am looking forward to seeing the game masters and the queen of hearts.",8
"Super kinetic series that loses it's way towards the end but brings you back in with a nice finale leaving you wanting season 2 now! If you love manga & Japanese action thrillers like Battle Royale & Tokyo Gore Police, you'll like AIB. I've not read the AIB manga but this makes me want to.It's like Cube meets The Running Man. Highly recommend.",8
"A grisly production. The effects, particularly when town scenes look like models sitting on an animator's desk, are often subpar. Rather than try, again and again, to create wide views of districts in Tokyo, sans the populace, the creators might have done more through the subtlety of suggestive framing, thereby prompting the audience to contribute more through their own imagination. With a different approach to visuals and editing, this could have been an atmospheric, haunting viewing experience. Instead, the clank and din of the show's overly literal graphics served up grotesqueries, but little beauty. A production with a much smaller budget could have made use of a warehouse for a few days and served up less of an emetic.",6
"I think it is the best Netflix series, I have seen...",10
"I was so shocked to see another review on here stating that the show got progressively worse as it went on ""like most other Japanese TV shows"", and I'll agree that this is quite often the case with series of this type, but honestly in this case I could not disagree more.This show is an absolute masterclass in modern Japanese storytelling and it's maintained right through to the final episode. I watched it in the original Japanese with English subtitles but paid close attention to the references to characters from the famous Alice in Wonderland stories.There is unfortunately some cases of poorrepresentation of female characters, in that many are fully able, combat-trained survival types that are somehow suddenly and inexplicably incapable of fighting off weak, petite boys trying to subdue them... but other elements of the show give hope that representation and inclusion in Japanese films may be changing for the better.That aside, every episode is a thrill ride of its own, full of hidden messages and unique shots of a deserted, lifeless Tokyo that's practically impossible to imagine. I am desperately awaiting a second season and will welcome it with open arms.",9
"All the episodes are very good exept 5th one !Graphics are lit
Fast screenplay!",8
"This is like ""Maze Runner"". I am kind of disappointed as I had high hopes about this. It felt like watching getting killed in different ways. Okay,the male lead is okay with his awesome skills but no one can solve the puzzle except him. Why? Are these are too dumb? And the ending was really the worst thing that could happen. The leader kills everyone just because they influence his friend(the previous leader)!! Isn't it really funny? He killed his friend that doesn't matter at all but his friend was influenced and that got him killed in his own hands matters??.",5
"I felt this was a series of almost two halves. It started really well and it was visually interesting, good story, involved characters. But as the series progressed it got less interesting. The last episode in particular I thought was full of time fillers and pretty boring. It could have done with being a six episode series and that would have smartened the editing, which may have helped retain the tension that was there at the start and non existent by the end. Worth watching, just be prepared for it to fizzle out. Th7/10.",7
"I liked alice in borderland a lot, and a season 2 does sound interesting, not sure if its already out or? Im definitely interested in the manga/anime. But the plot was good, my favorite character would be chisiya by far. I cried a bit watching the episode where his friends were blown up, but overall it was great. Im sure the acting couldve been better...",8
"Interesting concept. Extremely poor execution. You don't care about the characters (they're all annoying stereotypes), the acting is terrible, the English dubbing is terrible, the dialogue (English subtitles) is stilted, people don't act like actual human beings, and everything takes so long to happen. There's dozens of scenes just waiting, lingering on something we already know is going to happen - just get on with it!As the title of my review says, it's a great way to get bored to sleep then startled awake by random loud noises.",4
"Painful expressions interpret all emotions. I cannot understand actor's try to express, and he is crash anytime.",5
"I wish it wasn't based off a comic book. The main character gives off the vibe of an anime protagonist and it gets annoying at times. The episodes with the games are really thrilling and good but outside of the games it's just an okay story. It's goring and violent with a lot of twists, it's just the characters I don't really like. If you love anime you'd probably enjoy this show a lot more.",7
"It's filled with many ""bad"" little things that just ruin the whole show. The acting can be very very cringe sometimes. The whole series just feeling like a teenage show and not something for grown-ups.At the same time, there is some potential in the story, there is some very good suspens, but that's about it. SO i would not say this is a horrible show, but at the same time, I wouldn't say this is a good or solid show.If you have really nothing on your watch-list, and you pretty much saw the major highly-rated tv shows, then watch this while waiting for another good show or another season of your favorite show.",7
"The serie consists of lots of twist, which help maintain your interest!",10
My brain got rapped watching the next half of the show.,6
It has been a very long time since there has been something on this level. Very very impressive. When is season 2?!?!,10
"Let me start off by saying that the story indeed does have some plot holes, and there are definitely parts where you need to let some poorly worked out details slide to keep yourself hooked, but other than that I found it quite enjoyable.Sure, its a pity that such a good premise wasn't worked out to the fullest since the premise had so much potential in itself, but I do feel people are being to harsh on it. If you take the story for what it is (fantasy) than anything is possible, including the more unbelievable decisions made in the plot.",7
Arisu is a young man who is the youngest heir in a well known family. He is careless and lives his life the way he want to. He has two friends Chota and Karube who are his only friends. One day they find themselves inside a game where they have to complete tasks assigned by an anonymous person. The difficulty of the game is shown by cards.It is an interesting series which gets you hooked on to it from the first episode itself. It only has eight episode s so we can watch it in go.,8
"This show is one of the greatest shows of this decade! So well-produced & put together! I loved every episode, every question, every answer!",10
I liked it so I had to leave a review and hope for more seasons . Very nice adaptation of the manga . Good actors and suspenseful atmosphere.,9
"A well crafted movie with, amazing set designs and plot just gets intriguing.Actors have done absolutely well, this is a show where suspense never dies and surprise never stops coming.",8
"The show's premise was actually good, if they had stuck with the same formula this could have been a lot better. Unfortunately, everything hit rock bottom with the inclusion of the bikini utopia. The plot became more ludicrous as we progressed through the beach arc. The show just randomly throws around flashbacks. There are these really sickening characters, the show wants you to sympathise with by showing their repressed past.Also stop making live action an exact copy of the manga or anime, there are some elements, that only work in anime. Including that in a live action only comes off as cheesy and cheap. This live action ticks all the boxes of the anime trope. What could have been a great survival show, ends up in the landfill of live action dumpster fire.",5
The plot is amazing and every single episode is worth to watch. Some people say it got bad after the third episode but i definitely don t see it this way. The actors did their job well. I havent read the manga yet but i can t wait for season 2!!,10
It's a great survival game series. The concept is really impressive. The story line too. And the characters development and acting are so flawless.But I got dissapointed the fight sences of the sword guy and the girl(in real he's a guy). Anyway waiting for the season 2. I recommened it.,8
The fireworks few episodes is good to watch. It was so excited. But when it comes to the beach scene i was like whoaa what the hell is this? It got me bored and stop watching. What a waste.,4
"It's a good show i love the plot, it really made me fluttor cuz how sad that they being stucked there. But for the plot i guess it is too fast so i don't really enjoy the game.",8
I enjoyed it till the end. About how the story rolls towards the ending that reminds me of Black Mirror.,10
"Fast pace, unusual events, great setting and camerawork... Minus point is 'beach', it was a bit too long and unnessecary. Waiting for S2!",10
I still have no clue where's the hype coming from. Characters development is soooo bad and I dont even feel emotionally connected with any of the characters. The show gets really cringey after the third episode. I forced myself to watch it till the last episode because I was hoping everything would finally make sense at the end but nope.,3
"This would be a 10 if it wasn't for the main character's personality. I mean, it's like a depressive emo complaining and whining about life instead of trying to figure out what's going on and how to survive. I would prefer to see a different development where the character deals with what's going on with a strong mentality. Instead we have this whining little b****, and even though it's realistic, it's not interesting to see as a main character.For me this didn't work and it was the only problem with the series. Other than that it's awesome.",8
"The writing's not the best, the acting's not the best, there are plot holes, people get lucky for plot convenience or because it looks cool, and the exposition's not the best, leading to moments that are supposed to be emotionally deep but fail.It's also got your usual mix of cliché anime characters; the smart one, the cool one, the wimpy one, the tough one, the bad guy's weird and creepy henchmen, etc.But, the concept is interesting and so are the games, and the sets are well designed too. So it does keep things entertaining enough to sit through it. Although, it's a good thing it was only 8 episodes, because even that started to drag a bit.Since there are enough good and bad elements, it lands at a solid 5/10.",4
This show was so fun to watch! I especially loved the courage Arisu has despite the amount of heartbreak and physical pain he's been through.,8
The games that they played are challenging. It is not meant for the faint-hearted / dim-witted...,8
"A unique and very enjoyable look at how humanity reacts to forced violence. I enjoyed the characters and the twists and turns. I also enjoyed having a flashback to each character's past, it had me feeling sympathy for even the worst villains, well, except creepy tongue jerk. His explaining of rape whilst licking his victim made my stomach churn, but then that's just good acting!",8
"Got hooked to the series after the first few episodes. The plots, the thrill in most of action scenes give chill down the spine. I love how unpredictable it is compared to other survival series. Highly recommend!",10
So bad. This could have been so good one. So many unlogical mistakes.,5
"Over-the-top acting, extremely stereotypical characters, no emotional connection to any of the characters, predictable characters as how you can tell which ones will live and which ones will survive, and an incredible amount of frustratingly illogical decision making by all characters throughout the show. If you are under the age of 14 or only watch anime, this show is for you. If you are over 14 or have never watched anime before, do not waste your time with this show; you will be extremely disappointed.",2
"I have started this after the hype started around Squid game. It was on my watching list for a longer time, but i never came to watch it.The beginning of the series caught my attention. It has a great and interesting story line, which wants you to know more about the story. In my personal experience, I had a hard time getting attached to the characters or understand them. At some stages in the series, the development of the characters were too fast. On the other hand, some scenes and episodes were extremely slow. I think if there would have been a balance here, the series would have come off better.Overall I think it is a great series. The games in which they participate are interesting enough, but may also seem obvious while the characters obviously play dumb. I'm curious about the second season, since some questions are still unanswered. I'd recommend you to watch this if you are in for a mystery! If you are doubting to watch because of the gore, in my opinion it wasn't that bad. There are no jumpscares and you will know when something is gonna happen!",8
"I warched through the whole series and it's a masterpiece, there's a character development , you are pretty much unable to tell what will happen next thought after it's happened it's still make sense, unlike the boring Hollywood movies where you can tell what will happen from the first 2 minutes .All of the people's who's complain about the beach part pretty much don't understand it how the game's working, belive me if you use your brain for a bit everything will make sense .SPOILERGathering is a human thing , ofcourse the elderly people's will mostly die quickly in this world since most of the game require either sacrifice or strength. Also the beach was never a charity people's gathering there to survive and not to help.And the main reason for the beach is the 10 of heart
Heart means playing with people "" heart"" 10 is the difficulty and agame with this difficulty only can happen in a large group .",10
"This show started out great. There was a real sense of suspense and mystery. The images of an empty Tokyo, and especially the Shibuya scramble, looks outstanding. Save for some green screen fuzz in their hair, the environment looks absolutely real. The story in the first half is engaging and the acting quite good, with very little of the Japanese style overacting which is far too common.And then we get to the beach where the show falls flat right on its face. The show loses momentum and its mysterious appeal. The isolation in the first part of this show really worked in its favor, but once they get to the beach seemingly half of Tokyo has shown up there to party. The beach is riddled with bad actors, especially the guy with the assault rifle and the guy with face tattoos and a katana. Everything they do is so over the top. They have drama school rejects written all over them.Perhaps this is a very faithful adaptation of the manga. Supposedly the manga was inspired by Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland, but I don't see how except in the most superficial sense in the form of a couple of the characters' names. If there is a second season I'll probably watch it, but if I said I'm dying to see it, that would be a lie.Edit: Well, season 2 was also stretched pretty thinly. It felt like we spent almost an eternity at the container park and the prison. But the ending was very beautiful, which was enough for me to raise my score by one star. I've read about the comic on which this show is based, and it seems like the characters, the antagonists in particular, are more fleshed out. Because I felt like they lacked motivation, especially considering the ending.",6
"Chaos, madness, blood, tears... Not for lighthearted.",10
I absolutely love this series and can't wait until season two. Haven't read the manga. Can't wait to find out more of what happened to get rid of basically all the people and why some are left but they have different timelines. And where do the lasers come from? And is everyone who disappeared gone or are they still somewhere? Aaand when will they find the dressed cards?,10
"I watched the series last year and very soon became one of my top favourites. I recommended to people who like action, clever thinking and thrillUnlike the squid game that everybody hype this is WAY MUCH BETTER
It's more complicated it's more fan it's more clever
Must watch.",10
"Best series in this type of genre, fast pace and accurate. Much better than squid game.",10
"Lots of bugs and loses momentum from about episode 3 and completes loses it when they get to the beach, nevertheless first 2 episodes despite the bugs are quite enjoyable and original.",7
"Came off here after watching squid game. I enjoyed the first few eps, and then the show just went off the rails.",5
"No wonder this show was a flop and no one knew it existed until Squid Game became a global hit. I cannot believe anyone recommending this after watching Squid Game. This show was a disaster with terrible acting and meaningless characters that evoke no emotion whatsoever and so many loopholes. Plot fails, reminds of Black Mirror at the end.",1
"The first 4 episodes are really good. For the last 4 episodes though, I had them on in the background while I was doing something else. Drawn out and a lot of talking. I thought it would be like watching squid game but no. I feel like you can't compare the two shows, they're different from each other. A few inconsistencies in the series but other than that I was thinking about it when I wasn't watching it.(wouldn't everyone be playing their first game together? How come some people had already played like 5 games even though the world had just shut off at the exact same time for every single person??)",5
"Great stuff. I went into this with few expectations. The first episode looked good and it just kept on getting better.Beautifully shot, well acted (use the Japanese audio and English subtitles)... it keeps you guessing. The only criticism I can actually think of is occasionally overdoing the extreme emotional close up (esp the end of the first hearts game)... but this is minor and probably personal taste.This is a great series and it seems it's been renewed too. Nice.",9
"It could have been done much more interestingly ... It looks interesting like this, but nothing special.",7
"Wonderful series, exciting and full of well-characterized characters that are easy to get attached to, a really good series. Engaging from start to finish, the tension level never drops and always remains at very high levels.",10
"Maybe it's just me that I find manga and any related series/movies exciting due to the language (any asiatic language) which I find interesting to listen (coming from a Balkan- Mediterranean background I'm a little bit jealous of their accents), but this series was actually on point. Liked the story behind it (parallel universe) and the way the characters expanded throughout the episodes. Kinda was sad in the middle (won't spoil tho) but it's a definitely a hit for anyone that likes fantasy/splatter/agony content. It's an 9 cause I'lol wait for the next season to have a complete opinion.",9
"Well, it was decent. Liked the bond between usagi and arisu but there were a lot if very strange characters that were out of place. Over all an ok production. Probably will watch season 2.",6
Far too much drama and I'd say bad acting as well.I think you can enjoy if you have no brain at all otherwise is kind of waste of time.,3
"I liked the story, the acting not that much. But would watch a season 2 though.",8
"I've never read the manga, so I don't know how well is it adapted. The first couple of episodes were meh, but starting from episode 3, the show started to pick up. Of course the action scenes and some of the characters are over the top, however, that didn't stop me from enjoying the show for what it is. Give it a try, you might either like or hate the show after episode 3 and the beach arc. If you're too critical about plot holes and ex Machina moments, you might probably not like the show. I personally enjoyed it thoroughly. Can't wait for the season 2.",8
"I saw this before Squid Game was released and at the time it was pretty original. The first couple episodes were the better of the series, definitely lagging in the middle when the introduced the Beach. Great finale though. Really great production value as well.",8
The show was disappointing for me ! The performance of the actors was weak for most of them ! It's been long time since I watched something that I couldn't wait for it to finish !That was my first Japanese show to watch I was so disappointed cuz I'm used to watch anime and I thought yeah that could live up to the amazing anime I have watched over the years but unfortunately that was not the case at all !,4
So after what one thinks might be a cool show with awesome plots and great reveals you find out nothing of value by the end of the series. There's no logic or why? Characters seem extremely mundane and really not that interesting! Feels like who ever wrote this was or is still in their teenage years. Where's the plot?? So bunch of young kinds just roam around Tokyo where everyone has disappeared to play in some game with no real reason or reward.I'm angry there was no plot. What's my reason of believing these characters are worth investing in? And the random throwbacks! If I want to even get more angry watch it dubbed!Overall not that good.,4
"The idea is good, but the story line is so weak and with bad acting typical Japanese overreacting it's meh. It got worse and worse after 5th episode. You can watch it if you can't find anything to watch..",6
"The first couple of episodes are decent enough, group of young lads, not sure about their futures, living on the edge of society, get thrown into this alternate reality where everyone else has disappeared.The sum of the 3 characters adds up to something interesting.Then it all goes downhill fast and we're all of a sudden left with a male and female protagonist who are wooden, dull and wildly uninteresting.The male lead's primary character trait is 'spacing out'. For one episode he struggles for an hour gaffa taped to a chair. Fascinating.Other stuff happens. You don't care. There's a silver haired character who looks smugly on during every scene. Not at all annoying.Then you get a random video pointing you towards the next part of the story.Its bad and I felt depressed after watching it.",4
"That's why Westerns can't adapt manga/anime , this show gets it it's very cheesy like an anime with alot of charcter depth , only thing i hated was the van episode.",10
"The four stars I've given this reflects the number of episodes that are watchable. It begins quite reasonably. We're invested in the characters, tensions are built and the mystery surrounding the game is the main drawing point of the entire show. But as the series progresses it gets increasingly dumb. The writing is plain lazy. It treats the audience as if we're stupid. The writer's are having to bend over backwards in order to 'connect the dots' re the plot..and it just doesn't work. It's just lazy writing. And basic. The 'revelations' are just basic, no other word for it. A cigar smoking chimp on a type writer spits out better scripts than this. I literally laughed out loud at each plot point that gets revealed in the final few episodes.Once the reveals are made you obviously look back at the actions of the characters in the prior episodes, piecing together the puzzle of how we arrived at the point we have...and none of it is plausible. Well... plausible isn't the right word. It's just.. here's that word again..basic. I was so disappointed with this show. Three or four reasonable episodes doesn't constitute a series worth watching. Just watch ""Squid Game"" if you wanna see how a series is written an executed properly. This was a waste of time in the end.",4
I will survive. An idle computer game fanatic suddenly finds himself with his friends in a deserted Tokyo where they must compete in dangerous games on a regular basis or die. It is a dystopian world where the game masters have no regard for life and push people into seeing how far they will sink to live. Well acted series with plenty of twists and turns and in a genre that the Japanese cinema excel in.,8
I give it a 3/10The series feels like a live action anime. Some of the characters even seem like the usual anime tropes you'd find. Maybe if I hadn't seen Squid Game when it debuted I might have enjoyed this more but nothing beats the dark grittiness of Korean cinema...especially when it's executed so well.This show is much more in tune with the Japanese anime style of mixing action with drama back to back and throwing in over the top characters and ideas to keep things interesting. The show is probably more engaging for a younger audience than for others looking to get more substance.For me I found it a hard watch because the characters are very generic and the plot revolving around them playing games for days to avoid execution is less exciting than you would think for it to be. You find yourself not caring much for any of the characters at all because they're unrelatable. So far I've made it quite a bit into the series but I found myself losing more and more interests every episode. It's hard to be concerned about characters you don't care about in a series that requires you to care if the main characters live or die in order to enjoy it.,3
"Starts well but after the episode 5 gets really messy... So many plot holes, it's kinda confusing but it's fun to watch.",6
"Great beginning with interesting drama. Suspense is higher than I expected, and creativity is on the table. The downsides are that some episodes are much better than others and special effects are bad.",8
I loved the games and how the plot was developed. It's quite awesome.,10
"Big sci-fi fan, but this felt like it was written by a 15 year old school boy. One dimensional characters with overtly misogynistic tendencies. Give it a miss.",1
"Does it require suspension of disbelief? Any plot holes? YES. Take it easy bros! It's a fun show to watch with very decent production values. Oh & being a guy, i cant complain
...lots of pretty japanese ladies here.So if your brain too tired from a crazy week at work, chill out & binge this over a weekend.",8
"Started off as a 6, then quickly sinks to 0.Teenage flick. Melodrama, cringing overacting, lousy scripting, uninteresting characters. I was still curious to see where this would take us but the acting and script bothered me so much I forwarded often. The story is similar to Squid Game, which I thought WAY better in comparison. Also, there was a lot of stuff I didn't think remotely credible. I don't mind absurdistic storylines if well executed but can't stand characters making ridiculously stupid choices. I've decided not to list them as to not have spoilers, but there were many.One minor ***spoiler alert *** though: the ""beach"" scenes seemed ridiculous to me, suddenly all sunhine, party and swarming with people (whereas until then the world was dark and the people very spare), with as the leading bad guy another cringingly overacted completely uninteresting character. Little puts me off like empty-headed antagonists. Then he dies and the next absurd psychos step in. That was the main problem with this series for me (next to a thin storyline and unimpressive acting): I didn't give a rat's ### about the characters.",1
"I was hooked with this then they got to the beach and the witchhunt began, after that it's was pointless back stories for characters that died anyway. It started to drag out over the last few episodes at this point too.And the acting started to become worse with each actor.",4
"A little bit childish with over the top bad acting, and a wafer-thin plot.Seems like an anime turned into motion picture without any attempt to make the characters or setting more realistic. It might have worked in the anime format but in this form, it just comes across as unnecessarily dramatic, corny and a bit annoying. Won't be keeping my eyes peeled for Season 2, but perhaps I'm not the target audience.",6
"Man, you see the Netflix logo and you expect the same predictable garbage you see in every other Netflix show but wow, this ain't it. It's quite special.Clearly not as high-budget as Squid Games, it's obvious it's mostly filmed on a green screen, but the characters - the gang - I loved it almost from the beginning. Too bad everything I loved is gone in episode three. I haven't watched the rest but I'm already sad that the chemistry I got invested in was offed so quickly.My only real gripe is that some scenes are very slow sometimes, as if trying to grasp for that 1-hour mark. And since Japanese culture is so different, a lot of moments and meanings are lost in translation and don't make much sense.In any case, that doesn't ruin the show, it is super enjoyable to binge watch.And unlike Squid Games, the English voice acting is actually quite good. Kinda like watching Final Fantasy dubbed.Definitely watch this. Avoid everything else Netflix is peddling to you and watch it.Values like friendship, honor, sacrifice, support even from strangers, you'll never see that in American Netflix-made garbage. That's why you need to watch this. To restore your faith in humanity at least a little bit.",1
After watching Squid Games it was recommended I watched Alice in Borderland. I'll be honest I'd never heard of it beforehand. Unlike Squid Games it gets going from the word go and for the first 4 episodes I was hooked. Unfortunately after that it all goes in a different direction and not in a good way. Like I said in the title i so much wanted more from it and sadly it failed to deliver.,5
"It's a waste of time, no explanation for anything, nothing makes sense, it's just wast of time.",2
"First episodes are good and exciting.How ever in the last ones it became way too much ""Japanese stereotyped"". At some point the story went from a good thriller to a sort of manga live action. Almost like watching another different program.Entertaining...however, is not for everyone.",5
"I won't say too much. Good plot. Lots of potential. Bad cringe acting. Not so good making. Boring in the 2nd half.I think after Squid Game Japanese fans were too eager to promote it & over sold it. The ""underrated"" kink made it stupidly overrated. & I'm not being bitter while talking about the corny acting fr I had to visibly cringe at some of the emotional deliveries. Over the top at everything.",4
"This truly does feel like live action anime. I found myself physically cringing at times, the acting is so over the top it's ridiculous. You can find all the anime clichés in this. The robot-like cool person, the insane bald bad guy with tattoos, cringy super emotional good guy greg protagonist...Another user said it feels like whoever made this has no concept of natural human interactions and this was the exact same thing that kept coming to my mind while I was watching the series.The plot is okay (although senseless) but some of the games (or solutions) make no sense whatsoever.There are a lot of androgynous looking actors, if you're into that it might make certain episodes a semi-enjoyable watch for you.",5
"Below average acting, directing, cinematography, scripting, music, pacing.Premise is ok, execution is bad. Very slow and has little to redeem itself. I had low expectations for something from Japan, and was still disappointed.",5
"The nonsense starts at THE Beach. Plus, more violence against women. Strange and unnecessary to have focus on that.Why do the killers have backstories, but not the decent characters? And such random timing with them.And who would trust teen girls to be in charge of games where people die? That was second dumbest plot point.The dumbest was THE WITCH HUNT game, where a bunch of people get murdered cause the leader said so. Said leader killed his friend, who was also a psycho. And killing his friend made him want everyone else to die and kill others.I had a problem with the shooting deaths, because they seem to stylize the shooters or make their killings seem so easy to do. Japan hasn't suffered mass shootings like the US, so they don't really seem to get the message they're sending. Nobody needs a backstory on the guy shooting a bunch of people. What? Am I supposed to have sympathy for him? He just shot like 30 people.Too much shooting death. Soured the mood of the show and made it not entertaining. I don't wanna see real life on screen in this kind of show.",4
I truly believe that this is a good show but I feel like you need to go in knowing that it's based of a manga which is why it seems like one some times with the extreme overacting and unbelievably fight scenes.Even then I do believe that this show is enjoyable to watch and I'm looking forward to season 2.,7
"The games were thoughtful and the politics outside of them were also very enjoyable to watch, but unfortunately the last 2 episodes didn't do it for me. It didn't make any sense, just felt like a forced, cheap way out + we haven't gotten any information of matter about the creators of the game or the sudden disappearing of everyone in Tokyo.",7
"Thought it was all good until around episode 4/5, but the characters they introduced let it down, really poor acting too for what should be dramatic. The Beach episodes ruined he show.",6
"Not only Netflix bad subtitles, terrible dub acting, and/or cultural differences but terrible over the top acting, nonsensical plot, poor writing, mediocre CGI and cringe fest all over the place makes this one of the worst thing I saw this year , If not ever.I'm writing this while watching epiode 6 and really trying to stick it to the end to see what sort of mess they come up with at the end, but it's tough.I wish IMDB had a feature where you have to put your age when rating as these higher rating reviews must be from really young kids, who shouldn't be watching violence anyway.",1
"OMG! Dumbest thing I've seen this year. First episode, I enjoyed. Second episode, I started feeling like fast forwarding. Third episode, I started fast forwarding and didn't stop till the end.",2
"If you've watched Squid Game, personally I thought this was much better. The games take place in a variety of locations and generally the show is a little bit more darker...The end of the season gets a little OTT on the storyline, but I thought it's well made. And I believe the reason for the existence of the games, is a bit more creative that Squid Games.Lower budget, but more entertaining personally.",9
"What a dissapointment. Really bad acting, bad Screenplay, bad storyline, just not that good at all.Some fun moment, and nice visuals, But just a huge dissapointment. At least after Squid Game.",4
"Alice in borderland is a science fiction and drama series. It's an Japanese series. It was directed by shinsuke Sato. It was released in 2020 on Netflix there are 1 season and 8 episode
The series star kuina as Aya Sabina, Ann as ayaka miyoshi and ryohei arisu as kento Yamazaki
A young man passionate about video games finds himself with his two friends in an alternative Tokyo where they must play dangerous games to survive.",8
"As others have written, the first 4 episodes are great. There's a nice intimate, mysterious atmosphere. Then episode 5 completely destroys it as the show turns into an over the top anime basically, and never returns to the tone set in the first half.",5
"It started great.. but the last episodes were just disappointing. The main girl character went from being so smart in the beginning turning to an useless character in the end.I don't understand the idea of creating a place call ""the beach"", and why in the last episodes we have to waste so much time digging into these killers' past? Seriously, didnt make any sense and didnt contribute to the story.The connections between two bosses of the Beach are not developed clearly. And the reasons for killing at the Beach episodes are just ridiculous. Half of the time you will have to hear the past stories of the killers, while the two main characters - one is running around the hotel doing nothing special. The other is tied up most of the time and just cried about his friends death from like 3 eps ago.Many people may say the games in this movie are better than in Squid games. It's just harder, not better. The way Squid game builds their characters are just amazing, turning even boring and easy kids game into a creepy survival situation.",5
"I mean...it's Bollywood-bad. It's just horrible all around from plot to screenplay, story and acting. The plot leaps over unplausible hurdles to create a downright stupid, childish story that runs of in evey possible direction. It COULD have been Tron-, Matrix- or Cube-believable, but turns in to complete ludacris. I mean, whoever wrote the outline had to be a drunk, childish hentai-fan that just wanted to portray the ""games"" with as much blood as possible with no concern as to how we got there. The huge problem with that is the whole thing crumbles on itself without clever writing or a plausible twist, even for a sci-fi! Then, in raging panic I presume, they try to put at least some substance in to a flapping story by shoving toothpaste back in the tube and jamming some malpositioned flashbacks in to the end-scenes of the last two episodes, sucking whatever air was left out of the room.To top it all up the manuscript is so flawed, so incredible amateuriatic and thin that a 14 year old comicbook-fan could do a better job under the influence of hormones. Even worse - the dialog and acting is far, FAR below anything I have ever seen professional actors do. It's so extremly over-acted and thin (even for low budget asian standards) it's embarrassing, and quite frankly - boring throughout the whole thing. The only reason I stuck it out for eight episodes of the same ""gung-ho-child-with-a-gun"" BS was to see if they managed to tie something together in the end. Nuuuup. Flying blimps with cards on 'em, sweaty teenagers with fake fear and/or courage on their faces and a plot-twist to drag things out for the money. This is so God awful that the original Battle Royale looks like an Oscar-movie. I've had enough over-acted, screaming, teenage, collage-project for the rest of my life. Let's just hope the same goes for Netflix.",1
"Yeah as it said in the headline ""don't be fooled"" by 7.7 rating (as of 16/10/21) rating. It actually is pretty bad. Had me going thinking it would lead to something but nothing at all. Guess it was a take on squid game since both nations have a bit of rivalry going on, doesn't even come close to squid game.",3
"I previously watched squid game and was looking for a series like this. In the first episodes i thought it could get near to it. A difference to Squid game is that it is not realistic as that. People are killed from lasers from sky, time traveling be like situations and randomly all people except from the players disappear.But this is okay i think, its unrealistic like the dragons in game of thrones: it couldnt be in real life, but if the other plot is comprehenseble its ok.And this is the point: After some episodes the fight scenes and the acts are sooooo horrible unrealistic that the whole plot doesnt make sense. Best example here is a scene where people get haunted by other ones with guns. They can knock them out ( this is also veeeery unrealistic) but instead of getting their guns they are running away like the blonde girl in b horror movies and are just waiting for the attackers to wake up and shoot them. At the point where scenes like this started to occur i began to hate this series more and more. Very frustating to watch.",6
"The first game in the show is a total nonsense with unsolvable puzzle that can be solved only through confusing and impossible thought process that no one in the world could achieve. How do you even start a movie/series with something totally unrealistic when later more realism is possible?There are generally a lot of logical holes with characters acting irrationally, while the whole concept of the series is based on confusing sci-fi, again with lots of logical issues and impossibilities.However, once you get through all the issues and keep watching, you can get used to the show's weaknesses and may be able to enjoy it. In the end, there are tons of totally nonsensical & low-budget shows out there, making Alice in Borderland feel moderately smart. High-budget and decent acting also helps.",6
Season 1The anime memes are real. The last game felt like it was never going to end. The whole show is very predictable. My girlfriend and I both guessed at the very beginning of the 10 of hearts challenge that she killed herself and that should be the first body to throw on the fire. How did not one person think of that?Season 2I feel like Arisu is trying really hard to be a real life anime dude. The way he runs and his facial expressions just don't seem natural at all. The pacing of season 2 is god awful so far. 1 game was broken up between 3 episodes is far too much. It didn't need to be that long.,3
"For someone who watched anime just casually and only knows the really cliché ones, this series feels exactly like one of those.From the acting to the whole scenario, it's just so over the top sometimes, it's still kinda good, but really too much sometimes.",6
"Started somehow interesting and with suspense. Lots of story gaps and scenes that didn't make sense lead to worse and worse episodes towards the end. Quite disappointed with the wasted time at the end, definitely not looking forward to waste more time with another season.I really don't get your good reviews, must have watched a different show...",3
"I really don't understand all the good reviews. The first few episodes were OK. But then it goes downhill very rapidly. People saying it's better than squid game clearly don't understand why squid game has such a wide appeal.The characters aren't likeable, most of the actors cannot act, and they have most of the females characters running around in bikinis, so I guess that's why some types of people like it.Could barely finish watching it.",2
Please finish it. It really gets better! I loved it. Yhe first few episodes come slow but then it really becomes interesting. This is kind of show I freaking love.,10
"Protagonist that is A gamer, with smart quirks but looks generic, transported into another world-time where he cant cope with reality until it takes it as a game and starts collecting rewards while people with other skills are killed, except that one love-interest. Someone who knows electronics? Nah. Corporate cutthroat? Nah. Street-smart guy? Nah. A climber? Sounds useful. The first one to die? A schoolgirl, because they are dum and you want gamer teenagers that are smart. I mean, I love isekai stories, this one is just not a good one, it is meh. Protagonist's superpower is also crying and delaying hard choices because they are hard till too late, which is not particularly attractive.Also, story is just plain. In first challenge every time they have to solve something, they will to it last second. I mean, I get it if you do it once, but always? Some parts are low tech (fried chips) but you get ultragear that looks quite breakable for just a few games? And even most simple of challenges are designed so most people, like 99% will probably fail them, so I dont quite get it ... if you win higher lvl challenges, you are ... because protagonist is just generic. He is not ultrasmart, ultrastrong, ultraskilled or ultrakind (when he gets to kill his friends, he does it, he comes around only after story-shield activates). And that cutthroat ... why? I mean, why did that boy attack her? Why did she chose to target him if he is the weakest of them all, I mean, I get it, he is the weakest of them all, but it would be in her interest to use him to get closer to the group, but instead she acts spoiled. And the most obvious flaw ... the most logical organisation for any group would be to divide labor according to skill, no one is master of everything so strongest of groups would have a strong leader, fighter, smart guy, caretaker etc., they would be well organised to tackle any challenge. But this game has a hearts challenge that is 1/4 of all challenges, meaning such groups will be the first to get wiped out. But no one is skilled in everything so you will get killed anyway more you play those games? More you play, less likely you are to survive. I mean, imagine someone is capable of that but is just too kind to let other people die on their own. So if you win, you are ... what does that tell about you. It is like game is tailored against everything, but in particular against a society and if you are to survive it, I honestly dont want you to survive it.So ... isekai with a meh story for people that dont enjoy anime. What did I learn from it? If you are indecisive and generic enough, people might take pity on you, so why not try that? Poor you. I mean, everyone else will die as a result, because kindness gets you killed, but good for you.",5
"This show had a great start, every episode made me want more. Every game had me thinking and routing for the charcters, the complexity and the easiness of each game really kept me going. The character writing was great until the beach arc where things got a little rough... I'm ot necessarily saying that the beach arc was made but it couldve been more clean and smooth and overall done better. They kept forgetting certain points that were to remebered from previous epsiodes which was quite annoying. The charcter writing for this arc was great, somthing new each episode. They lift at us on an almost cliff-hanger here, which really made us want more but to my own suprise there will be no season two for almsot an year or so if i'm correct. The acting and sets were great, very fitting and well-made. 8/10 would recommend to anyine who wants something short to binge which will distract them for a while.",8
"I'm not sure that I watched the same show that those who gave 10 stars saw.I'll briefly describe what I saw. 3 'losers' hide in a bathroom stall and get thrown into an alternate version of their world where the only people who survived were those who look good in a bikini. Even though everyone is gone and stores are fully stocked the office girl continues to wear heels and work clothes in life-or-death physical games. Episode 3 was supposed to be heart breaking but we are not invested enough into these characters to care if they die. Just because you laugh and eat ramen together doesn't mean you are a great person. The first 4 episodes were interesting because of the games but then in episode 5 the show becomes a frat party and switches to something completely different. It's high school drama class, literally everyone is the same age, the same height, the same hair, its hard to tell the characters apart. The bad acting gets worse, in comes cult-leader guy, CSI girl, inked swordsman and the return of the violent thug and blond dude who is kinda cool (has anime hair). The Tarantino-loving creators pour on the violence, so much so that its just boring and not effective.The only interesting character is the former wedding gown salesgirl who brings a cell phone to a sword fight, and of course always wearing a bikini. Even rock climbing girl is not interesting although she traps and eats rabbit instead of free food from abandon stores. Which brings me to the main character, Arisu, besides also having anime hair-style he doesn't really fit or carry the series and seems more like a spectator. He is surrounded by idiots to make his look better. But he likes to scream a lot and can take a beating.Games are clever but only solved through random and specific info that only Arisu knows, this means that the audience can only spectate and not play along.The final episodes are drawn out with flashbacks that come too late and don't add to the story.I am reviewing and rating this as a standalone series, if you have to read the book or be into manga to appreciate this series then it failed as a storytelling show. I am not rating the SFX or dubbing, that would bring the rating even lower.I guess this is intended for teens but with all the violence, suicide, sex, rape, torture, sexism and mass shootings I wouldn't recommend it.",3
"The first few episodes were quite good and it went downhill from there. Very unrealistic and like a real life anime, which some people will enjoy but it's not for me.",4
"I'm 5 episodes into the show, and I can't get myself to continue watching. The show started nicely, but quickly collapsed into a confusing and somewhat boring story, which was quite intimidating.",1
"I caught myself skipping a lot especially towards the end just to finish off this boring fest of brutal and useless now pseudo cartoon. Its so bad. This thing is cold. In a bad way, boring, character developement basically doesnt exist, games are boring and its way over sexualised for no reason. Like a cheap japanese snuff film.",2
"Absurd, Slow, Senseless, Illogical, Slow, BORING, Stupid, Excruciatingly slow (If one shot is meant to be shown for 3 seconds they've wasted 7 seconds on it..) Annoying.. Misleading ratings by bots and androids.. Doesn't even deserve 1 star.. Did I mention slow? Big waste of time! Zero star!",1
"Alice in Borderland
Season 1Three men who all have a mediocre life to it suddenly morphing into a nightmare of games...Three young men who are fiends are finding their way in life, one going nowhere, one bored with their job and and who just lost their job whom all are still trying to find the fun in life together. When they're together, they forget their problems.Suddenly their lives change when the lights go out and it's quiet. New technology is broken, with no one in sight, what is happening!?Living in a dark city, with three days apart to play the next game, fighting for the chance of freedom and safety, they must work as a team in order to survive each game. If you don't pass the game, you die. If you fail during the game you die.Will they turn on each other or work together to survive...Escape the dark city and end the games, or forever play and try to continuously survive like a nightmare of ground hog day over and over again.Who is the creator of the game?FOUND - a room in the railway station with cameras and computers, with a bunch of random people watching on the games of the death and survival of those playing. Once thinking they were the game masters - WRONG. They were also pawns used in this game. A woman suddenly appears on the computer screens and is dictating the final games. Who is she? Another pawn?So many questions!? I believe Chishiya (the blonde male) has been relatively calm throughout the entire game... does he have something to do with it?? Is this another Dark City type film where the human population have been taken from the world to another fake world?? The biggest question is where are the lasers coming from and who is controlling them as they're coming from the sky. This is why I believe it is a fake world. Unless there are satellite type objects in the sky being controlled by computers on the ground.? Are they aliens controlling this new world?? Is it Arisu's father/brother teaching him a lesson to do something in his life?The FINALS -A deck of cards were used to depict every game's level of intensity from easy to hard and also the genre - emotional. All numbered cards are played, with the death of most players under its belt, the final players will play the remaining face cards - who will survive the final games?...Season 2 to hopefully reveal.",8
"How is this rated so high? It started off really good with good character development but fell off flat. It has more plot holes than you can shake a stick at. The killing of the main characters, for what? There is no gain to it. The games make no sense and the beach makes even less sense. For instance how does the woman now the answer to the flood light bulb game yet they don't yet have that card. There's thousands of people there yet they still need loads of cards. There are 58 players in the last game but only 12 phones, they save a phone for Arisu but then Aguni and his crew come who haven't taken a phone.. Then about 100 people are killed, when killing people wouldn't have won the game anyway because they needed throwing on the fire.",2
Definitely interesting! I'm hooked and awaiting the next season.There were parts that were slow and strange and a little repetitive but overall entertaining and cool.,8
"I've been on a drama binge following Squid Game and after watching both that and Sweet Home Alice in Borderlands was good follow-up! The story and setup are simple, high IQ Shut-in and his buddies get trapped in a copy of Tokyo where they play games to survive, nothing new but exciting none the less.Story: The plots nothing crazy. The first episode does well in setting up both the main group and the games. Something to note was chemistry of the main 3 boys. It's great, it's so real, you'll get attached to them and their persona very quickly as their dynamic is pretty relatable. The games, start strong. This show isn't crazy gory but the first death is chilling and gets you amped to see how the games progress. The games overall are pretty fun to watch as they're all puzzles that you'll definitely say ""huh, how"" as our MC blows through them.Characters: They're great! The choice in actors and their performances were very well done. The sad and depressing scenes had me SAD and the intense moments at the edge of my seat. You could tell the actors were in tune with their characters and it made the show all the better.Overall: Alice in Borderlands is a great show with a simple premise, fun and interesting games, great acting and engaging cast. When season 2 drops, i'm going to be right on it!",9
I've done something like this also in my creative writing class. I start with a great story with interesting characters and a unique premise only to realize I can't find a logical ending to tie it all together. So I throw a bunch of nonsensical crap at it and hope the teacher doesn't notice. C-,5
"While there isn't any nudity, there's a lot of women only shown wearing almost nothing. Guys are almost fully clothed.The show is filled with long crying scenes. And the logic in the series is just broken.Overall, it's entertaining not bad.Cannot be compared to Squid Game for sure.",5
"It is a little long-drawn, like an anime, but thats the japanese production. It is much more exciting and entertainment than the Squid Game.It is undervalued compared to squid game.",10
"This series started off great but became more generic and less interesting around episode 5: the writing started to feel quite forced. I still finished and enjoyed it. I'd say it started at an 8 but was a 5 or 6 before it ended. So, averaging out to 6 or 7.",7
"There's no question that this is a very good series for fans of this genre but it also unquestionably falls short in some key areas that prevent it from being a 8.5+. Right away, you'll get that nice feeling of familiarity because you've probably watched the likes of Saw, Battle Royal, Cube or maybe you've just finished watching Squid games and are now open to the idea of fighting through subtitles and horrible dubs in search of older but watchable material from foreign entities.What we have here with Alice In Borderland is a fresh take on the classic survival scheme at the hands of a mysterious and largely unknown force. The acting is superb, casting is spot on and the story is healthy, but man oh man did they ever miss an opportunity with the death scenes!Time and time again you'll see the same 3 things play out while expecting something more to give you that same shock and awe that you got the first time you watched Cube or maybe one of the Saw movies. Here you do have a lot more dramatic tension and better acting but the effects and demise of characters is blatantly unimaginative. That'll not only does this. Quickly become repetitious, but it also causes things to get rather predictable.If there's a season 2 (and I suspect there will be) if they're able to turn pump the gore and effects to match other current shows such as The Boys, Brand New Cherry Flavour, and some of the classics that I previously mentioned, they should be able to add that extra Umph, really shock the audiences, then we will have a timeless classic.Still worth watching though, and I should give them credit for adding more of an element of mystery which seems to have been lost up until episode 6 at least.",8
"However if you are Otaku change the grade to 9/10. Very immersive, very inventive, and very Japanese (requirement for beach outfit? Insane!). Highly recommended!",8
"The first 4 episodes were okay, and you want to look how it keeps going,
BUTE the final 4 episodes....like another series ?So i give only 7 stars because of the first 4 episodes, and hope that the second season will be better.Have potential, which for me was wasted in the second half.We will see how it goes on.",7
"Half naked Asians in swimsuit, villain with tattoos & anger issues, the cool boss with sunglasses, female side character with obsession to the main character, everything a teenager would look for is included. The acting was okay but the atmosphere and the way the story got told didnt catch my interest and was kinda dry, especially in the last episodes. We also dont get any explanation about unrealistic stuff that happens in the movie, but also the plot twist is... missing? The ending could be a hint for season 2, so we get more about the plot twist in the following season but not sure if i will watch it.",6
"Most of the games were really cool, the show went downhill the last couple of episodes. The acting got pretty bad and beach part was also boring. They also stretched the episodes alot by having the smart characters explain everything to the others who are extremely dumb.",6
"I understand this show doesn't suit everybody, but for the people who like these kinds of shows, I would say besides some of the puzzles being a bit too obvious this shows magnitude and detail is so immense it will have you at the edge of your seat through your entire watch especially episode 3 and 8.Definitely a must see 10/10.",10
"This is a poor man's version of Squid Game. Horrible writing, horrible acting, full of plot holes and inconsistencies. It is decent in the first couple of episodes and then goes downhill from here. At moments it is obvious the writers are just trying to drag it out.",1
"What a waste of time ! Trying to be like ""squid game"" except that it has nothing to do with it.Very badly acted, scenario completely stupid.... Really no interest.Please if you want to spare some time do not watch it.Otherwise good luck...",1
"That's the first time I got deceived by an imdb rating. 7,5? Really? More like 1,5 for the effort only. This show is slow, boring and has no content for long 45min episodes. Seriously, none of the episodes had content for more than 15-20 minutes. It was a pain to watch, even skipping a lot of extremely irrelevant scenes. What a joke.",1
This show is way better than squid game i just loved everyone's acting i just can't wait to see season 2 hope it comes soon. I would love too Kento Yamazaki in more shows he's a great actor.,10
"After squid game i came to know about this series. And this one is not as good as squid game but yet it has a lot of potential. From the get go, it keeps you on the edge of your seat and keeps you guessing what is really happening. But till the end you can't guess what's really happening. It is a good series with decent acting and suspenseful drama.",8
"I just don't get the hype, far to compare with squid game, not even close.It's just not make sense from the start, how the main character (I don't know + don't care what his name) so easy leave his home and become homeless boy instantly, the meet his 2 friends and the world change to strange instantly, and the boys just seem to be careless, then...the game just begin with the ridiculous way.",1
"This is ridiculous TV show that not make any sense at all.Yeah I know this is manga base movie, but this is just too overacted and overrated.For example from beginning, the main character (I don't know and don't care what his name) was so easily make decisions to become a homeless instantly, the again instantly meet his 2 friends, then instantly the world change become strange, and again INSTANTLY they didn't show any shock but careless and seem happy, and again INSTANTLY they ""in"" to the ""ridiculous games"" and so on...Just forget this show, not even close to squid game at all, never ever can be compared.",1
"There are Series on Netflix that you have high hopes for or just seems good, but end up flat on their Faces when you finally watch it. On the other Hand, there are Series that you don't have a lot of expectations or know little about, but turn out to be a really big surprise.This is one of those Series, I just tried it out and it turns out to be one of the best Series I have seen this Year. It is a Mystery-Action-Adventure-Thriller about a group of Friends who end up in a Place where they are forced to participate in Games that result in Life or Death.Each Game is unique and thus have to be solved in a relatively unique way also. The Pacing, Storytelling, Characterizations, Acting, etc. Are all pretty good, there's not a lot of dull moments in the Episodes, there's always something interesting happening.It is like squid game but its better than that. I really recommend it to those who are fan of squid game.",9
"I really wanted to like this one, but by experience I know that live action from manga are always cringe worthy with extremely rare exception. This one didn't made the cut.Bad acting and bad written character. I mean come on, you are in an empty Tokyo and you hunt rabbit in TOKYO and live in a warehouse...as much as the character only characteristics is her connection with mountain, that's stupid.Main character is not even likable, just a whiny looser.",3
This was a fantastic show and kept me gripped to the end. Binged it in a couple of days and loved every minute of it. The show is exciting and keeps you guessing till the end and has some good and upsetting twists along the way. Fingers crossed I don't have to wait to long for season two.,10
"I watched the show right after squid game, as suggested by some friends. I found that the only thing they remotely had in common was the game theme and the asian production. They took a somewhat ingaging premise, even if quite derivative, and then dragged a bland and ridiculous episode after the other.The characters were cliché and dull, and after almost 8 excruciating hours I couldn't care less if they lived or died. Even the ""genius"" otaku main character was really inconsistent, and went from superhumanly smart (in order to justify some absurd plot twist) to umbelievably dumb, to the point of forgetting the type of the game he's in or not noticing giant clues right in front of his face. I could go on for days just listing the nonsense sequences, stupid and pointless dialogues and over the top drama.And I forced myself to carry on hoping to get a minimal explanation, a resolution, something. But it ended with another useless cliffhanger, setting up the same tone for the second season. Needless to say I won't waste anymore time to see it.",2
"If 0 was an option to put it would still be waaaay to high for this waste of time. Borring, no real plot, unrealistic characters, many inconsistiences. The worst series I watched on Nectflix and believe me I am really keen on watching bad Netflix.",1
"I binged through this due to a flu infect and I liked it. There are too many illogical flaws in it to be a masterpiece though. For example:during the first game where they meet the Beach people in the appartment complex, why didn't the ""military people"" bring any weapons? There wasn't a rule to don't bring any, wasn't it?with the existance of Hearts games and the reason that you do not know before the game whether you enter a Hearts game, why on earth would you bring friends? That's complete BS.the head of the Beach, they told us ""why didn't he bring some soldiers"" after he died. Well, because of the Hearts games? Was he supposed to have people willingly die for him?And several more... also the end was too dragged out. They should have done the last two episodes in one and skipped a lot of the obvious drama. Overall it was fun, LF season 2.",7
"I watched this after getting caught up in the Squid game hype, it came up as a suggestion on Netflix and it was far superior to its Korean counterpart in my opinion. Fast paced, gory,intriguing storyline etc. Highly recommend.",8
"The show has a very strong start at a fast pace with an unique approach of the genre. One can't really ask more than that. But then, all the premises fall very soon by changing the style of the story too soon. Basically, from episode 1 to episode 3 is Season 1, and the rest is Season 2. The biggest problem I've had is that the ""games"" are often too complicated which makes me confused rather than being engaged in the activities and feeling the suspense. The best example is the games in SAW series. The games are simple but deadly. It's all about the execution. There's only one way and you know how to win the game. Of course they differentiated the games in this show by making them more like sophisticated puzzles, but then again were they trying to show up their writing skills, or let people enjoy the show? Ever since, Death Note released, a similar troupe has been introduced in many media in Japan. At this moment they just want to show up their intelligence. ""Look, how smart we are."" Okay, I get it, but don't you want to use your intelligence to make the show more enjoyable like Seinfeld? Even though the show has a nice stylish setting, but it doesn't live up to it because again their focus is making the show look smart. Also there too many behind the stories of minor characters. Oh, by the way, where are the older people in this show?",4
"The first and second episode were ok. Then the descent began, in my opinion. Something that offended me completely as a human was that they abused the female body, which at the same time makes me think about the position of women in Japanese society.",1
"I really liked Arisu and his smartness, especially in the first game ""Dead or living"". His reasoning ability was so strong enough to solve how to know witch doors lead to death and witch not. I was pretty suprised how the ending was so weird. I were thinking that it would be just so Arisu gets an infinite visa. Kinda sad how Arisu's friends died in third episode. Anyway fun series 8/10. GOOD.",8
"I liked the atmosphere of Alice in Borderland very much. They have built a sort of dystopian feeling in the series that carried through all episodes. There was energy in the beginning and the plot was getting thicker towards the end. In between the series lost it a bit, and some twists in the plot and solutions to tasks came somewhat out of the blue. A nice series though, yet not as good as Squid Game about the same theme in my opinion.",7
It's not similar to squid game but it is wonderful one. The half episodes were great but after they go to the beach I found it quite boring. But it's great. You can surely go for it.,8
"The issue of false reviews to help hyping a show is becoming a worry. This way we can't trust a rating anymore, we will just make up our mind watching. This would mean the end for IMDB. This show is boring, stupid and useless. Just watch this if you run out of sleeping pills.Yawn.",1
"I was really compelled to watch this show, but they killed off some major protagonist Arisu's friends early in the show just for shock value. If they killed them off later I would of felt less upset, its like the author could have used them to make the story more compelling and build on them, but he just threw it away. I was turned off by it.",6
"I started very good and it was very promising but after the few first episodes, I felt disappointed. It could be better.Kento was pretty good as well as some other actors.",8
"While looking for other recommended series on IMDB, I came across this one in particular. After investigating a bit deeply, it gave me at first some ""Squid Game"" vibes, which I'd observed a few months ago and left me with a very bittersweet experience. However, I decided to give it the benefit of doubt to see how it played out. Eight chapters later, I can say without hesitation that despite not having the high popularity of its South Korean counterpart, ""Alice in Borderland"" is a superior series and by far.Although it bears some similarities with ""Squid Game"" in terms of plot despite being released a year before the latter, the difference is that the creators of ""Alice in Borderland"" planned and executed it carefully, while maintaining its fidelity to the same-named manga most of the time. As a result, the plot never fell short or felt unstable during Season 1 and the plot twists were literally brutal and surprising. Furthermore, they didn't skimp of creativity, suspense and tension factors (especially when it come to the games), something that kept me glued to the chair to see what happens next.Regarding the characters, this was perhaps one of the series' characteristics that stood out by far. The creators did a flawless job in the way they were presented to the audience, especially when they gave us the chance to see their life backgrounds through flashbacks, whether they were main or secondary. They also scored high in terms of showing an authentic chemistry between themselves (especially with Arisu and Usagi) to the point of connecting with the audience progressively and the individual character development on each one of them. Here I want to highlight an aspect and is related to Hikari's case. Although I was surprised to find out that she was trans (since I thought she was a woman all that time), the creators of the series didn't excessively focus on her sexuality or gender as it generally occurs in western series, but more on her abilities and capacities like anyone else. So I give them high props.Ultimately, if you were one of the people who liked ""Squid Game"" or felt that the aforementioned series partially met or did not meet expectations at the end, I highly recommend that you watch ""Alice in Borderland"". I assure you that you'll love it. As for me, count me in to watch Season 2.",9
"If you Battle Royale, you will love this. I don't know why i delayed watching this for so long. I became hooked after watching the first episode. Yes, you will see resemblance to Squid Game which is a show that I love, but i think Alice in Borderland is better (in terms of gore and plot). Can't wait for Season 2.",9
The best show I've ever seen! I've also read the manga. The whole show was incredibly well adapted to the manga. On the other hand there's one thing I'm hoping for as a Koudai Tatta fan. Maybe please give that boy more screen time .,10
"This is probably one of the best series I have ever watched, it is very original and entertaining.The film quality, acting and script writing is beyond beautiful and it really puts you on the edge of your seat.I also appreciate the changes they made from the manga, as I feel it is an improvement, and I pray that the ending will be changed as well as I genuinely hated it in the manga. Either way, Netflix played magic on the manga and I trust them. I 100% recommend this series.",10
"How far will people go to stay alive? What burdens are they willing to heap upon body, mind, and soul to cling to this fragile existence? At what point does the cost build to a point where one will no longer be willing to pay the price a situation demands. What then? Will they resign themselves to the cruel hands of fate? Or will the human spirit prove itself powerful enough to not only find a way out, but forge one if need be. Considering both its respective books and series, Alice in Borderland is the rise of a new era of death games capable of capturing both apocalyptic and survival horror. The series owns a high profile in the actual design, plot, execution of the games, choice of music, filming, and developing intriguing characters.",9
"Have you watched ""Squid Game""? YOu'll love ""Alice in Borderland"" for sure; it's Japanese with American voice dubbing, in a less annoying manner than our British cousins attempting those awkward Asian/English translations you see. The suspense is quite captivating and fascinating to watch at times. It's now very bloody, but rather relies on the acting and emphasis on hand gesturing. I think this is a winner here, as I give it two thumbs up. Cheers, and enjoy, Murf.",10
"The crime about this series is that it is only 8 episodes for the first season.I usually know if I will like a show within the first 5 - 10 minutes because I respond most to character. Alice in Borderland establishes all its driving characters very well. You want to spend your time watching these people.In terms of story, the show moves at a very consistent pace. Each episode has well marked out thrills while the overarching storyline fits seemlessly into the mix.The stakes are always high in Alice in Borderland with worthwhile pay-offs. I'm excited for season 2.",9
I simply have no words. This is in my top 5 favourite shows of all time and it definitely deserves it. The atmosphere the characters the story everything is simply put together to create this amazing show. I would talk more but i would have to spoil its manga so no.,10
Brilliant ! Non stop action blood and guts! I really got into squid game but this is on another level! Game ideas are warped! Fully recommend. Can't wait for season 2!,10
Watched this show before squid games and it's honestly so much better and deserves the hype. They aren't comparable in all ways though. I like the originality of the card deck and different type of games based on suits. Definitely plays with your heart in all of the good and bad ways.,10
"Alice in Borderland is one hell of a crazy project. From the setting of the place that is not playing, the actors are many, and the story is very good. Actually, there are already many films of the same type. Like The Cabin in the Woods one of them. And the games here are fun and meaningful. But this is too fantasy. Actually, fantasy is okay. But it's the type of fantasy that makes us think, ""I guess this is really really impossible."" How come. Stories like this usually have a character who manages everything. But because the setting is unbelievably extensive, which group can try to manage this? If that's the case, only God can do that. But actually, there is one plausible possibility and if it doesn't happen it will be even more disappointing. Namely, the characters in this series are in a virtual world, and they are sleeping in the real world. But it's okay. Luckily there is a second season. Hopefully it's much more exciting and challenging.",6
"The only annoying part of this excellent Japanese TV series is you are given no explanation, in visual or spoken form, of how - and why - it is that the Card Game of Death participants were secreted away to an empty Tokyo. Other than that this is an absolutely terrific watch! Episode 6 is the only part (to date) that was a little slow and quite meaningless but all the others are a riveting view...at different paces and twists as you make guesses about each of the main characters. A few flashbacks give you history about some of them but, the show begins with the leading actor sat playing games, on his PC, in the real world environment...until he is magically dropped into a wacky situation of an ""Escape Room"" adventure...except that its Escape City, Tokyo!One of the things I liked is the actors were all blending well together and, they played the parts of what people would absolutely be like in real life in a similar situation. There's a little of a ""Purge"", ""Hunger Games"", ""Escape Room"", ""Battle Royale"" and ""Lord of the Flies"" feel to it all. It knocks the socks off anything coming out of America (which is not hard to do these days).Play the insanely twisted mad game and stay alive, to pick up the playing card, and do the same again the next day are the simple rules; except its not as simple when you have a few wack jobs, killers and devious backstabbers playing also!Television at its finest; in Japanese and dubbed English language versions.",9
"As per the tradition of Japanese anime, the narration is character-driven despite them being all utterly depthless and unoriginal. Every possible tedious manga cliché you could think of: the Hikikomori character who must overcome his insecurities, the insuferable dork who loses his virginity to a desperate sex bomb, the.big-hearted bosozoku, the mysterious white-haired teenager, etc. The acting is atrocious (though I must admit I watched it dubbed, so perhaps take this one bit a grain of salt), and at any rate the script string platitudes that would make any YA film sound like f'ing Shakespear. The world-building so far is mediocre (Im at EP3), a shotgun wedding of Harsh Realm and Battle Royal, without the grit of the first nor the minimalism of the second.Animes are rarely 'good stories' - when they are 'good animes' it is usually because they are redeemed by spectacular graphic feats, or because the freedom afforded by drawing allows what a camera couldn't. Animes or mangas adaptation are usually terrible, most of them basically just fan-service, the rest being vacuous action flicks. This series belongs to the later.",2

"Dystopian survival thrillers is a genre that is personally a minimum guarantee content for me. Take Hunger Games, Maze Runner, Squid Game and AiB...All of them are atleast worth watching once. AiB is the best of all these I'd definitely say. Right from the very first episode ( The first 10 minutes drags the narrative though ) , it grows in you and makes a better bingewatching experience than Squid Game.",9
"Why, in the ever living holy hell, couldn't a single good guy simply pick up a gun from a fallen enemy in this entire show. It's infuriating to watch.",7
"One of the best show in the survival game based genre. Very entertaining. If you already watched Squid game and liked it, then you might love this show too.After finishing this show, you might think, this is even better than squid game ??",7
"No one care about character,story or anything else there is only 2,3 games that aren't that bad and make u watch next episode but everything besides that is absolute garbage like soooo dump for example in e7 or e8 a guy punch tiger and tiger get knock out!!!",2
"It's pretty obvious that this show is geared toward teens and pre-teens. The writing looks to be the product of a 10 year old. It's replete with mind numbing gore, scantily clad women, and over the top action. Mind you, I don't mind any of those things, when done well. Unfortunately, ""done well"" is not in the vocabularies of anyone associated with this project. I do have to admit, however, that I laughed many times at the moronic story and imbecilic plot. Also, the dialog was atrocious, but that could be due to poor translation.Edit 12/26/2022:
Not sure what possessed me to do it, but I watched season 2 hoping that things might have improved. After all, I enjoyed the premise of the series, as well as the individual episodes; the writers were just incapable of actually bringing their vision to life. It still has huge plot holes, stupid characters, and horribly boring and inane dialogue; but it was slightly better than season 1 ( I was going to raise my rating from two stars to three). But then we came to the big confrontation with the King of Spades. That episode has to be one of the worst TV episodes I've ever watched. They used every action/fight cliche imaginable, and not in a good way. People died, then they were alive again, then dead again. OMG, I almost ripped out every hair in my mostly bald head.Then to top it all off, they ended with a truly dreadful and mind numbing final episode. After that, I considered lowering my rating to a one, but decided I'd leave at two since not every episode sucked.",2
"After episode one you might suspect this one of those series whith a repetitive pattern in each next episode, in this case, a new game they need to survive, but this is not the case. Each episode brings new plot twists and character developments, making you want to watch the next one, the hallmark of a good series. Deserves a second season to tie things up, which is coming this year it looks.",8
"The beginning has great cinematographies and a decent a plotline that is puzzling and fairly engaging. But like a lot of people mentioned in their reviews, after the casts arrived at beach later in the season, the show just completely forgot its realism and turns every support character into clueless peons. The actors at beach are also quite bad characters that defy logic and reasons. All in all, if you don't think when you watch shows, this is definitely the show for you.",6
The show is great the first 15minutes r insanely stupid. And then they bloat the episodes HEAVILY with unneeded backstory. Its unneeded because its backstories of sidecharacters that are about to die in like 3 minutes which ruins the pacing heavily.,7
"I wasn't even a little bit impressed. Only the main character knew how to act but even saying that feels like I'm giving him too much credit. I was not attached to a single character and even when we finally figured out who one of the major game operator was, I wasn't even shocked because the drama made no effort to make any character memorable so I was like « who tf is even this lmao » Don't bother with this just watch Squid Game. Only reason why I gave 2 stars was because the episodes were pretty short compared to the usual shows i watch which means I got through it faster.",2
"A lot of people compare squid game to this but I don't think it's really comparable. Except for the game thing but it's like a drama vs show based on manga. So there are some weird characters who look like no one in our world, some weird reaction, action and fight sometime (often) not realistic but cool. Lot of flashback while people are fighting lol (just like an anime).Sometime, the reactions of characters are just like... why the hell he's doing this? LolBut the show was fun and we want to know who's behind all of this.",8
"I can't say that it is boring in any case. The first half was very interesting, after a certain point far fetched. Perhaps if it was planned for one season instead of two it could be much better. Not a master piece but not trashy either. I watched it pleasantly, but i am afraid what the second season will be.",5
Some of the puzzles in this show are better than Squid game but I a also just as confused as the next person. So is everything a simulation? I enjoyed the first five episodes but then the show drops.,7
"Poor acting, poor directing and bad plot story..I feel very strong resident evil vibe in the camera shooting style, animation set, and back song..Everything just..No..",4
I'm waiting for next season so i can get more information but so far so good. I feel like a lot of the bad reviews are just because they wanted everything laid there for them since the start and in just 1 season when this tv show is based off a manga which has more plot to give lmao.,10
"This Japanese thriller about a group of contestants getting trapped into a games to the death kind of tournament is all the rage these days, so naturally thought I'd check this one out. It plays a lot more like a manga in its realism, mainly in that it does not strive for it. It's weird, most of the characters are superficial, and the premise is just baffling. Like most of these styles of thrillers it begins leaning into the ""community"" / ""relationships"" between the characters for the latter part of the season rather than the ""games"", and in my opinion only declines in quality. It's a show that thinks it's really clever and continually repeats how much it thinks it's clever over and over because it clearly thinks its audience is dumb. They aren't dumb, but this show is. Watch Squid Game instead, is much better.",4
"While watching the first part of the season, I longed for watching more of the games and the lore bits killed the speed, the second part the lore comes out really well in my opinion. Don't take this series to seriously, as the realistic properties lack a little.",7
"The bad and the good the great dilemma, where every action has a positive or negative reaction in humanity. A series where they have mixed the two sides of the coin in one game.",10
"The first few episodes are fine, I enjoyed the game itself but the whole plot in the community was pretty bad.. I don't understand the high ratings. Season 2 is coming for children ??",4
I never watched anime or read manga but watching this show made me want more of the genre. The acting and visuals are incredible. The plot does go a little off the rails but its still very fun and emotional show. The characters are great and the character development is also well done.,9
"Exciting Japanese Tv-show that gonna send chills through your spine. I discovered this series after I've seen Squid Game, and man, I was not disappointed. Great thrilling game-sequences that will make you hold your breath. Very good, Japan rules! ????",9
"Starts well but after the 5th or 6th episode, it offers nothing new to see. I liked the first few games that were better, deadlier, and more intricate than Squid Game. But the series deviates from games and slowly focuses on the 'Beach'. That's where I lost all interest. It doesn't offer much for someone interested in the game itself rather than the environment. Almost all characters are annoying. Production Values are great.In short: This is not bad, it is way overrated.",7
"Alice in Borderland has a legitimate plot and is a show on exploitation of human emotions at a progressive rate. The predominant feelings of loss the protagonist Arisu experiences are revisited at various instances throughout the series.The plot builds up a bit slow but eventually takes flight to full battle mode. The fact that the games need more than muscle power to win is appreciable. (This is in fact a loss for Squid-Game). They are filled with riddles and need quick wit and endurance to see them through.I would have loved it if more game sequences were included in the series. The gore level is subtle and the little bit of CGI used isn't that well defined but it hardly affects the series' performance. Another plus, the protagonist isn't shown as the perfect specimen, which makes the viewers connect to Arisu at some level.Psst. For the fellow BL lovers out there:
Keita Machida's performance as Karube is in vast contrast to the Kurosawa san role in the rom-com BL, Cherry Magic! You are greeted by a completely fresh perspective as compared to the calm and mature Kurosawa san.",9
"I don't know why isn't this serial as popular as Squid Game. Because it has the same plot and logic of surviving. However, some moments have really illogical acts of actors. For example, when everyone looked for murderer, they just need to watch surveillance cameras and instead of it they really thought a couple of hours who is really murderer.",8
"Actually, this serie is extremely good. The designs and sets are completely beautiful. And the plot is so wonderful that captivates you all the time.The only thing that i really dont like, is the fact that some situations end up really quick, like we want more scenes about this.But if you like movies such as battle royale or action movies, you'll love this show! ...............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................",10
"This series is much better than squid game, even though the story is a bit different. The acting skills were on point and the last episode was definitely my favorite. You also see throughout the series that each character has a certain talent that they also apply during the games they have to play. I think it's a bit weird with the cards that they have to collect, it's not clear yet what to do with them. But hopefully in season 2 it will become clearer. They say the books are better than the movies, but I personally like the series better than the book itself. Maybe because I'm not really into manga/anime. But for the rest, this series is definitely recommended and if I can give you a tip: WATCH ALICE IN BORDERLAND FIRST AND THEN SQUID GAME!",8
"I was always impressed watching Asian films or series. It's fascinating to see how, like most productions not made in & or around Hollywood, they tackle their subjects differently & yet are able to visually & emotionally touch your inner self.The plot is a bit of a mix between Battle Royale & Squid Game plus the characters are generally cardboard cutouts. It is in the way the characters are used that feels refreshing & the twists & turns are genuinely surprising. The action is finely shot & edited, with a raw brutality that reminds the viewer of the desparate situation the characters are in.The end definitely left me wanting more, I'm looking forward to season 2!",10
"Season 1: This show certainly keeps you on your toes. It's bold and takes risks. Sometimes it's hard to say whether they paid off or not. For example, killing off all of Arisu's close friends so early in the season after spending quite a bit of time building up their characters definitely had to be a tough decision. The first episodes alongside his friends were very good and then the show almost reinvents itself midway through the season with the introduction of the beach. This isn't to say that the loss of his friends didn't play a significant role still , it certainly did, but it completely changed the dynamic.Arisu and Usagi have a good chemistry throughout and their budding romance is quite believable .I'm not sure the lengthy ending after the beach was burned down was necessary. It sets up season 2 , but takes a long time in doing so all to simply say there will be more games.One thing that's certain is the show has no issue killing off anyone at any point so it is sure to remain interesting.While I really enjoyed this season , it didn't seem to pull me in as much as Squid Game did.Season 2: I loved this season. It took all of the good parts from the first season and elevated them even higher. Sure there are still some slow parts but you really care for the characters more and more over time. Some of the games are so simple and yet so brilliant.Some of the dialogue is absolutely brilliant. The only issue is that I wanted more of Chishiya. In some ways this character is so strong that it overpowers Arisu. The prison cell game is as good as any game in Squid Game, Hunger Games, and season 1.The conclusion is also really well done. I thought it was about to let me down, but came through huge at the end.Hard to say if there will be a season 3, I would guess not, but I will greatly miss this show, taken altogether it was simply awesome.",9
"I like the actors in this series. Their names are Kento Yamazaki as Arisu, Keita Machida as Karube, Yuki Morinaga as Shota and Asahina Aya as Kuina. My favourite character is Kuina because she can do martial arts and she can also run fast. She was revaled as transgender in some episode. This series is really good it got really open ending so season 2 can look really good and it can surprise us as watchers of this series. I think that some death was unnecessary because some of them was really good characters in this series. I am very exited for season 2 which is coming in december 22th 2022 and u should watch it!",10
"It's so slow, that I barely made it till the idea of the game was revealed, and then it turned out to be the Japanese remake of The Cube with teenage boys. No thanks.Other than that, nicely filmed, the acting seems believable, but the plot is not captivating enough, or should I say anymore, because it has been done before. Main characters who are the players, then you have some expendable characters/players with uninspired and unconvincing dialogue, that obviously have to die in order to explain the rules of the game to the players, much like The Squid Game by the way, cause to the viewer it's already obvious, especially if watched The Cube.",3
"I LOVE THIS SHOW, I LOVE THIS SHOW, I LOOOOOOOVE THIS SHOW.I am a huuuuuuge fan of survival shows/shows wherein you have to survive/do a bunch of mindbending/psychological puzzles to survive and THIS SHOW DELIVERED.I mean if you love Battle Royale then you will love this! I was not sure about this, but I am so glad I started watching it, it is amazing!!! I got hooked from the start and I was excited for each episode. The characters are so good, storyline is brilliant, and I enjoyed every episode. I have many questions but am sure we will get our answers in the next season. Cannot wait for S2! I will definitely rewatch it again :D.",10
"I wish I could go through the list of reasons people disliked this show and debunk each one, but that would take way too long. One thing I will say is there wasn't much that went into Arisu's moment of overcoming the grief of losing his friends. This being said, we can see his resolve is solidified when he makes contact with three men who vaguely resemble the trio he and his friends used to be. There is also where we get to understand Arisu's newly founded intention while carrying onward. Besides the common hero desire to save the world, he stresses that he's determined not to survive by letting others die. It's as if Arisu is compromising with the new reality he is forced to face.",9
"The story's not bad at all. It's kind of a more violent version of Squid Games. I love the apocalyptic/parallel universe aspect. BUT, they are milking some scenes and emotional situations WAY too much. Though I would have still rated it 7 if it wasn't so incredibly misogynistic. The ""strong"" female characters are always somehow reduced to useless degrading moments. For example, Usagi is this strong athletic badass, but somehow can't fight the semi-dying sickly r*pist. I mean come on, how many times did that guy try to r*pe her? The r*pe attempts are just used to objectify her and serve the male gaze. Who still shoots those scenes anyway? Moreover, Arisu is constantly portrayed as her protector although he wouldn't have lasted a day without her. Other women in the show that come up as enemies are also portrayed somewhat weak and less important than their male counterparts.Overall, I would prefer Squid Games. It's not nearly as sexist and also the story doesn't get too distracted by overdramatized lengthy scenes.",4
"The first season of Alice in Borderland is one of the most gruesome and exciting pieces of TV show. For me it is better than Squidgame even it has its flaws.I highly expected to see the sequel but after binge watching, it is still entertaining with higher budget for CG, more blockbuster actions, but it the end the story failed flat. It has nothing exciting anymore, the games seem easier than the first season.The ending is alright but along the way it becomes normal action TV show with very high budget. Anyway I recommended only the first season if you don't have much time.First 8/10
Second 6/10.",7
"Starting of with the screenplay, it's amazing and fast paced.The most engaging element in this series is it's unique Games and it's rules.Simplest yet deadly, loved the premise, looks high budget movie.Acting of actors are pretty good. Especially Protogonist acting is brilliant. Justified the character pretty well.Character build looks original and interesting.Seen the season 2 finale, must say it ended pretty damn well.Background music is awesome and intensifies when an important scene comes up.Good concept, loved it.The Runtime is justified, not felt boried even for a minute.Netflix has done an amazing job with this Series.",8
"I love the manga and read it all
Then when netflix made the series i was afraid they would change it into some political nonsense .. am glad they didnt.Tbh, i like the manga better than the series, however the manga has 60-+ chapters and the series only has 2 seasons. The characters in the series are bit less deep compare to the manga but again, it's acceptable. The ending in manga makes more sense than in the series but i still like it.Again, i cant stress enough that i am glad it respects the source material and not turn it into drag** ball Z disaster.Recommended. Should watch it and also should read the manga. If you live survival theme, u'll love it!",10
"I've just finished the second season and feel compelled to write a review. I am absolutely blown away with every aspect of this show. From character development, metaphors and the most jaw dropping plot line. I never saw it coming in a million years!In season 2, it's just FILLED with action, thrill and just the most gripping storyline. I don't think I've seen a series like this that tied everything so perfectly. This is a masterpiece and my hats off to the creators, the actors and producers. What a series.I only ever leave reviews if I feel a show deserves it. I just had to write something. Thank you for giving the world this gift.",10
"Games are obviously crazy and over-the-top, wish they showed more diamond games (intellectual, so a lot of suspence). Half-open ending is perfect for either finale or renewal, 'inception'-style. Instead of typical korean economy stuff from squid games, there's a lot of morality discussions driven through flashbacks of characters. Unlike squid games, players have no motive to kill each other, except in-game and everybody are scattered around the city, so there is almost no confrontation. And there are practically no villains among main and recurring characters, i liked it a lot. Still, characters in squid games seemed more interesting. Maybe because they have a lot of screen time in the outside world. In the end squid games in my opinion is better but if you're a fan you definitely should watch AIB too.",8
"If the first few episodes of season one are the best ones, than I don't want to know how weak the quality of the other episodes are. I tried the first two and a half episodes of season one but couldn't bring up the will to watch the show any further - there is simply nothing interesting going on that I did not watch already, and better made. The acting is not terrible, but the English dubbing is. I guess the show is more suited to a young audience but if you are beyond your twenties you won't related to any of the characters. The story is also everything but new (as far as I can tell) - a melting of ideas like Cube, Lost and so on but without the suspense, thrill and news. The action is rather generic too. Anyway, production is okay, and I guess if you like to read manga and are heavy into modern Asian movie making you may like this one more than I do. Last word, Squid Games hit me on the right spot and is in my opinion by way superior to Alice in Borderland.",4
"I will preface this by saying, I have tried to read the manga several times and could not for the life of me get into it. The show on the other hand is an entirely different thing.Let's start, the beginning is done well it introduce Arisu and his character while also giving subtle hints about chota and Karube and their life before the games. Ep 1-3 continue with great exposition like this, unfortunately the show is drawn out wayyyy too much as you go further on. Some of the dialogues and scenes of back stories are simply not necessary, many of the monologues are not gripping enough to seem realistic and can easily be shortened into something much more meaningful. Not to mention, Arisu's guilt literally plagues him all the way into season 2 it's almost way to obvious. If the writers made his guilt repressed and took his shame in a different way I think his character could've been a bit more complex but he is only becomes useful at the end of each game. It's a whole lot of running around and ""what do we do? What's going on?"" Before arisu's brain actually work, the more I write the more I realize how useless arisu is in this show ??. He has little to no purpose other than being the one who questions everything and somehow manages to figure out how clear games despite all odds. Usagi, however, has a deeper character than him as she develops and transforms after meeting and knowing arisu. Arisu is a foil character for her, she almost seems like the main character.Moving on to after the 3rd ep, 4-8 was way too long and drawn out I wished they wouldn't have even put the beach plot in there. It's completely useless after season 1 and only serves as aguni's character plot and introducing more characters. And of course even the characters introduced there get their back story but not even have make it out so what's even the point? Yes give a villain a back story but even minor villains? The real enemy is the game masters, tell us more about them. I have watched both s1 and s2 and have learned so little about the game masters and what is real and what isn't. At this point I'm back to square 1.Season 1 ended on a decent cliffhanger but s2 didn't really pick it up in a great way. We wanted to learn more about the games and the game masters but none of the kings or queens would say anything about them so what is the point in questioning ANYTHING about them. Arisu literally begs them to give even the smallest hint and the only response is ""you'll see ??"" like bro what? If their reasoning was oh I'll die if I say anything I'd get that but they literally just wouldn't give a straight answer or even a riddle it was nonsense.What I did like though were the action scenes a lot of the characters looked cool as hell, some of the monologues are decent to listen to, and finally some of the villains are actually gripping with their words. For example if u made it as far as the end of s2, I will say I was hooked in the beginning of Mira's monologue to Arisu unfortunately they lost me at the hospital scene which was too long and dumb as hell.Overall fun show for the weekend but not something top-tier :(. Looking forward to season three.",7
"I have to agree with the reviewers who said this show is more than a bit sexist - Arisu going on about protecting the obviously far-stronger, braver, more stable and more competent Usagi just makes the show look ridiculous.The thing that really irritated me was Usagi using a crutch on the wrong side just so she can be shown leaning on Arisu at the end. Presumably her rehabilitation doctor will have taught her that she should be using the crutch on her weak side, so she had no need to turn Arisu into a giant stick as she left the hospital. Perhaps we should just interpret that as Usagi helping Arisu to feel like he's remotely useful, as she really doesn't need him for anything.I was very disappointed by the directorial choices for the gratuitous r*pe scene too. The guy is coughing up blood! Given what we have seen her do thus far, she could have floored him in ten seconds.Having not read the comics, the show did keep me guessing as to what was going on. (And given the last scene, maybe still guessing... which is good because the S2 ending is rather under-explained as things stand.) I was hooked on some of the games, and I liked the supporting characters. But they should have wasted less time building suspense through Arisu's frustrating levels of inaction and more time building up the back stories for the wider cast. It feels like motivations are just surgically injected with a flashback needle whenever required, and some of the second season antagonists especially could have done with a bit more setup. (Also the supporting characters - what was the payoff for Ann's hike to Yokohama and back, for example?)It's not the artistic achievement that Squid Game was but it's still worth watching for all the good bits - just don't let yourself think too much about all the irritations!",7
"This is not squid games and I don't see the point of comparison just to criticize one show at some aspect that it did better than the other. Both shows are phenomenal.Happy to see season 2 turned out to be so great, because in some series with sequel seasons the quality drops, this is not the case here. My favorite games were Jack of hearts and queen of hearts, it was so unexpected.I was happy to see this development of main characters, questions about the virtues, ideals and freedom that they showed. There really aren't that many shows as interesting as this one, I recommend it to everyone.",10
"Gurl........what happened to season 2 man......Story telling is so lousy in season 2. For me personally, season 1 is 8 points season 2 is only 2 points. I really tried hard to stay focused for first 3 episodes. If u don't care about story line, and just to see ppl mind games then i think it is fine. It gets better in later episodes. However in overall,
S2 doest have much creative games or why they have to play games at first place. Its just Story telling is so disconnected. Also, Cant relate to characters. So much talking. Disappointing. I am not sure there will be season 3, but if there will be , hope they make something more relatable. Perhaps i had too much expectation which led to huge disappointment.",4
It's an interesting idea for a show.Unfortunately the depth of character development is very shallow leaving you uncaring about characters succeeding or failing. This leaves you uncommitted to the plot as you don't really care who lives or who dies. The plot also seems to be very shallow and meandering leaving you confused as to the direction that the program may take. The English dubbing is very very poor and obviously cheap. They could have spent some more money getting better actors to provide the voices. Comparing the show to the squid games is very obvious as they are both coming from the same type of genre. However this show fails to capitalise on the excitement the squid games left viewers wanting more of.,6
"I'm usually a really harsh critic of movies and series in general but this show has absolutely blown me away. This is probably one of the best story writing skills I've seen in a tv series. I loved how unpredictable the show has been since the start. Despite not making a lot of sense in terms of where they were and why everything was happening, the show was extremely addictive to watch. I really enjoyed how they addressed all the potential theories viewers had in season 2. The character development was also noteworthy! Their backstories and how they all relate to one another is also exposed eventually. The best aspect of the show for me was that it has alot more depth to it then you would expect. Truly this show is a work of art for the people who like to read in between the lines and appreciate deeper meaning.",10
"Binge watched season 2.Based on manga graphic novel,
This survival thriller drama has returned
with decent season 2 after 2 years.S2 picks up where S1 left off.Arisu and the gang continue to survive
in a dystopian world consisting
of death games and betrayal, and advances to next level of game.I really enjoyed this season more.It has Cleverly created thrilling games,
good character development,
quick transitions into flashback / back stories of character and present situation,
Good pacing except for last episode,
Easy cliffhangers, convenient plot development,
Good choreographed action n combat scenes
(specially in epi 7),
Decent performances,
Good editing, VFX n visuals.But it took too much time to reach the Climax.I'm happy with the ending.They kept one window open for next season.Over all, I enjoyed it.Total binge-worthy.",8
"Watched the first season and enjoyed it.Season 2 has a good start and a few interesting games as good as the first season.Haven't watched Anime one yet but worth watching it as well,I guess. Disappointing ending and climax is getting a little bit boring.Good flashbacks of each character's real life.Could make ending is more realistic then confuse viewers better. Virtual world will happen one day and make us think more what would be like your life. I expected to be a different ending and more interesting story.But still enjoyable to watch some mind games they went through, pretty clever making those games.",7
"I love this show but I still don't know what's exactly going on. If this show cancels, I will be really disappointed. I believe everything was perfect. The plot, the cast and the cinematography. The games were intense, I had agony in each of them. The cast was likeable. Even the villains had an interest because some were strong and some mysterious. We need a season 3!

It has so many suspenses and twists will keep you wanting more! Have been waiting for this show for a year and now it has turned up the heat! Japanese manga are a work of art! Forget squid game this is how the real games should be!! Excellent and specially the action scenes are a work of art!I loved season one but season 2 follows the same way it left and does not disappoint... love the acting the screenplay and directing.. everything falls perfectly for the viewers to engage and enjoy.. the roles fit perfectly and the games are truly enjoyable and would have never expected it to turn out the way it did.. Enjoy!,10
"Characters are shallow, acting is poor, actors are crying non stop over petty things and for long time, and worst of all, every single piece of action is just not realistic at all. I understand this is fiction, but come on, at least try to make it more relatable. Fighting scenes are too long and unremarkable. Bad guys are slow, clumsy, stupid and without energy. Good guys are the luckiest ever, surfing between the bullets and when injured are able to chill and heal on the streets faster than in a hospital. This would be a nice comedy if characters were not crybabies.As others already pointed out, this tv show is probably for younger, or at least more impressionable, audience.",2
"For me is fare and square the best show out there for this type of life or death games.Good characters, nice story and the games... Oh my god the games....It's the story about 3 friends you are transferred to another world, where they have to play to survive.S2 picks up where the first one ends, with the same intensity and more twisted challenges.The only thing I'm going to spoil it's look for the hearts games, the ones about deception, they are truly a work of a genius.Based on a Manga, it is for me the best of his genre by far.The first episodes are slow but please give at a chance, it's a gem in hidden and needs more recognition.",10
"Omg I really REALLY tried to enjoy it. Looking for silver linings. The premise is fun, kind of cliché but fun. Really poor acting, I don't know if every Japanese TV shows are like this? I don't think so. I waited for something kind of theatrical, but not cringy. Also, it is full of plot holes. Why the main characters who is kind of a genius at the first episode, after many episodes he doesn't show the same skills? Like he forgot everything he knew. The behavior of the characters, or development is not consistent. They make decisions that nobody would in the real world (maybe they are not addressing realism, but still it kind of loses points of fun cause it's not relatable to).It just doesn't make any sense. "" let's play this game that we know nothing about of without discussing what to do, let's everyone do whatever you think is best OK? A plan? Who needs a plan?""And the direction. Pleeeease director stop with the dramatic pauses for dramatic purposes which make no effect at all!!! That resource turns the scenes longer and more boring...",4
"Many answers you were looking for in Season 1, you'll find in season 2. A binge-worthy tv series. Both seasons have 8 episodes each making it possible to binge watch in a few days time. It's a thrill filled Japanese tvseries where people die if they lose a game. It has it's emotional moments and slowly you'll start liking some of the characters and want them to survive.P. S: I personally feel like while squid game was good, this tv series is on a while another new level. Just ignore the negative reviews and give it a try. Must watch tv series. If the starting feels like a bit slow, bear with it...the fruits that lie await will be worth it !",10
"But, there are pretty good characters, an interesting idea. I am not talking about how well it was executed, good enough to watch and enjoy. The most annoying character is Arisu. The guy is that so ashamed to look at women, he is a weak and idiotic character that somehow is always on top. His dramatic crying and always trying to be a hero in situation where he just gotta fight for his life and kill someone who doesn't deserve to be in the world, but he always finds an excuse not to do it, is just annoying as hell. He is an emotional baby that can't accept the new way of living. Every time he cries or do his stupid face reaction like he is struggling, damn it's disgusting. Almost every other character have some reason to fight either on a good or evil side, but Arisu he's just pointless, clueless and totally dumb character. Too many repeatable situations and reactions, it doesn't feel that the character grows, he remains the same person regardless of all consequences and experiences he gets. This is totally out of concept of a role playing games that this tv show tries to represent. I would love to see his character to get mature and less emotional, especially of what he got through.",5
"Season 2 has a very good transition to the previous season. It's not always full of action - which annoys some others - there are also quiet moments to enjoy before the next game of life or death moves on.Compared to a film, there isn't the classic curve that keeps building up, but there are always flattenings, which in my opinion, makes the whole thing even more intense.Season 2 is even more fun to put myself in the scenario of how I would make decisions but also to think out of the box and think about what would be the decisions of the others.I'm not someone who switches off and lets pure violence affect me. I want to think and reflect and season 2 did it even better than season 1.Of course, some action scenes are exaggerated, but you know that from every film/series.The connection to the characters is well done and even if you don't see yourself in the protagonists, it's interesting to know that there is always someone who feels like they have a mirror in front of them.The actors - as well as voice actors - are well chosen.",9
"Deserves the hype that Squid Game later received. Unorthodox and unprepareable, often cruel, situations brought on by some god's sick sense of humour contrast with the good and bad of humanity which bring this series to life. Recommended.Synopsis:
An aimless gamer and his two friends find themselves in a parallel Tokyo, where they're forced to compete in a series of sadistic games to survive. It covers the Borderland Games' first phase with the arrival of the players and the completion of the Spot Card Games.An aimless gamer and his two friends find themselves in a parallel Tokyo, where they're forced to compete in a series of sadistic games to survive.

"This must be the best netflix series I've watched to date. Again, people know that this is better than Squid Game. People who are giving this lower review don't know quality series. Each episodes are tense, action and acting are superb. This show really deserves a Season 3.There are lot of lessons you will learn. There are lot of scenes that will move you. There are lot of games you will enjoy to watch. There are lot of characters you will love from start til the end.How sad this doesn't get the awards it deserves?Anyway, lot of 6 or 7 star-rating are sometimes way better than the 8 or 9 overrated series right. That explains it. These days, anything can be manipulated. Awards, reviews and almost everything. Let's just judge it on our own taste and be happy on what we are watching.For me, this show is 10/10!",10
"Oh dear lord, I see people saying it goes downhill from episode 4 onwards, but I haven't even made it there. So much unnecessary filler scenes and cliche dramatization. None of the wit, outsmarting opponents, or breaking the game that I would expect from the genre. This is just gore.Some say the games are interesting. I don't see what's so interesting about hide and seek, where everyone besides the catcher dies. Of course, the main character happens to be the catcher, and some lame drama happens. Just seems like a pretty convenient way to kill off everyone except the main character. Not sure what's so interesting about tag with machine guns either.So disappointing.",1
"A manga or comic book adapted live action series. 2 seasons of 50 minutes to 1+hr series. Falls in action, adventure, horror, thriller, fantasy, scifi and family categories. Despite the family category, its not much of a family friendly series as it full with horrofic scenes for adults. Its about several groups of people stuck in limbo (a world between life and death), surviving every day in that world by participating in a death match to extend their stay until beating the leaders so that they can escape to the real world without knowing the reasons behind all the misery & losses.Season 1 was okay for me and not much of a fan since the storyline was not fully followed the manga/comic book. Meanwhile, season 2 was the best as it was faithful to the comic till the end. Although i felt it was rushed but the graphics and acting skills of the casts were tremendously improved since the previous season. Great audio and action scenes. New amazing line of casts and huge improvements on the previous main casts. Some parts were tearjerking, some games were exciting to be watched on bigger screen. Exceed my expectations, hence its one of my favorite show of the year 2022. Highly recommended.",8
The series is absolutely good but are really more violence scene but it's really enjoyable. The acting was perfect. The screenplay is amazing.you should definitely give a try.Have a good day:),9
"If you're a fan of zombie show and won't care about the quality/plot or any details - sure go for it.Also if you're new to Korean shows and want to watch something go ahead
However, if you're someone who watches shows for the plot, direction, cinematography, stunts then I'd say this one was so disappointing.It looked great when the trailer was out. I was actually excited but the show is below average for me. The camera work was sloppy. Looks like it was shot way back in 2000 or the techniques they used were quite outdated not sure about that (still there were good shows with good quality before 2000s. So clearing that )
Background score is really not appropriate - it doesn't sync with most of the scenes. Usually Koreans shows have amazing OST's or background scores.The plot is terrible - Same typical plot (both school/zombie) there's nothing new plus they tried to fit everything in the plot that it felt more of a school drama than zombie school drama
This may be a low budget show but still I've seen better shows with low budget!Anyway all I want to say is rather than watching this show and wasting time on it. Please watch Happiness (its of same genre but the plot is amazing - overall an epic show ) and thank me later ??
This is coming from a person who watched countless number of Korean shows and is tired of basic plots - so don't be offended if you liked the show. Since, most of the reviews are misleading to someone like me I just wanted to put it out there.",5
There are many zombie movies already for us. But it is simply superb....??wonderful acting.. not a slow start at all....must give a try for to this fabulous series... And it gonna be a best series like sucide squad....,10
"Nobody does Zombie like the Koreans. The moves, the story, the acting all top notch.Train to Busan is one of my favourite zombie films of all time and this series is going to be one of my favourites too10/10.",10
"Just finished watching the first episode (the series got released today). Started out with interesting character development and story building. One thing I like, and perhaps what may make this series different from other zombie series/movies, is that it tries to establish the similarities between domination of certain sections of people over the others in our society and dominant / invasive nature of parasites/viruses over other living organisms, irrespective of intelligence, consciousness or any other things.Will have to see how the rest of the series turns out to be. Hope it turns out to be another critically acclaimed Korean series, among so many others.",9
This movie is really good i like zombie movies only few seasons are good this season one of tham all actor all story are very good and also very decent production.,10
"What was that?? I'm completely amazed, bruh.Ignore the bad reviews already. Just watch it for ur own fun.It's Gory, and I loved it. Watched the first 5 episode. And it's a good run.This is a good series in the zombie franchise.Must watch.Gumawo.",10
"This serie is clearly an adaptation of Highschool of the dead Manga series which sadly stopped. After the first couple of episodes I like it a lot, the acting is very good. Zombies are superb as you might expect from Korean Zombie genre.",8
So far it's been a generic plot. Nothing happening other than people turning into zombies.5/10 coz I haven't watched it in entirety.Waste of time tbh.,4
They overrated the drama the series was just crying and surviving i guess this is korean drama it's not interesting or the story so ridiculous kids can make better zombie series better than this.,6
"After watching so many zombie movies and series, this one doesnt have anything new and exciting to offer. The characters have no depth and the scenes are predictable and not believable. All of the episodes are just endless acrobats and running around. It such a shame because some of the actors are actually good.",6
"Too excited for this show and maybe that was why I was disappointed. Non stop watched to ep. 3 trying to get into the storyline and characters, and although it gets better after each episodes, both storyline and characters so far are unremarkable. Too many holes in the plot, timeline all wrong.. Some of the main characters are so annoying that I rooted for the zombies.Nevertheless, the zombies are great and it is definitely entertaining so I would grudgingly finish watching this.",6
"The story is very generic, predictable and monotonous. There isn't much going on except for a few scenes of violence. The zombies are okay, the humans are as dumb as you can expect them to be in a zombie movie, I would say even dumber than most movies. They fight among themselves, they have a tendency to exhibit wisdom after the event. Their actions don't make any sense at all. All in all, this is a very long and tedious watch. Don't waste your time like I did.",4
Koreans really know how to make a zombie flick!Great character building and introduction of the different plotlines.Two episodes in and it's mayhen and chaos all over the school!As you go on more characters and different situations are presented and it all unfolds perfectly.It is really well paced and non-stop action. A dramatic scene here and there but not too much to get you bored.Freaky zombie outbreak like I've never seen before (only in Train to Busan).I can't wait to see how it all plays out.,8
"They were so calm when there is a zombie outbreak happening and some of them aren't even showing fear.. I thought at first that maybe their mind just went blank because of what was happening, but as it goes on they're still showing blank expressions. It's really disappointing to be honest.",2
"I was hoping like everyone if the series is of same universe as of train to busan but it isn't, this series is so dumb and cringe and just like anyother horror or zombie movie, characters instead of running away from fear runs towards it, everything looks so annoying that I couldn't watch it,just horrible.",2
"I've read webtoon ""All of us are dead (Now at our school)"" right after watching the trailer of this show. It wasn't a lengthy comic with a heavy conversation, so it was easy to turn to the next chapters. I'm not a fan of the style of the comic, but it was still fun and intense. I'm in the 5th episode right now, and so far I've felt the show adapted the original webtoon quiet well which is why I wanted to write a review about it. However, I get to see these assumptions of promoting High school of the dead from the comments which is not okay seriously. I also watched High school of the Dead long time ago. All I can remember is that the anime was more about female body images rather than zombies and stuff. Plots and characters in both shows, there's no any similarity between the two. The only similar aspect is they both use high school students as main characters. Honestly, Is there anime that doesn't use high school students as main characters? Seriously, google High school of the dead anime, and watch it on youtube, you'll get the idea within 2 minutes. I would not recommend to watch it with female companions or friends though. Back to the show, All of us are dead, it's well made, and it adopted the original story very well.Update: I ended up watching the whole series for 2 days. It's worth it just as other positive reviewers say. It's well paced, and mixed with good actions. Also it created a different type of zombie.",8
"Central to the plot is a horrific theme of constant and brutal bullying, which is not only disturbing, miserable and frustrating to watch, but is the least creative subplot conceivable for a high school drama. I can't imagine how anyone could muscle through a viewing of the whole season, but I intend to spare myself the pain of a second episode.",1
"It's the first time I am going to write a review without finishing a season of a series but this deserves it! If you are a zombie fan then stop reading and start watching! It is amazing it has everything you want - lots of action, gore, likable characters and hundreds of zombies..I don't want this season to finish! Well done Netflix bring more series like this!",9
"If you're looking for some 'Train to Busan' kind of horror or action, then walk away because the movie isn't for you.Not every zombie movie or show has to have the same storyline; it can either be funny like ""Zombieland,"" serious like ''World War Z' or be in the form of a TV series like ""The Walking Dead.""It depends on your preferences. Speaking of ""All of Us are Dead,"" it's a decent watch if you're into survival genre and you have nothing else to watch at the moment.In addition to that,
1. It's based on a popular webtoon
2. The effects are good
3. It's only 12 episodes, unlike some TV series with 16 plus.",7
"Absolutely amazing. One of the best Korean drama. It hits much harder when you come to the realization that a pandemic is already going on and we are helpless. This drama gives hope and tells what friendship means and how far one can go to take revenge. It's a complete mix of thrill, horror, drama and cute romance.",10
"Happiness (2021) is also a Zombie Kdrama, except it's not. It focuses on the human aspect of survival in a way to try and present itself as unique. It tries to show us that humans are worse than zombies, except the writing is absolute garbage because the basis of each episode is a character making a dumb decision and then the two main protagonists having to fix that dumb decision. That is not how you create plot! That show falls into every zombie pitfall trope possible.Now All os Us are dead on the other hand is amazing. If you want to see how cruel humans can actually be to one another, this is the show, especially after episode 3. Good cast of characters, great action, great plot, great sfx makeup and average cinematography. However if you're watching this show for film making techniques you've come to the wrong place.",9
"It was all a hype. I first saw the webtoon but i didnt bother to read it so when i learned that they will make it a series, i was excited. Welll the story isnt interesting at all. ?? u watch these students make annoying dialogues and most of the scenes are dead or okay to be removed since they do not mean anything to the plot. I skipped a lot of dialogues because it is truly a waste of time. To be fair, the first few episodes are good but the rest is literally to make it long. Imo, they shouldve just made it into a movie.",3
Some of the characters were a little annoying and the romantic interests felt just a bit silly and somewhat ill fitting given it's an apocalyptic scenario. I felt it was aimed at a predominantly teen audience and that it was really quite laboured with not a great deal happening given that it was over 11 hours of TV. It could easily have been done in 8 episodes. Those criticisms aside it was otherwise reasonably entertaining.,7
I only watched 2 episode right now ...guys its awsome its not serious like TWD.but its not funny as ZOMBOAT...trust me you will like it even you are not ZOMBIE fan .....,10
"This series is really amazing wait for 2nd season. This is one of the greatest series in netflix and also korea .I am really surprised and So many congratulations all of cast and all of us Dead,s members.",10
"Over 12 hours for a zombie story!!!!! God it gets boring and repetitive after initial 2-3 episodes. After that it is just counting how different people becomes zombie and keep counting bodies. Too many subplots and hell lot of characters, unnecessary drag.",1
Actors who portrayed Cheong San and Nam Ri as well as the adults were able to deliver but some were totally lacking especially the one who played On Jo.Storyline is meh. Tried to tackle a bit too much that audience would not feel much empathy towards the characters.Good zombies make up though.,4
"? Easy plot but the storyline compensates it as a whole
? Gore effects
? Lead roles (males) and the class president's acting
? Properly executed but its very predictable twists and cliché
? Mind blowing scientific explanation on how it (zombies) started? Character build up
? Slow start
? Some loopholes like people are aware that they are zombies but they don't know how to kill them and etcetera
? Female lead roles' action skills
? Ending can be a lot better (I think); a different cliff hanger, maybe. Why would they go back to the same place where they barely survived even if its for a good purpose???? Because of plot armor
It could've been 8, however, I find some unnecessary conversations which doesn't add up to the storyline. Its just there to make the episode longer. ??Add ons:I know this is a fiction however the reason why I don't like the ending is because, in a fiction called Hunger Games: Catching Fire, no one would like to play the games for the 3rd quarter quell because it can mean death, again.Train to Busan and Kingdom is very, very good that's why it somehow shattered my expectations specially from the trailer.I can't also help but to compare it to Highschool of the Dead, it is shorter but a lot of things happened (I can let this go because I have to consider the pandemic which limits resources and locations.)",7
"Upon seeing reviews, I've watched it. There's no interesting content. It has the same old zombie plot. Train to busan was a lot better compared to this.",1
I do love watching anything Korean and zombies thrown into the mix was a bonus I really enjoyed it was was glued to the TV all day. Ignore the negative comments and give it a try and then decide for yourself. ????,10
"They just scape of the dead using doors and windows against the zombies..., everyone is screaming and eating each other alive..., they are covered in blood....And the only thing that they do is to talk about date each other.Yes I lost 2h of my life watching and they will not came back.",1
"The shows bring nothing new compared to other zombies tv shows/movies. I'm 4 episodes into it and it's really slow, the characters are so cliches and the whole thing is boring.",6
"Such a cliché plot and unlikable characters. The series doesnt offer anything new. If you have watched any other x zombie movie this one is exactly the same no taste weak plot, weal characters.",1
"Started pretty well, but that posh b@#*# in the pink top just ruined the whole show for me...Too bad as it seemed to be unique even if it is a zombie movie.",7
I love zombie flicks! From low budget to no budget to good budget productions. And I couldn't wait after seeing the 'This will blow you away' postings on social media. I decided to set aside the evening and binge watch it. But it was just disappointing. Are people so starved for anything zombie related these days that mediocre passes for mind blowing? I'm not sure. But I only made it a few episodes in before tuning out.,4
"They set up the story with played out tropes without any original take on them (bullies and high-teen drama), and social commentary aspect takes over the believability of the story.",2
"Yes -- I see you.This series was awesome.One of the better zombie movies for sure. It's not one of those blunt zombie movies where people get eaten alive. The movie touches upon real societal issues, youth violence & crime, and class division. There are only handful of zombie outbreak movies out there that can even compare.Ugh so much blind hate.",10
"All of us are dead is extremely graphic and disturbing than you may expect. Squeamish people... don't even try. People who want an edge-of-the-seat entertainment and can handle lavish gore... you guys are in for a ride.Each episode delivers and even though they're a bit longer than usual, they don't feel tedious. When there's no mayhem, there are the character conflicts, thus making every episode as gripping as possible.The characters are horror flick typical but they're smart and resourceful- okay maybe some foolish decisions here and there but hey they're still high school students! Seeing them come up with clever escape gimmicks is always the most fun part, as well as seeing them build trust between each other.Cinematography is fine with some striking and ominous frame shots. Sound effects are impressive and detailed (with lots and lots of squelching lol). And the zombie transformation scenes - no matter how repetitive they get - always look pretty insane!The cast are fantastic and everyone shines. I love that they're actually young actors cast as high schoolers (Hollywood take some notes!).Overall, All of us are dead succeeds at being grim, comedic, and emotional all at the same time. Definitely a neat addition to the zombie/survival genre. Looks like another Netflix hit from South Korea.8/10 worth the 12 hours.TW: Bullying / Sexual harassment / Suicide.",8
Mind blowing series.this series blow my mind to their beauty their story their characters and their connection to my heart. Must watch this series.Who watched squid game definitely you should watch this series you will love it . I'll again watch this series.And also i want to tell you i finished this series in 12 hour non stop.,10
"It's thrilling and fun. In particular, after Kyung-soo turned into a zombie, he was able to immerse himself in the drama. My time melted gently. I was deprived of time. I'm sure you feel the same way.",10
"Only 4 episodes in, its very dramatic but fun moments and zombie attacks everywhere, gonna keep continue watching this, any zombie lover and korean series watchers would love this one.",9
"It's not a terrible show . But seriously , how can they make these characters so idiotic . The girl that killed the classmate with the cloth was one of the worst characters I've ever seen in a show. I nearly had to stop watching after her first few scenes. Then we get to the character on the roof that can hear them talking on the other side of the door then tells the Blackhawk soldiers with guns that there's no one left ? Like seriously , even in a life and death situation , no one would ever do something like that . It's absolutely ridiculous. The people at rotten tomatoes giving this show 100% must not have brains, cuz it would be impossible to give this show a 10/10.",4
"I'm a huge fan of the zombies genre and this is was just horrible. It had so much potential, it could've been another Battle Royale theme but with zombies. I guess we got spoiled with Kingdom and Train to Busan. As mentioned in the other reviews, the dialogue drags and it doesn't go anywhere. The kids were so annoying I was literally hoping they would all die so the series would end. The worse is when they all just stand there while watching their friends get killed or watching one of them fight off a slew of zombies. Poorly developed storylines and characters. I can't believe there are 12 episodes to this disappointing mess. I stopped in the middle of 5 and I should've cut my losses after 2.",3
Amazing series worth to watch its an interesting series with lot of emotions and fun i really enjoyed it. Forget about bad reviews just go for it.the actors acting is also really good i hope they will make season two of this.i know that koreans never disappoint us while making these type of contents.the visual effects are also really good......,10
"Maybe because i've seen kingdom and sweet home, i was expecting something more. There are unnecessary scenes that contribute nothing to the plot. Added sexuaI violence scene of a minor that wasn't in the original webtoon, filmed in a way that was no different from p*rnography.",1
"This series just feels so real, and everything happened in it can be convincingly happening in real life, this is what most zombie series are lack of. And another thing this series is good at is the action scenes, they really did a great job.All characters in this drama is depicted well, with their distinct personalities, even those characters that only appeared once or twice. The main characters also got distinct personalities and each of the acted very well, that's what we need for a zombie drama, because a zombie drama without deep character development can be pure brainless entertainment with lot's of gore and violence only.There're also shortcomings in this series, especially in mid sections of this drama, everything gets a little boring, however, the plot is getting more and more attractive as the plot goes on, and it can still hook audiences without much action scenes involved.Overall, this series is a great zombie series with great action scenes, and a decent plot with deep character development, it's a zombie series with good production value.",10
"What was that?? I'm completely amazed, bruh.Ignore the bad reviews already. Just watch it for ur own fun.It's Gory, and I loved it. Watched the first 5 episode. And it's a good.",10
"This is a decent zombie flick. High school students tried to survive a zombie outbreak at their school. Of course, it would not be a young adult flick without love stories, friendship stories, bromance and .... bullying. You would expect that, wouldn't you?!One thing I would like to add for future zombie script writers. Zombie movies have been around since 1978, so the terms zombie outbreak and its symptoms are not an unknown thing to people nowadays. But every zombie movies always begin with an outbreak that looks like nobody know what it is or what to do. Please, next time write a zombie flick which the protagonists are aware of it and know what to do about it. It would be a refreshing story.Worth watching 8/10.",8
Very well-paced! It was interesting to see zombies all over the school. I couldn't keep my eyes off as the story unfolded.It was so much fun! Trust me.. you will love this series.,10
AOUAD is great zombie survival show though it borrows many elements from other manga's (like sweet home) and train to busan but it is really original. Forget high school of the dead thats pure echhi. But this is really thrilling survival horror show. Cinematography and direction is good. Zombies are scaries. Show isn't predictable and ending is not that good. Cliffhangers are bad but action makes it all for it. If you liked this i recommend read SWEET HOME webtoon. A must watch for people coming in zombie genre.,8
"The friendship and their loyalty was the best thing that the show represents. When it comes to movie between life and death and you want the actors to make the best decision instead of irritating and selfish ones well this is it.Ive never been so satisfied with the characters and their decisions. Their loyalty, love, perseverance and tolerance. Each character brings so much presence in their own right.On the plus side. Park Solomon is easy on the eyes. And so are the rest. But he shines like never before.",9
It has everything zombies friendships romance bombing a total city as last resort all in one a fun watch don't miss it. Its around 11 hours long so watch it in 2 days !,9
"3 episodes in, I have to say I'm enjoying it.Yes it's not perfect at all;whenever someone is transforming in a zombie, people just stare and stay still. While there's enough time to take action like throw him/her out of a window or bash its skull. Rather than doing that they just watch and start running when the zombie has fully transformed. I could understand that the first time. But after the same person has seen more than 10 zombie 'transformations', and still does not take action and is surprised the zombie then launches at them, you start to wonder how stupid they actually are...CGI doesn't look to good when there is action involved like a zombie launching itself at someone.Saying that, I have to admit really enjoying this show. It's well acted, well written, sometimes even original and overall it's just tons of fun.A solid 7 for me.",7
"I don't know what to say I'm speechless but this is a very amazing show love it. I love every part of it,I love the entire episodes so cool..??
Hope in season 2 would be very scary! I'm excited.Great show???? keep it up.",10
"The character is not special enough to like.-For me, the atmosphere in the movie is not attractive, maybe the length is too long.-There are a lot of scenes that are a bit awkward.-There are a lot of boring dialogues.Old content but not more advanced.-Quite long for entertainment.*Other than that, the action scenes are fine.",3
"I finished watching this before giving this review. But tbh......This is a very disappointing zombie movie. I just waste my time, I should stop watching this after 3episodes.Tho the zombie's makeup/effects are nice.",3
But ...I have complained that why in every zombie series/movie main character is die at end and it is very emotional moment......................................................,10
A Korean high school is the epicentre for a virus which turns the students into flesh eating zombies. The story centres around a small group of students and their attempt to survive as they are continually hunted. It is well acted and it tells the stories of the good and bad pupils which the zombies do not differentiate from when they mindlessly attack. It has plenty of individual introspection as friends and family fall victim and although not the best storyline each episode does enough to hold your interest for the whole series to discover the outcome.,7
This was the best zombie webseries i watched untile now and i expect more. Like this .zombie scene in high school was awsome. I was imagening what would i do if was in their position.,9
"They are staring zombies. I got bored from the long stares. They are zombies!! What are you looking? Just run! Not good enough, i am disappointed. Why 7.8? Interesting rating!",3
I actually find it quite slow and boring. I am on episode 4 now but going to skip a few. Maybe something will happen instead of every episode the same.,3
"I watched it in a single go.Its gory and fun to watch with amazing plot point.I loved how Lee Byeong Chan created the virus in order to save his son, but failed in creating a vaccine, and how it all started with a simple lab rat.",9
"All of Us Are Dead is South Korea's latest entry into its esscalating body of undead mayhem (Train to Busan, #Alive, Happiness).All of Us Are Dead pulls no punches and unleashes a savage and seemingly never-ending assault of fast-running zombies on an unfortunate squad of students who've managed to survive the first wave of a zombiecalypse. With 12 episodes running 1 hr long each, it gets a bit exhausting at times due to continuous gore and violence, yet it sticks to the basics and delivers a positive outcome, although there's nothing new.All of Us Are Dead's zombie action is never not impressive. Whether it's giant chaotic crowd shots, massive ensemble brawls, or tricky ""oners,"" this is massively kinetic storytelling that will drain you as emotionally as it drains our heroes physically. Likewise, there are dozens of instances involving astounding body acting.All of Us Are Dead may not offer up anything exactly new in the realm of zombie carnage other than its somewhat cruel and unrelenting nature, but sometimes that's enough to pull off some damn effective survival horror.My Rating : 7.5/10.",7
"If you want to slap your forehead every five minutes, this series helps you maintain the rhythm. I'm used to characters in horror movies and series making idiotic decisions, I really am, but this takes it to a whole new level. If this series tried to mock the stupidity of most horror flicks, it would be a fun little series, but unfortunately it tries to be serious. What a waste of time and brain cells. I don't understand the high ratings, but to each their own I guess.",3
Looking forward for season 2. The story goes on fast not boring at all. I enjoy it despite some part that bugged me. Some Character's actions are little bit annoying ie. Screaming so loud and keep standing/staring while zombies are coming. And the bad guy got zombie blood in his mouth since beginning(in school canteen) why hes not a zombie?,7
"I always loved watching korean zombie movies and very hopeful while watching this trailer. But I'm so disappointed with this series! I think this is the worse korean zombie I have ever seen. From storyline to the action and movement of the zombie.Don't waste your time watching this series, or if you want to watch it try one or two episodes and you'll know.",3
"If you enjoy watching Zombie stories ,definetly worth to see this show,i really enjoyed,great acting also funny moments,i do recommend it ,korean people ,you know how to do zombie stories and the best make up !",7
This thing is actually pretty slow and boring until episode 3 then the pace really picks up and things start to get interesting. So if you are looking for quick action then skip to episode 3 or the middle of episode 2. I'm now at episode 6 and it's actually pretty interesting now.,8
I think most bad reviews are from those new Korean drama watchers after squid game. Korean drama and films are always known to have a slow character build up. As it's essential to get to know a character. Having said that yes it's annoying at times with these kiddish behaviour however these are teenagers after all. Regardless I would watch Korean zombies any day. Great show and great entertainment ??,9
"It is a film that has found value enough to want to write a review despite having to use a translator.Like a Korean drama, the sophisticated film technique and detail stood out.What makes this film more valuable is that it tries to deal with the problems of human society.It shows the gap between the rich and the poor among students in the school, bullying among students, and the selfishness of human beings through it.In a situation where zombies spread throughout the city, the attitudes of each person involved also show the brutality and dignity of human beings at the same time.I feel that this drama asks us a lot of philosophical questions and I want to give it a big score.Through nonstop action, the eyes are not boring, the romance between students is well expressed, and the friendship between people move us.I don't give it a full score because of the boring parts in between, but I recommend this drama.",9
"Imo I thought the first episode was a bit slow to get to the zombie outbreak and boy was I happy when it did.I find how the virus was made a little interesting, nothing mind blowing, but interesting. I think the only thing that gets me are the points where the writing is dumbed down so the plot can move forward. The best moment I can think of is when a kid calls the authorities. I sat there and repeated ""please don't be stupid and say ""zombies are attacking students at my school""."" and then the student brings up Train to Busan, which you should watch if you haven't yet. So far this is a good zombie series.Some points off for writing and pacing but still good.",8
"I like the start of this show very much, it got me very hooked that I finished the first 7 episodes in one go and some of those plots are convincing and heartbreaking at the same time. While not all of the protagonists' actions are sensible and enjoyable to watch, they are somewhat reasonable and if anyone got pushed to a corner, it could happen to anyone, so I'm not judging those actions at all (at least at first). Here are some the highlights as well as some problems I find that are hard to swallow and potentially can break the audience out of the show.1. I love the plot where Lee Na Yeon intentionally poisoned Nam So Ju, although the outcome is very heartbreaking, and I really hated her character at that moment. What the teacher said later is really thought provoking, the teacher apologised to Na Yeon that it's the teacher's fault to let the other students corner Na Yeon. It got me thinking, if I or any other people were in her shoe, where the world was turned upside down, and the only people around you all turned against you because you said something terrible when you were desperate and scared. While she could have apologised to So Ju and that would be a great outcome, but as a teenager and when she felt she was being cornered when she didn't even do anything wrong (in her view), it was understandable as people can do terrible things when they feel they are cornered. And as a teacher, as a grown up, the best way is sometimes not to stand to one side, because one side is right and the other is wrong, but to understand both sides and make sure both sides can talk it out and work on their differences. While at that moment, Na Yeon did seem to be the very eval character we just wish to get rid of, the world is never black and white, and people are not perfect and will make mistakes and say terrible things. And the later scene where Na Yeon was smiling at her classmates' video recording shows she does indeed have feelings toward her classmates, not ""I don't care about any of you"" when she said that, and she even made the resolve to walk past all of the infected to deliver food and drinks to her classmates at last shows she has a good side as well.2. Protagonists pretty much weren't affected by dehydration and hunger when they barely had anything to drink and eat somewhat feels unreal, but I suppose the show wants to focus on the human side rather than survival side.3. This show is about fast Zombies, and protagonists survived several waves of those attacks and even attempt to retrieve a cell phone in a wave of zombies is somewhat questionable. I do understand the urge to get help, but this action would be suicidal if they didn't have the plot armour on them.4. The superhuman zombie mutation with consciousness setting is very annoying and show breaking, it's understandable to have immunity towards it (arguably serves better plot purpose), but come on, super strength, heal automatically, never dies, they can do better than that.5. In later episodes, the show is clearly eager to get rid of more characters, as the decisions they make no longer make sense, and the death feels hollow and scripted. The father who escaped shootings with a minor scratch from soldiers with auto rifles, somehow intentionally want to sacrifice himself when he didn't need to. I mean come on, if you really wanted your daughter to survive, the best thing is to be at her side as you are strongest fighter and survival expert in the group? But instead, after successfully distracted waves of zombies, and there was clearly a room for escape, he choose to fight with those zombie and somehow got bit. Now this circles back to the superhuman mutation problem, if the person can be asymptomatic after bit, surely you don't just eagerly throw yourself and sacrifice yourself while you could wait it out to see if you are asymptomatic or not?6. Bad ending that wasted many opportunities laid by the previous plot.",8
"It contains many issues that Korea has. I couldn't stop thinking about Sewol Ferry when kids were not saved by their own country and it broke my heart. I think the plot is great but it could have been much better with writing, acting and editing.",7
"It's a disgusting series A lot of blood, and used concept.If it was in 2012 it would have been much better.I wish they came up with a new idea.///////////////",1
Only on episode 3 and already hooked this is brilliant.Everything is so good about this show. Its so freaking scary love it!This show is so good that anyone who likes horror should watch it.,10
"I really think it an excellent zombie TV series. On Douban, an app in China, used to comment on movies or TV series, etc, many people said that it is not so good, even a bad zombie TV series. I totally can't understand it. They think Onjo is too silly. They think the best choice for Onjo is to kill her best friend immediately after they found out that she was infected. I mean, they are just high school students, and she is Onjo's best friend. When the memories between them showed in Onjo' mind, I can't help crying. She was used to be my best friend. How could she be infected??!! I think what Onjo acted is realistic. That's what a normal people would do at that situation, and not just kill her without mercy. So I am quite disappointed about the rate on Douban, just 6.3/10. However, the rate on imdb makes me realize that there are people who use their brain to watch this TV series.",9
"I really like zombie story and I have been watched or read a lot of them. I was really excited with this series when it was coming on netflix, so I decided to watch it as soon as possible. The first episode, I thought it would be a 'different' zombie story but too bad, it doesn't go like that. They missed a lot of details. The cafetaria scene was the worst scene in this series. Gyeong Su turned into a zombie because his scar was infected by zombie's blood, but the other characters who fighting with zombies weren't infected with zombie's blood even they have some scars on their body. It just one of them, when you're more, you will get some ridiculous moment that is not make sense on your logic. It's still fun to watch tho, but don't expect it too much ??",6
"This show was a major disappointment for me mostly for two reasons- annoying characters and forced plot.The characters are so fcking annoying and they lacked enough complexity. I know they are teenagers. Still the writers could have added more depth to their personality.The plot seemed extremely forced- a genius dude wanted to help his son fight against his bullies and ended up creating this zombie virus. It seems a bit abnormal for my sake. The bully surviving even after getting bitten (Though it's explained that some people would turn into half-zombies after contacting the virus) also seemed extremely forced to me. It seemed like the writers did everything to save him for the final fight. I've seldom seen someone getting this much plot armour.Some other reasons for me disliking this show are- lack of a complex villain (the bully was trying to murder people for no proper reason at all), zero to no use of gun to make the zombies seem op (Cops fighting against zombies using shields was so painful to watch).",4
"I'm about half-way through the season. The show has some flaws, it's not perfect. Nothing is. Expecting this to be a flawless masterpiece is unrealistic and just being an entitled a&&hole.But really, this is a great entry into the zombie canon so far. I think they are doing some really creative things and trying to have some fun at the same time. The pacing is good, the soundtrack is good. They're thinking big-picture about some of the problems that would be encountered and totally Train to Busan-ing ways to solve those problems.Yes, characters sometimes make stupid decision. But honestly, is it realistic for high school kids in ""real life"" to suddenly become apocalypse masterminds as soon as zombies prove to be real and start attacking? Would it be realistic for everyone, even adults, to know the perfect strategy and what to do every time in an intense situation like this? C'mon. Gimme a break.Of course they're not always going to do the smart thing. That's called being a teenager. That's called being HUMAN.This show is taking a balls-to-the-wall stab at doing some fresh with the genre while still respecting the canon that's come before. It's fun to watch. It's also got emotional depth and some real to say under it all.Watch it, eat some popcorn.",8
"And... I have seen a lot. The thrill and action with which this series kept me latched to episode after episode - I loved it.The cast did great acting, became a fan of a few actors. Screenplay was amazing, editing was crisp, the zombies were believable (quintessential zombies) and it is worth a second season. I hope to see the characters again.Great job team ""all of us are dead""",10
I usually love zoombie themed dramas/movies because of the intense scenes but this was just too cliche and boring. Most importantly I hated almost EVERY character! They just too stupid I cant believe most of them made it so far.,3
"I totally love these South Korean series. They are inventive, beautifully made and fun. And there is always a subtle, gentle and tender message. Yes it's a zombie serie but it is somehow sweet. Actors are great and very likeable and direction is brilliant full of inventive touches.BUT..please,please,please find some decent English speaking dubbing actors and translators. These are absolutely painful.",10
"Darn this was so amazing
It was so thrilling!! Ofc it's the same old plot about zombies attacking people and biting but what makes its really good is legit EVERYTHING -
Like the character interaction, what all they did for survival and how they saved themselves. The series had people betraying others which made me really mad and frustrated. But it also had amazing characters who sacrificed themselves. The entire acting is amazing and i never got bored. I've been super hyped about it ever since the trailer came and after watching it didn't dissapoint me!! It made me feel soo conflicted and so sad. Really good and worth the hype.",10

"The serie is quite fun to watch but it doesn't bring anything new or special, unfortunately because sometimes these kind of movies from South Korean production companies can be a hidden gem (i.e. Train to Busan). However, it is really a South Korean zombie production so if you don't like that, don't bother to watch it. However, it doesn't meet the level of TWD but it definitely is much better than FTWD.For those who love South Korean zombie production, All of Us are Dead is worth to watch. Sometimes it is a bit annoying and slow that you start to wonder whether you are watching a highschool serie. However, I binged it in a weekend and I kinda got into the main characters of the serie. I just hope that Netflix won't kill this serie and that it will order a 2nd season as the story got potential for another interesting zombie season.",8
"I had high hopes for this one, but I am disappointed after watching one episode. The scriptwriter had to make the characters act so stupidly and make a bunch of dumb decisions so the story could go on. The storyline is cliche and not believable. The only positive thing I can say about this is they are trying to raise awareness of bullying, which is a common issue in Korean society.",1
"I am enjoying the show. I think Koreans know how to make a zombie movie or a show. I binge watched it entire Saturday and watched 9 episodes in a row. But since I need to sleep, I will watch the rest (3 episodes the next day, Sunday 30th Jan)",10
"Its about choices, ethical dilemmas, power, helplessness, politics, bullying, principles and about what makes life worth living.I found the series to be ok, some of the very typical Korean fat shaming, dumb shaming and self worth through societal achievements, but I guess it comes with the territory.I find it quite weird that there isn't a whole legion of people complaining and calling it woke. Guess they hid it well enough with splatter and gore.Then again most Zombie movies are about us and choices.",7
"This series has been pulled unnecessarily into 12 long bad episodes. Extremely slow, and cliche acting and storyline. Some of the actors are so bad, they literally have zero reaction even after seeing a zombie...lol. Does not live up to the over hyped trailers...sigh.",1
Overall it was a good drama ...... tears flew from my eyes during all sacrifices......... the survival was epic... But it had too much of blood scene...,10
"First moment, it started well but by going end of it, it becomes miserable Korean emotional drama.I couldn't understand characters, I couldn't understand their decisions. Over actings against their families and friends made feeling so stressed.Too much dramas for zombie action. The original webtoon was kind of this, but they shouldn't apply this kind of unnecessary things.And why they chose those bad actors?",7
"I read the negative reviews and it was all like ""Zombie is the same"",""Its just another zombie movie"",""Too long and boring""First of all its a series and this is better than walking dead ""for me""
Walking Dead is great tbh im not saying its trash or bad.Second of all its zombies what do you expect at least they added a new aspect of half zombies that has only been used 2-5 times in movies or series.The scene where Namra jumped off school was so cool
And when Lee cheongsan sacrificed his life in the building.Lastly,They are mostly new actors but look at the outstounding work they've showed in the series.",10
"George Romero, the movie god who invented the modern zombie, always cast ordinary people as the characters in his films. He wanted zombies to represent us in a world of problems so relentless, so savage and so violent that they threaten to literally eat us alive. He wanted a world without death, with no end to our suffering, where we become the monsters when we die. He wanted the brutality to be banal, familiar and up close, where a world isn't saved by handsome Brad Pitt in three hours of pointless CGI.Everyone has problems, and that is why every country has zombie movies. In Romero's US, the zombies represent a population so self absorbed that they have lost track of what is important to them. Both the surviving humans and the zombies themselves seek refuge in a shopping center because consumerism has replaced idealism in this country, In Venezuela, the zombies represent the rapid disintegration after the madman who ruled the country dies. The Venezuelans who try to escape are killed by their own friends and neighbors. In Africa, the zombies are what happens when nature takes the land back from the humans who are trying to change it. In the UK, zombies make England's island isolation into a prison where escape seems impossible.You all know the movies. If you are reading this review, you like zombies.In Korea, zombies are about young people. Train to Busan is the story of a young girl who survives, but to what end? #Alive is about a young gamer. The Wailing is about the disintegration of a village.Korea is rapidly changing. It becomes more Westernized and industrial every day. The generation that lives through the Korean War is dying, and the ancient culture that sustained the country for centuries is being replaced by a First World country with cutting edge technology. However, Korea still sits between China and Japan, and the threat of annihilation from the crazy man in North Korea is ever present.To that end, this series is both the same old zombie by virus plot, but embedded in the daily horror of high school everyone faces. The bullies are nearly as awful as the zombies, the principal is an idiot, the teachers are a mix of caring and stupid, and the pressure to succeed is painful.Zombies invade a high school through the idiocy of a teacher. There are massive casualties as the kids fight for their lives, Only when it is obvious to everyone that all hope is lost does a teacher admit what has happened and tell the kids to leave. Then it is still every person trying to save himself. The virus that causes the zombie infection is stronger than human connection.Young Koreans face a world in which, no matter how hard they work or how much they care, they are not safe from monsters. Teachers don't care if they are bullied. Friends turn against them. And, everyday, they face oblivion.But they are teenagers, and they try.Romero would like this series.",6
"Despite some flaws, this show is a pretty good zombie series and I was rather surprised at how binge-able this was.It did a very decent job of presenting gore, mystery, thrill, drama and--of course--romance. The overall effect of the plot is captivating that you find yourself drawn in. The makeup on the zombies is extremely disgusting, which superbly serves its purpose. The mystery and thrill of the story does a good job to keep you glued to the screen, wanting to know what happens next. Although a lot of characters remain flat, I'm glad they aren't all so one-sided.My biggest gripes of this series are 1) how quickly they get rid of characters without giving them a chance to really make an impact or finish their stories 2) the frustrating decisions some characters make leading to dumb consequences (seems like a theme for a lot of horror/thriller movies, which could be fixed). 3) The color of blood on the costumes at times feel a bit too pink, but that's coming from someone who works in film. 4) The CGI feels very unrealistic at times, which takes you out of the film. If these elements were done better, I think I would have enjoyed this a lot more.If you're into zombie shows, this deserves a shot. It has a lot of gore, endless action sequences, mixed with different character relationships and thrilling nailbiting moments.",8
Two third of the first episode is just unnecesarry scene about the characters love life and some bully side story but it has absolute no impact later. After 3 episodes of just running around the school i gave up..,3
"Having enjoyed Squid Game, thought I would give this a go, the first scene was very violent but captivating all the same, as the storyline became clearer it became addictive viewing. Only watched 3 episodes but really enjoying this South Korean horror fest. Enjoy.",9
"Going into this, I had admittedly high expectations because the trailer looked so good. Those expectations didn't hold up past the first episode, except for the phenomenal acting. All the characters pulled their weight and felt genuine the entire time. However, that is the only great thing about this show.The plot is infuriatingly slow paced with no character development and even less chemistry between the main cast. There are no stand out cinematic scenes, no fun fight scenes, and as the stakes stay the same the entire time, everything starts to blur together.The creators obviously tried to make statements about human nature, bullying, teenage conflict, teenage pregnancy, etc but all of those plot lines were messy and fell apart with no emotional hit on the viewer.I really wish I liked this show. It had potential, but as me and my friend watched it, the #1 overwhelming emotion we experienced was annoyance. If this show was a color it would be gray-- no seriously it's like they had a gray filter over the camera constantly.I don't recommend wasting your time on this. Even for a background noise show, you can find something actually entertaining and bad in a fun way, unlike this. The end makes no sense and isn't fulfilling either.Thank you for reading :)",5
7.5 is my correct rating. If you are a fan of zombie series this is definitely your cup of time. This series have heavy brutality and violence and everything looks real. The making camera moment all were fantastic.The main defects were the length. 8 episode were have been perfect but they dragged a lot at the end. The other defects were about the zombies. The zombie should be like the usual like in train to bushan but they changed it . Some of the enfected people don't become zombie and thay get super powers . Feels like they copied sweet home.Anyway it is a fun series for zombie fans. The others may not have liked it and don't expect anything like kingdom.,7
"I loved the way the series handles school students facing everything from nasty bullying, true friendship, love to questions about life itself. What if you and your friend are hiding from the zombies, quietly in the restroom, and your friend begins to turn into a zombie, would you kill her? Would you let her eat you, because she cannot help herself?I hope season 2 is made as well!!",10
"The first couple of episodes was a bust, i was on the verge of quitting it but I decided to continue and I am glad I did. The reason as a lot of people said before me was the emotions in the first couple of episodes lacked, however further on their emotions do come out. Had some funny parts as well as sad parts. I enjoyed it so watch all the episodes before you rate it because it does get better.",7
"Intense and doesn't let up. I had to stop a few times to take a few breaths.The perfect zombie flick, except it is 12 episode long. Koreans do indeed do zombies justice.Ignore those naysayers, just watch it. At least you'll get the ride of your life.",10
"If u are expecting it to be like kingdom or train to busan. Then this is not it. Storyline' s a bit mundane, some actings are -meh-. Reviewers here are smitten by the cute Koreans actors period and nothing more. So expect bias reviews and ""don't listen to hater"" quotes used. SIMPS reviews are not actual reviews so do yourself a favour don't waste bingeing this series like I did. You are better off re watching the other awesome zombie series/movies.",1
"I love zombie movies and series! And I was so excited to watch all of us are dead, but unfortunately I ended up very disappointed. The very first thing that happened is they mocked Christianity, and as a Christian it doesn't feel very nice, but I decided to give it another chance. I continue and it gets pretty exciting. But I started to get frustrated, the characters keep making stupid decisions, they are so slow to action, and continues to fall ALL THE TIME, even when there is no reason to fall. It's okey one or two times but after a couple of times it just gets tiring. If you love zombie movies like me, you should watch it just for the sake of watching it, I meaning they did a good job and the zombies are fast and threatening, but don't expect the best show of all time.",6
The first episode was difficult to watch due to bullying and sexual assault. To begin with the story draws you in and you want the characters to be able survive the zombies apocalypse.As the story continued the characters stories are all intertwined from a horrific event. The overall question became will theses characters be able to survive each other and zombies.,10
"Good. It is a Korean zombie film that subtly reveals the current reality of COVID-19 in Korea. The situation in Korea is shown well throughout the scene, so if you want to know about Korea, I recommend you watch this movie.",10
This is my fist review!If you are like me and misses the good old chaos of the walking dead this hits the spot! Currently on episode 4 and this buildup is exeptional. Bit slow the first two episodes but worth the wait. The actors make it fun to watch in the original language imo.,9
"If you're a fan of the Zombie genre then you should enjoy this. Good mix of character development, gore and thrills.If you're looking for something to watch and a fan of the genre then this will be right up your alley.",7
Where do i start... this is about teenagers and puppy love kinda story. The plot is lame and the script is the worst. This is a Zombie series for preteens or younger. Not good... stay away.My 2 stars arr for good zombie effects and cgi.,2
"This show has been pretty good thus far as I feel they have stepped it up a notch from the last Korean Zombie series called ""Kingdom"".The special effects look more realistic of the blood spewin from the zombies necks compared to previous korean zombie series and movies also.I dont like watching anything Korean but I do love their zombie stuff cause its always got superb acting. Out of all Asian zombie movies/shows i would say Koreans ranks the top as I have seen some very terrible ones from I believe Thai Or filipino and also Indian zombie series that were trash.Western Zombie stuff is different then the Korean ones from the way they look too how they transform into zombies.What western shows like The Walking Dead lacked was that it became to easy too kill zombies that their was no immediate danger. As well as the zombies all walk slow vs in the korean series they run and move fast and every encounter becomes a very close escape.I seen some bad reviews on here but i feel these people are not giving it a fair judgement. Some complained about how its repetitive like other zombie shows but when u rate a show/movie u should be rating it for itself and not comparing it to other movies/shows.Thats where Bias mindsets always kick in cause they always keep having expectations set already of comparing it to previous zombie shows or even worse is when people compare how an actor acts in other movies vs current ones.So give this show a chance and dont rate it against other shows, thats not giving it a fair chance at all.Just rate it as it is and how it is presented and you will find you will enjoy tv series n movies more then always having a closed mindset with full on expectations of how it shouldnt be or should be directed n written n acted.",9
"The series hooks a lot, in realism with which everything happens from the emotional reactions,
government strategies and reaction is very well written.It is one of the few zombie series or movies that I have seen where the protagonists do not start doing illogical nonsense.On the other hand, the level of acting is very good and the staging of some scenes is at another level.",8
"Once you get past the second episode it is absolutely amazing!! Episode one and two are too unrealistic. I understand it is just a tv show (it's not real life) but the characters emotions and actions are unrealistic to the point where you don't want to watch it. However, after episode one and two the show becomes absolutely amazing, addictive and enjoyable to watch. Although there are problems with the first 2 episodes I highly recommend everyone to watch this show. And I cannot wait for season 2!!!",10
"Violent sexual assault. Extreme bullying.But perhaps worse was a (presumably) real person's review stating that women should be ""rightfully so"" broken in half.",2
"Some reviews ""big this up"" and others don't, I'm in the don't camp. Watched E 1&2 then jumped to E 12 to see the ending (nothing special).Seems Korean students ages range from mid-twenties to late thirties. The one upside is not watching the woke inclusive snooze-fest that would be forced upon oneself if filmed in a western country.",2
I finish this series in one day ?? to be honest it's very catchy and thise who dislike this zkdrama after watching 1-2 episodes imma advice you guys to take your time and give it another shot because it will be worth! Good and interesting things happen on the middle of the show not at first! You have to be patient. I can't wait for season 2 already if there is gonna be one but i hope yes! I'm obsessed!!! 10 stars from me.,10
"I have just done binge-watching the whole drama within a night and have enjoyed it! Well, the plot has some weak points that will be easy to finger-pointing while watching. However, it makes more sense than other monstrous apocalyptic k-dramas on Netflix that I have seen (e.g. Better than Sweet Home in many aspects I'd say).It has pointed out the problem with our justice system and humanity. Also, that, at dangerous moments, it's love and hope that binds us together.Jumping to the ending scene, it's nice that it has ended with giving hope that not everyone that we saw dead is actually dead. I bet that if there's a second season, it'll show Cheong-san surviving the bombing (by becoming a mutated zombie like Gwi-Nam with self-regenerating power).",7
"A really enjoyable thriller of a zombie outbreak in korea, most of the characters are really well written, a few plot holes, but other than that this show was worth binge watching.",9
"Pilot was very weak I must say But show picks up pace in completely contrasting fashion from second episode and depicts almost everything a lover for zombie shows wants.But it's NOT for you if you can't stand Gore at all.Well obviously you can't compare it to 'The Walking Dead' but they have done a very good job.So if you love zombie shows, give it a shot one episode beyond the pilot.",8
"The very less important part of this series is the forced division of roles, such as the role of parents of the main female and male characters because it ends in vain, and the role of the police which is considered to give hope, just happens, and along with the death of members per group, which seems forced, even though there is no need why in all episodes must be sacrificed.",6
"This show is very good
Teen age drama in me made this even better
An Emotional Touch Development From Esme Joe Characters Is Also Good
And yah show is nothing less than a masterpiece to me
So go and hurry to the show
look at.",10
"Wow is it really stressful to watch #AllOfUsAreDead ? I really want to tune in but seeing all of the reaction makes me think twice lol. What else is there to say about this series once for sure, even those who like zombies must see it.",10
"First of all, when zombie attacks started, I thought same thing like other comments ;'welcome to train to Busan', till now it ok for me I am on second episode. A little slow and too long but still ok. Some scenes are really good as a cinematography, Korean people knows how to make tension.I will not say this is a disturbing zombie series.",8
You know korea has made many amazing zombies movies and they never disappoint us. This movie is also one of the best zombies. You should definitely try this.,8
I was expecting a good zombie series. The setting is not bad.Most of the characters are useless.There's nothing interesting. Boring. Bad script.Some of the kids are not good at acting.,2
I can give up on my soul to watch this drama for the first time once again. This is one of the best show i have watched so far. And I really am waiting for a season 2. :((,10
"This show is so different from every other zombies movie or series, It's very interesting how the virus works which we find out later, the virus was supposed to help the weak, it's not just that but I won't say too much but it's so interesting and it's not some stupid action movie, and it breaks a lot of stereotypes of tv series, and the best thing is the characters know how zombies work, it's so meta. It's rlly good.",10
"First, its boring. How come a zombie movie boring? Thats surprised me as well.The writing is so bad. Is the story writer newbie?The story went slowly, they try to put emotional scenes, but the scenes were not touching at all. Theres a lot of crying but im not even feel sad. And im actually easily moved.I try so hard not to skip and fast forwards those episodes.What with the teen love story? They have no chemistry, so intead of moved by their hearts, its just like some baseless stupid move.The students were not so bright, 6 episodes and none of them try to hold something for a weapon with them all the time, not even broom or a stick. I get it if they are stupid, but having a survival instinct would be rational.Im questioning all of their decisions. Lol. These kids have no hope.And finally, none of the cast that makes you feel like ""i hope they survive"", if at the end all of them is dead, its not even surprising, and even satisfying. Seeing how thise kids act in the middle of crisis.The only good stuff is the bloody scenes, those are executed well. But still, you need to skip like half of the time to see bloody scenes.",3
"I avoid trailers nowadays, I check the description, who is in it and who made it and that seems to work for me. I really enjoyed this series, binged with my wife. If ur looking for a good zombie horror action with some kdrama and kquirks this is really good, just note the 1st episode sets up the show so it's abit slow.",8
"If you are bored and nothing to watch I'll recommend this. But whenever that high school girl acting like damsel in distress i fast forward. Like come on, if you're faced on this situation adrenaline must kick in and stop being like you need someone to save you. Her character is annoying.",6
"This was a great 12 episode TV show for me.If you like Train to Busan and Kingdom, this is a great show for you.This show is a treat as it has tons of gore.There are some plot holes or things that didn't make sense but overall this is another Korean show that will go in my top 10 of awesome zombie shows/movies.Cannot wait for season 2.",9
"Don't waste your time with this. It's boring and stupid. You'll be frustrated by the characters actions and dialog.For example:
Spoilers: if you're alone in a science lab and you hear a rattling sound, the sensible thing would be to RUN or WALK AWAY. And not snoop in. Most definitely NOT insert your finger in a caged hamster! Seriously! How dumb was that???",1
"I want to take my medicine when someone prays.Please pray for me first to the end of the day.Please forgive me
I have nowhere to look.I want it I want it.",10
"The main characters were not smart. They knew it was zombies, yet did not bother to smash the brains. Also, so many stupid decisions made by the characters - only to make everything more dramatic.",1
"Great kdrama, it was nerve-wrecking, horryfying. Love the fact that no character presented as perfect and the storyline reflects many societal problems that we know but usually ignore.Overall, I recommend to watch!",10
"This show brings absolutely nothing new to the zombie genre and falls for all the same pitfalls zombie movies from 2002 fell for.Zombies in drama teenage school with a little bit of bullying undertone but nothing ever feels like a _complete story_.It's just a string of events and 1 dimensional comic book-like characters who serve exactly one purpose: the sad girl, the maniac bully, the fat kids who loves chicken. It's almost satire.Entertaining background noise but I can't help to think - was this conjured by an AI?",4
"This is way far better than all The Walking Dead seasons combined. Highly recommended for both who likes the zombie genre and those who doesn't like it.This isn't your usual, ordinary, zombie show. It's full of character development, real life and realistic drama, and lessons in survival and life itself.",10
"I know these people were just thrown into a zombie apocalypse but there are just decisions some of these characters make that just require common sense.Example: if you see the privileged loner girl wiping blood off a mop handle, SAY SOMETHING before she uses it to infect one of her own.Also who cares about honorifics and courtesy during an attack on your schoolAnd then there is Cheong-su's mom, who braves Hyosan to try to get to her child and get through many infected except she doesn't realize one of his friends is infected and stupidly calls out to him.",5
Excellent series with lots of emotions mixed by koreansKoreans really know how to make a zombie flick!Great character building and introduction of the different plotlines.Two episodes in and it's mayhen and chaos all over the school!As you go on more characters and different situations are presented and it all unfolds perfectly.It is really well paced and non-stop action. A dramatic scene here and there but not too much to get you bored.Freaky zombie outbreak like I've never seen before (only in Train to Busan).I can't wait to see how it all plays out.,10
It is a good web series and its story is also very nice. The way it is directed is also very good and I want to watch its season 2 And i am requesting watch this series once you will also be a fan of it.,10
"In general, I would say this is a very good show. I admit there are some flaws in some plots. You can still call this zombie show a good one. It covers a lot of topics. High school campus life, school bullying, society problems, politics, friendship, love, humanity. All of this elements in one show, compared with some other zombie show, this one is extraordinary.",9
"From starting to end, not a single second seemed boring, neither the ending is predictable nor the characters you will think definitely survive will survive. It's gory, it's emotional, it's amazing. Just don't believe in bad reviews, they must have bad taste. From the first episode you'll see how amazing this series is and you'll end up binged watching it. If you like Train To Busan, you're going to love All Of Us Are Dead.",10
Was this supposed to be the Korean version of Stranger Things? I love Asian cinema but this is so childish And badly acted that I quit after one episode. Move along. Nothing to see here.,1
"Those korean kids acts like they have some kind of retardation themselves. It is too far from reality. I know, zombies are far as well, however it is about them before turning into zombies. My god, they do absurd things, when they are trying too much scaping from zombies is ridiculous, they go out the building go back inside, no one even tries to scape from there.The drama itself do not convincing anyone. What I observed: they are smarter when they get infected, what is hilarious, I do not know how young Koreans are actualy, but if they are like that then South Korea has dark times upcoming. The scenes, their decisions, everything is a lame in this terrible series. I think if there is some screenwriter that is an idiot, ok. But there are: producers, directors and actors themselves. How, in this world that could be convincible? HOW in this world? I fear that from few years ago to the future, the cinema is not an art anymore it is just a bunch of crazy inflated egos trying to do over and over the samep s..t.",3
I watched all episodes. Overall it was a good watch. Sometimes it becomes boring too see some long conversations. They seem to be usesless. Yes i understand there is a philosophy about this show but they don't need to smash it all the time.,6
This is actually a masterpiece.. Korea knows how to dissolve someone's heart .. they provide best zombie cinematic with lots of emotions and all characters are frictional..,10
"Each and every episode just hooked n booked but only the last episode of the series little bit slow n length of episode felt ,but at the conclusion I just wanna say it's completely horror + thriller combo which is made must watch drama.",10
"Ive readed this manhwa and it was quite enjoyable. But ive noticed theres so much other things on this serie. Some of them are quite enjoyable, but at the other some arent. Pretty disappointed.",5
"This series is like a heaven for zombie lovers. 12 hours of constant fast paced zombies. Story is good, acting is good. The way they created the scene and casted actors, everything is amazing. I watch even stupid zombie movies, but this one was done really really well. Go for it. After Kingdom, train to busan this is one of best next gem from Korean cinemas. Congrats to all the team !!",10
"One of the best zombie series out there. Don't believe ,check it out. Let me tell you Zombie isn't my thing. I'm shocked how I fell in love with the series.(I suck at reviews , hope you get wht I mean to say)The characters are so well written and so well played, one can clearly see the human behaviour and how they change according to situation.The friendship ,the way the characters stepped up sacrificing themselves for others , so selfless , so bold and so touching. Every character has it's deapth ever sacrifice had it's meaning , totally touched by this series , I wish you wld too.( P.s - I'm in love with the character Lee CheongSan , man hez the real hero )",9
"Irritating Characters, Slow moving storyline and Horrible Screenplay are few of the many flaws..Had the potential for a good movie but it was stretched to become a 12 Hrs of struggle.",1
"Is this a great zombie outbreak show? Yes. Is it plauged by the occasional cheesy comic relief cliches at points? Also Yes. But this show goes so much further than that. In the end it's less about the zombies and more about the horrific trauma the outbreak inflicts on everyone involved. It shows the perspective of survivors as well as rescuers and military. No one is spared from the effects of this nightmare and nothing is black and white. It's honestly tough to watch at times and nauseating to see what these people have to go through, but it's refreshing in the sense that it isn't just a mindless hack and slash zombie flick and actually deals with tragedy as well as moral and ethical dilemmas. Highly Recommend.",9
"I liked Train to Busan so when they said that a new Korean zombie show was coming out I was really excited. The trailer looked good and I'm for TV series over movies to tell a big story all day any day. I thought it was cool that they had some scientific explanations for the zombie outbreak and not just ""it started"". It was also cool to have 12 hours to cover surviving a zombie apocalypse rather than 2 in a movie. But the show really fell flat.For starters, the plot was really ridiculous at times. The virus origin story was just ""what""? So the teacher's son was bullied, and instead of protecting him, moving him to another school, finding ways to prove the bullies' guilt, using his status as a teacher to push for punishment, signing him up for self defense classes and basically everything rational... he injects his son with a new virus he just created? I'm impressed he was able to contain his son and wife at home without getting hurt himself btw. Then when the virus broke out his actions were really inconsistent. He was agitated at first when finding out that the student he chained up was released. But then he took centuries to explain everything. Also he sent the cop to his computer to retrieve the solution when it was just ""burn them all""? I was really hoping this character would be developed and utilized more, since the scientific side of a zombie virus is pretty interesting and would've separated this series from other zombie shows.Moving on, the characters that we follow are mostly not very likable. There were some actors that were horendous at acting too. Zombie in your face and these kids just poker face... I get that these kids are just teenagers, but it's a zombie apocalypse, one of the kids actually mentioned Train to Busan in episode 1 or sth, lets get to work with building up defenses, armoring up, finding resources, figuring out what's going on outside... can we save the meaningless squabbles and love triangle drama for later? The kids also act very dumb at times. Can we throw an infected person out of the room before they actually become a zombie and get another person bitten? Yes I can imagine it being tough when it's a friend or family, but sometimes they really go over the top with it and just makes the characters seem stupid and irrational. Neither the protagonists nor the antagonists were particularly well written, and I can't help feeling that the writer had something against women in general. I get that Asia's gender expectations are more traditional, but most of the females just cowered behind while the guys did all the work. Like seriously? You need the guys to tell you to help them push and not just sit behind and watch?Half way through the series become more about the conscious ""half zombies"" than the rabid thrashing ones, which is okay, but the subplots were quite underwhelming too. The bully's obsessed with the male lead. The bullied girl decides that the person she wants to avenge the most is... the guy that tried to comfort her at the rooftop? Class president gained these super powers and couldn't die anymore... and she couldn't do anything to help? Like go out, find a safe path, find food & water? It's like having Spiderman with an invisibility buff on your team and he does almost nothing. They spent half an episode on making toilets, a much more mundane matter that nobody asked for.I wanted to like the series. I really did. I watched it as soon as it came out, but in the end it was kind of underwhelming. It wasn't terrible, it was a thrill to watch people run away from the zombies, but many of the times when they weren't actively fighting or escaping the zombies ended up pretty frustrating.",7
"I don't understand all the bad ratings, I really liked it. Some characters not so much, but in general I really liked it. It was entertaining and comical.",10
"It's definitely one of the better zombie flicks. The acting is great, the story is good. I would have given it a 7 or 8 if it weren't for two very annoying things, that I couldn't get past:1. They had literally nothing to eat or drink for what seemed more than two days, while half the time running, fighting zombies, climbing up and down buildings, and parkouring. Non of them seemed pretty fazed about that and apart from a few comments, the lack of vital sustenance in a zombie apocalypse, was considered pretty much like an insignificant detail, rather than the difference between life and death.2. Decision making and reactions were at points absurdity itself. Someone is bitten, turning, and will kill us all - let's stare and see what will happen - that, on more than one occasion. Zombies are attacking my friends - let me stare for a while and then hit them with a book. We have to make other split second decisions - again let's stare. There's a lot of staring going on.Overall, however it's a good movie if you get past this and some other annoying details.",6
One of the best Zombie series I have seen.. I don't know why some give negative reviews.. Seriously what you guyzz expect in zombie series???emotional scenes are good.. Zombie scenes nice... I could rate 10/10.,10
"If you want to have a good laugh with friends, you've come to the right place. I've reached the conclusion that this series was actually produced, funded, filmed,
directed and acted by the high school teenagers themselves. What a scream...",1
As with all Korean shows there are things that have to be ignored if you're not Korean yourself like the main characters arguing over how a junior student in the school spoke to a senior one when there are Zombies trying to break down doors and kill everyone.Moving on from that the show has very good production value and special effects are on par with anything else out there.The characters are engaging and make you feel everything from happiness to sadness and everything in between. The show keeps you invested and you can never be sure who the next person to be killed will be. The cast is very good and fully engaged in what they do every min they are on the screen which in turn keeps you engaged as well.The only criticism is that some episodes are somewhat samey and in effect become fillers. They show could be a minimum of 2 if not more episodes shorter and still have the same impact.Final verdict is that while it's not by any means ambitious or life changing but in my humble opinion well worth watching.I binged it over one weekend and quite a happy camper.,8
"There is no story line, the crew want to keep themselves safe.. the main female character acts so baaaddddddd... But for production need applause worthy... VFX and CGI are really good.",5
Shame cause first episode was amazing zombies runing around people runing away really good action.But then second episode kids drama and plot armor to main kids.They start kicking zombies ash and.one kid is Jett Lee.3 episode is the same way i just got tierd of it.Shame cause first episode was amazing!,1
"Ok, it's not the 'Train to Busan stopping first at high school' that I had hoped it would be but I quite enjoyed it. It might benefit from there being a bit of a lull in good stuff being released right now though(?).It basically follows the progress of a couple of groups of kids (most focus being on the the one, larger group) as they try to escape the zombie infested high school.Along the way, stuff happens - some more interesting than others, some of it is really quite stupid and there are times when I felt like switching off but am glad I didn't. The first episode or two in particular are a bit... iffy...Watch it expecting a Young Adult horror series and you'll enjoy it more than if you go into it expecting it to be outright horror.",7
"Solid zombie high school K-drama. Beautiful and memorable precious things about High schools and friends are shown inside this show. Suspenseful, heartbreaking and very interesting! Legit acting. This tv series deserves recognition. Overall, very promising and recommend to watch.",9
"I rate this show a 10/10 because it deserve a better ranking , and its the only zombie show that i like the most.I felt really connected to the characters .I had high hopes for this show and eventually im not disapointed.",10
"So, original ideas have apparently vanished. This show is pretty much a live action Korean version of the anime: high school of the dead. It's just, Meh! Has none of the originality and entertainment value of the original. Very disappointed.",3
"I'm giving this a rating because I've only lasted two episodes. The action scenes are very well done -- high school kids make wonderfully enthusiastic, energetic extras, whether they're twisting and twitching as man-eating zombies or frantically fleeing the same man-eating zombies.But the scenes without zombie action are ridiculously amateurish: stiff, slow, and lethargic. I began to lose patience when a bunch of high school students, having narrowly escaped the zombies that have overrun their school, feebly barricade themselves inside a classroom and stand around calmly musing how best to phone the police.The scene drags on like a slow dinner party. Two girls stare out the window and literally chat about their teenage relationships (one of them grinning impishly), while just a few feet away, separated by thin panes of glass, a mob of red-eyed students-turned-zombies wave and growl and hungrily gnash their teeth.Zombie movies are by definition silly. Still, if they're to work, the human characters in them should behave with at least some semblance of reality.",8
"All of Us Are Dead: Zombie outbreak at a high school in Hyosan. South Korea. Most of characters are meant to be 16-17 but this is really an adult drama, when the students turn Zombie they bite out throats, take chunks out of people. Victims and Zombies alike jump and fall out of windows, frantic boys and girls barricade themselves in classrooms, battle against the Zombies. Fast moving action just like the Zombies who sprint about. Subplots about bullying and teen romance help the narrative along while the school principal wants to pretend everything is ok. A horror series which shocks but the terror is leavened by the teen love stories. The outbreak spreads. Zombie hordes charging at lines of riot police, even 3 deep they struggle to hold them back. Zombies munching on intestines. The dranas between the still human students becoming more intense. Refugees fleeing Hyosan are ""othered"", feared, even attacked. As so ften happens the authorities abandon the inhabitants of Hyosan while pretending to help them. It's an old trope but is given new life (or death) here due to the editing, acting and direction. How the Zombie virus was created is gradually revealed, it's root cause tied in with events which transpired at the school, you'll have to watch the series to put everything together, no spoilers here! Really convincing acting and effects. Directed by Lee Jae-kyoo and Kim Nam-su. Written by Chun Sung-il. 12 episodes on Netflix. 9/10.",9
"Should've been 8 episodes or 10 maximum. A lot of High School drama should've been on the Editing floor.Good performances by everyone.Scene of Cheongsan and his Zombie mom stood out for me. It was very Heartbreaking.A reasonably well made coming of age teenage zombie action drama. No horror though, did not feel any scare during the whole show. It was Action.",7
"Think Freakish and Walking Dead: World Beyond with the frequent intensity of Train to Busan, but so much better than the first two. Even with some of the cliched relationships and instances, this still felt much more creatively original than the garbage that's come out of the US for the past decade.",8
"""Don't listen to the haters"" lol. There is a reason this show has mixed reviews. The story is lacking, common sense doesn't exist, characters are inconsistent with their actions, zombie infection makes no sense, people zombifies based on length of their last farewell speech. It feels like the script was written to purposely annoy viewers.If you're bored and have absolutely nothing to do or watch, go for it. Otherwise, you can skip this one. Go watch Squid Games. Much better than this.",1
"I am one of those who read webtoon before, the original webtoon is perfect! The female protagonist isn't annoying and is addictive to male like series. For some reason this turned out to be super power zombie fighting and the most unforgivable part is the fight between normal human vs mutation one. (the mutation is lost by the way lol). The dad of onjo tried to save his daughter bravely but died so wastefully. I strongly recommend reading webtoon. It is much much better. I give this 5/10 somehow I can relate this to the original one.",5
"The show is mid and all imma say is, it's the characters fault. It could have been good but 80% of the characters are written so dumb. Almost all of them are the female characters.At one point they're trying to make a fire to warm themselves and they keep struggling for like 10 minutes and all of a sudden this one girl goes I have a lighter and I'm like b**** why u didn't say that earlier. And there is that other girl who used to get bullied a lot, she got infected but isn't a zombie, all she got are superpowers and she uses them to kill someone who comforted her a lot of times in the past infront of the military and other people. And then she gets shocked when the military dudes take her away and lock her up like bruh what u expect when u bite someone to death??? Stupid b****.",5
This series is one of the best zombie survival. It resembles train to busan. But it eas great to show the series interesting throughout 12 hours. Not boring at any place. Many seat cornering scenes are there . One of the best thriller k drama after squid game. Worth for 12 hours.,8
"So I decided to give the live action a go because I saw it's No 4 in Ireland on Netflix right now and I found out that it is based off a Webtoon. Yeah it's not a great art so definitely this was the better version personally! I may not be a fan of zombie themed stuff because they are always obvious and you know wtf was going to happen. I mean, this series isn't any different from every zombie flick out there but at least it puts some twists and turns to make you interested. I honestly was interested with how the character Na-ra was able to look less zombish and able to jump from the roof like a ninja?! Yeah I am assuming that cliffhanger would be left to s2 or just giving us poor audience a tease to make out what really happened in our heads. Even if the ending was pretty much a very questionable one, the characters, the music and the storyline in a way were entertaining enough. Yes it is clique in some parts with,using recycled horror tropes but again, I really enjoyed it and glad I didn't bother with the Webtoon...",7
"I'm looking forward to it.And zombies are the best
I wanna see next season drm
This is very nice see and fun.I want to recommend it this drama.Hahahahahaha.",10
"Don't give up after 2-3 episodes.I'm not a huge fan of the genre, and I skimmed through a lot of chase scenes because they get to be a bit repetitive.However, I found myself enjoying this show more and more. While there are familiar tropes from past zombie show playbooks, there are plenty of new things in the show that have kept me engaged throughout.",8
"It's a good show. Sometimes too long. Could have been shorter at about 8 episodes. I found myself just forwarding lot of moments and during that nothing happened. Just people watching into each other eyes. And that's a lot of minutes. Sometimes, i questioned a lot of decisions. But reminded myself these are just a bunch of kids who are supposed to be 15-17 years old. In addition, this is happening in an Asian society so a lot of decision makings are just different from kids who are in a western country.The Character developments are okay. We see different types so it'll be easy for people to recognize themselves in the kids.Some comedic moments are added to the show to lighten it. Some scenes are just gore.The ending leaves space for a part 2.Overall it's a good show to watch. Not perfect. But good.",7
"To be honest, the first few episodes were quite entertaining. But the dumb and annoying characters really killed the show for me. One stupid and unnecessary decision after another.The girls act mostly like some annoying, spoiled, and rude wannabe Rambos. And most boys, on the other hand, are some weak cowards without a spine or any integrity. The characters (except for a few) were so annoying to the extend that I was desperately hoping they would get killed.Trash writing and mostly trash characters. What a disappointment.",3
"Some very cringey moments, idiotic decisions made by characters and it drags too but once you get used to it you can get hooked.Not the best Zombie show out there but it's quite entertaining. Hope they make Season 2.",7
The best zombie movie i have seen. Before this my best zombie movie was world wat z. If u have time i recomand u to watch this all at once. I t will bring u horror and sadness.,10
"Some scenes do not make sense, like the open wound on a hand being able to infect people being wiped with contaminated cloth yet when the infected blood goes into the mouth or eyes while hanging over the fighting survivors and nothing happens makes no sense. When the survivors were fighting the infected during the barricade scenes, their fingers were exposed and would have easily been bitten off. The scene with the bully not using the girl with the pink shirt as bait while coming out of the supply closet made no sense to lure the survivors and open the roof door instead of climbing the pipe like spider-man. Military fighting scenes should have used silencers on the weapons and night vision. Helicopter should not have had loud engine sound or bright spot lights because it could have used heat signature optics.The survivors should have had more improvised weapons that were deadly, like the drone scene being modified with a gun or explosive as it would have made more sense. For example, the girl survivors had long hair that could have easily been grabbed by infected. During the barricade scenes, the infected would have grabbed their long hair and dragged toward the barricade and bit their necks. The scene with the sound wave drones makes no sense that it did not affect the hambies or half human/infected mutants. The 119 father character only grabbing one gun from the police station made no sense after visiting the armory and would have gotten far more weapons.Too many plot holes occurred such as what happened to the orange vlogger, detective/other cop, and survivors at the concentration camp. The bully kid would have survived falling the fourth time since the height of the school was taller than the construction site. Plus, the bully survived getting PIERCED from the construction site height. It does not make sense the bully would be dead after falling from the construction site (about five stories) compared to the roof of the school building.",8
"...watching someone turn into a zombie before they take action? You take action before they get off the floor and try to bite you. It can be forgiven the first time (maybe even the second time), but every time? And it seems all the kids know zombie lore (one of them even mentions Train to Busan), yet don't act accordingly to defend themselves?I've been watching a lot of Korean shows, and there's a trend where people don't do the right thing so they don't embarrass themselves or the job. And everyone always seems to be up for a job review, and it's better to let people die rather than speak up to avoid a negative review. Is it a narrative staple in Korea, or is that actually the culture (like the incessant crying in Korean tv and movies)?I'll still watch the shows because they're still a hell of a lot better than the American crap.",5
"At first, it seemed boring, but it became more fun toward the second half. I watched it all in three days. It can be said to be the best zombie series. I hope season 2 comes out soon.",10
I think the whole story was underwhelming and mediocre and some of the characters plot armour is just so crazy that sometimes it annoys you. The only redeeming quality for this series is the cinematography and some of the side characters.,3
"I binged watch this and finished the whole series in one day because I got addicted. This movie astonished me and I really like it. Tho I wish there are somethig the writers did add such as when Naeyon apologize to them, the girl , who was filmed while nude, got revenge to Gwinam, the bully, and many more. I don't understand why some people don't like this series 'cause for me it's a masterpiece. I'm really hoping for season 2, for Cheongsang to be still alive and his endgame with On Jo , I wanna see them as couple they are cute. Yes, good actor and almost good writing for me.",10
"Honestly speaking , I thought this would be just a random zombie series that others usually do . But this one hits different . There are a few lags in between , yes but none of them matter coz that's what adds up to show . The start maybe a bit slow where the students hide in different rooms but after the 4th episode, I binged till the end. That's how the show keeps you hooked up . Kudos to everyone involved and thankyou for such an amazing experience.",10
"Please watch 1ep for 1day.if one at a time it feels boring
Some Repeat fights, but story is a some little bit unique.Camera work is best, You need Spoiler ??????,",4
"Honestly, the trailer looked awesome but the show itself is absolutely disappointing! It's so slow, so much talking and too many plotlines that are not needed.The gore was okay but could've been better. So many characters did not make sense, within a matter of minutes the virus has made half human and half zombie without there being a follow up on that.Characters that should've had a big impact on the story end up being pointless. There is more time spent talking and sitting around a fire than there is zombies. They spend so much of the time running from room to room which could easily been avoided if they just secured the room.The fact that too many characters are annoying and just do nothing for the story.This show is bad. Really bad. I do not recommend.",3
"Did not meet my expectation, I was excited for this show when I saw the trailer.But after watching thru episode 5 I gave up.The sound of bones creeking and how the body moves when they are turning into zombie is lame.Its like sadako ish.The story is boring, too much dialogue and drama.Students are not going hungry.I know some people will enjoy this but not me maybe because walking dead set the standards high.The only korean zombie series that is good is the Kingdom.",2
"Idk how people are rating this series with 8 or even 6 and above. Absolutely horrible acting by the cast and honestly the worst storyline...Makes me even more appreciative of ""The Kingdom"" series and the movie ""Train to Busan"", which were so well made with great acting/casting.Gae-no-jam.",1
"After watching it, we can be sure there won't be any season 2. Cause they finished it beautifully. But still hoping for another season. You should also watch the lead actress's (Ji-hu)'s great masterpiece ""House of Hummingbird""",8
"It was not bad, but because Chong Sung is dead, I give a low grade. But It was worth seeing again and It was fun, but It could still be better and not so sad.",10
"I had enjoyed a lot. Which ever zombie movie ever seen which is full of thiller and fantastic startagy which makes me appreciate for giving more rather
I had never seen movie like this l have watched the movie 5 times again and again with full details of existing and excitement.",10
This series is very exciting and unpredictable. The actors were well chosen and played their roles beautifully. The series had a good social critique of the state of society.,10
"Very good series, covering the bullying problem in schools well.Not too reliant on CGI and no sugar coated happy ending that you get with American programmes/films.",9
"As a big consumer of zombie subgenere, I always look for new stuff, and I really enjoied this one. However, it must be seen in korean and with subtitles, otherwise, it's boring.",9
"Just your typical zombie movies like the ones in West, too much drama stupidity and no logic. They even say have you watch the movie Train to Busan? And still not learn anything from it, the police and soldiers aren't even using guns in the beginning episodes.",1
"This teenage zombie drama really is a piece of work. Usually when series are slow going i use the skip button to go 10 secs ahead in time. I did this from episode 4-12 (probably skipped 75%, and I feel like i didn't miss a thing. Overall the plot was manageable to follow, however far too stretched out. It seemed like these kids were completely braindead - as mentioned by other honest reviewers - and clearly noticeable(!).(Spoilers from here)
There is just too much to say about these characters! This one girl decides to kill a ""Welfie"", a boy who receives welfare payments, by infecting him intentionally (She seemed like a completely normal kid, however is now a psychopath murderer)? The other kid goes carelessly around killing anyone who says something barely considered mean? There is just too much here that doesn't feel thought out.I would compare this to me, 12 years of age, randomly scribbling down all my emotions and fantasies of action, chronologically, without even reading through it twice before submitting to the writers competition.",3
"I've always been a great fan of zombie shows, and was totally looking forward to this! Loved Train to Busan, Kingdom and had high hopes for this.Love
This show has great make-up effects, a fair amount of humour, and an interesting storyline. Story was unpredictable, and had good twists and turns.Hate
But throughout the movie, I felt irritated so many times by the poor decisions made by the characters - like seriously questionable kinds that resulted in unnecessary sacrifices.Overall a good show, but 4 stars deducted from that.",6
"A lot of k-drama fans too supportive about all k-dramas but this is kinda disappointed and STUPID. I'm sorry but usually Korean actors are great but in this series it's so embarrassing and awkward, storyline is stupid and even the zombie is faster but the story is too slow. 12 episodes of NONSENSE.",3
"Unfinished entanglements
Repetitive and boring scenes
Maybe this series is good for teenagers
But it is not good for adults at all because it is very artificial
Do not waste your time.",2
"This show is about as bad and nonsensical as ""Train to Busan"". It's another storyline for people who don't mind having every element spoonfed to them through tropes and stereotypes. It offers no new takes on zombies, Korea's bullying culture, cheesey romantic crushes, or the ability of those in charge to take action rather than cover up an issue. If you're looking for a quality zombie story, this will be 14 hours of your life misspent. It's almost as bad as ""Z Nation"" but without the failed attempts at humor.",2
"I think the director was forced to kill atleast one main character in each episode...literally one or 2 main character/s die in each of the episodes.....and the origin story was basically trash ,but the school plot was quiet interesting that makes you watch the whole season....so that is it....conclusion: the origin story could have been better.",7
"Decent zombie action but too much drama. What is 12 1 hour episodes could have been 6 45 minute episodes. Too much filler so after a couple episodes everything is too repetitive. The bullying trope is really corny and overdone. The main villain's motives are unrealistic. None of the characters are likeable. I think this show is overhyped because of the ""squid game"" momentum that Korean shows have. Overall it is a mid series.",3
"Undoubtedly koreans are the best. The story contains everything. Friendship, love, humanity, thrill, adventure, fear, cruelty. What else we need. Could nt find any single flaw in this series. And also each and every scene is delightful to watch. Right from first scene its been a terrific making from koreans. We have to agree.",10
"This Zombie show absolutely DID NOT disappoint! From the very jump you have a scene of a boy being bullied then turns Z. From there it gets a bit slow until about the end of the 2nd episode. I'm glad they showed us what happened and how the Zombies came to be even though it was slower. It showed us some of the students backgrounds, who was doing what, the love interest and gave it us context to to alot of what's going on and why.In one of the scenes they start to freak out once they realize there's zombies at the school and one of them even mentions "".. this is just like train to Busan!"" From that moment I was in love!! Every zombie show movie Iv ever seen they act like they've never seen a zombie film and they're all panicking on what to do. This one they acknowledged the zombies called them zombies and somewhat knew what to expect. There's a twist in how some of the infected act which I'm wondering will have to be a big part in season 2. Don't mind what these low rating reviews are saying it's a MUST watch especially if you're a zombie thriller fan! It just has a little of what everyone likes in a film. 10/10 kind cannot be changed!",10
"I just finished season 1 and I get the first 3-4 episode were meh... the kids made a lot of trash decisions. I do like a lot of apocalyptic movies/series, So its a 9/10 I know its to high but... well see how it goes with Season 2.",9
"Not usually a fan of zombie genre because I get annoyed by dumb decisions and obvious plot armors. But this one the dumb decisions can be excused because they're made by kids and most of the time the kids are pretty smart for their age and experience. I'm only annoyed by one bad guy being too OP, would've been 9 otherwise.Got hooked after 1 episode and it's interesting to see high shcool drama mixed with zombie outbreak.",8
Typical Zombie episodic show. They could have done this very well with a 2 hour movie skipping a lot of the unnecessary character subplots which were way too long. They even reference a Zombie flick Train to Busan. Acting for the most part was very good as well as the location shooting.,5
"Being an zombie movie how you can think to make it realistic. I think writer thought what if we face zombies as same as we faced covid..That lee na character you killed her in a funny way.. And then the father who fought so hard to reach and protect her daughter and you just give them hardly two minutes. She still remained the same with,You made the villain hero by killing cheosang.All of us are dead! How? You should kill all then, why some left
Complete disappointment..",5
"Recently South-Korea seems to be on a zombie streak. This has come with some great hits (Train to Busan and Kingdom) and some terrible misses. Unfortunately this show is more miss than hit.The first half of the show holds its own, as character deaths are swift and believable. The engine is chugging with proper tension, low on melodramatic scenes.Unfortunately the second half of the show, especially after the reveal of the halfbies, is rife with melodramatic scenes and long drawn out shots trying desperately to make the viewer sad. Very cheap tactics are used multiple times. (Parents of girl X die, mother of boy Y dies, and father of girl Z dies.)Another disappointment is the asymptomatic angle. It is never explored further than to find a tactic to lure zombies with high pitch noise. The last we see of the second halfbie is the lab being wiped clean.Initially I thought the halfbie angle could be interesting but it is never properly explored, except to serve us a recurring 80's Hollywood enemy. In the end I think they should have toned down the halfbie angle and gone with a more interesting approach of how to deal with asymptomatic carriers. It had a lot of potential.Unfortunately a lot of potential was wasted and there's no coming back from these choices in a potential season 2. I'll be waiting for the next season of Kingdom.4/10.",4
"What happens if you mix five doses of bullying, a handful of obnoxious school kids, one bad script+directing combo, bake it only halfway, and sprinkle some very light horror on top of it? You get a poorly made south-korean ""pop hit"" with overinflated reviews. I realize that south-korean drama has a different formula, a different flair to it, when compared to other countries' , but this just feels like Korean Bollywood. Sometimes, it feels like a Japanese advert director was giving ""pro tips"" off-camera.",2
"I had little expectation when I began streaming this show but am very pleased with it. It's about teenagers and there's campiness involved along with the drama. Very tongue in cheek which makes it a nice reprieve from all the over-the-top zombie action. Good character development, excellent dubbing, good storyline. Although the scene of the Captain's escape and swimming away amidst a crazy barrage of bullets with only one bullet barely grazing him made me laugh... that's why you can't take this so seriously. I also love the references to Train to Busan (which is one of the best zombie movies out there). This is very entertaining and worthwhile if you like this genre.",8
I've been watching zombie movies for 30 years. I have watched or attempted to watch every movie or show containing zombies.This one is definitely the worst. It's pointless and ridiculous nonsense. I could only watch the first episode and less than ten minutes of the second one.This show is bad beyond compare.,1
"This is a great zombie show, the inconsistencies some have complained about between the zombies is explained later as they state the virus is constantly changing and that's why there can be no cure.My biggest issue with this show is that on multiple occasions they use the typical annoying Hollywood scenarios where some character makes a dumb choice and screws things up for everyone.Also it's incredibly hard to watch scenarios like the kid on the roof who decided not to help at all when the rescue chopper comes.Could have been better no doubt, hopefully they'll improve for season 2.",8
"With any zombie movie or drama, you accept the basic premise of a fictious life form that does things that are unreal. However, it does get frustrating when the show is filled with unrealistic human behavior. The zombie outbreak at the school starts with a girl opening a cage that was rattling. I had a sense of deja vu since another zombie show, Kingdom, had two people fighting to the death, but stopping suddenly to open a rattling crate, which let out the... zombie... Are there that many people in this world who cannot resist opening something that rattles? Please, please... If you hear suspicious rattling from a box or crate, call the authorities or move away from it. Do NOT open the damn box!!!",5
"Very entertaining, the cinematography is pretty good and there were a lot of nice shots
The plot is very interesting, for once the main characters are not adults but young students so it was nice seeing a different point of view.Amazing the relationship between the characters, even if it is a series about survival and zombies it goes deep in the emotions of the characters, hope they'll make a second season cause I'd like to see more of them.",8
Sooo[ooooooobad. Please dont WASTE YOUR TIME LIKE I WASTED MINE. IT. IS. SO. BAD!!! Every charaxter is mega stupid. Most of the scenes were very awkward and clicheic. I think it is one of the worst tv series that i have watched in my entire life.,1
"I was looking forward to this as I am a huge fan of Korean zombie movies. Was very disappointed watching this.If you're looking for a movie with action, well thought out storyline and good character development this is not the show for you. If you are looking for a show about teenage angst and random plotlines that lead to nothing this is the show for you.I would only watch this if there was absolutely nothing else left on your list to watch.",2
"I don't know, I simply enjoyed it. I liked the teenage drama feel combined with gore and survival. Although I feel like there were too many unnecessary deaths, everyone was always sacraficing themselves, it was starting to get annoying.I hope we get a season 2 and a proper storyline for the ""half zombies""ps Cheong-san deserved better!",8
"At a time where the zombie apocalypse scenarios seems already saturated and overdone, there comes a show that breathes some new life (ironic, I know) into the genre.All of Us Are Dead is an extremely well-made show that nails pretty much everything it sets out to do. The action is almost constante and relentless, but they still find time to work some effective and really well written drama, excellent characters and even some goofy comedy scenes.There's a lot to love here, but I think what really makes this show works is the characters. In a similar vein to Stranger Things' first season, they managed to create some really compelling and emotionally engaged cast of characters. The teenagers are not unsufferable assholes like in most shows, instead they feel like real people, with real issues and strenghts, and you really want to see them succeed and escape.It's one of those shows merely talking about it doesn't really does it justice. It can even sound kind of dumb in paper, but once you see it action on the screen, you get mesmerized. The people behind this show really pulled off some bold and creative ideas that many other would've easily screw up.Especial credits must be given to the young cast of actors, who not only have stellar dramatic performance, but also some incredibly physical stunt work and zombie sequences.The only downsides I can think of are some (very) minor plot holes and the fact that the show does get a little tiny bit repectitive. Other than that, this is a must watch, especially for genre fans.",8
"Mostly dragging on to much, with wooden acting and just laughable dialogue. Its pretty boring most of the time, with hilarious scenes in which main characters dodge dozens of zombies in narrow corridors becaus plot armor. Emotional impact missing, some deaths just random and some ... lets say weird superpowers. If one had started to fly at the end, I would not hav been surprised.Made it to episode 6 before checking out.It is well crafted in some regards, hence a 6 out of 10. But you won't miss out much if you don't watch it.",6
"Not sure how this got 7.7.It's not ""that bad"" but it's also not very good either. Everything gets very repetitive and/or very ridiculous VERY quickly, and this is someone that stuck with the dumpster fire TWD until the end.This review is totally ignoring how the writers chose at PURE WILL to FIT THEIR MEDIOCRE scripts just how long it takes to turn into a zombie after being bitten. 5 seconds? Yeah sure, if it fits the script. 5 minutes? Yeah sure, if it fits the script and the person bitten needs to give an emotional goodbye,Not a terrible show, not a very good one either.",5
"The dialogue gets a lot of criticism, but as a teacher in S. K. it's on par with the speak. Their interactions, barring the two psychos, is everyday here. The only criticism I have is to the episodes. Episode 11 was the perfect send off for the show - dark, mysterious and ambiguous. They pushed forward and made a twelfth which not only had a different, child like tone; where all dread, fear and the doom had been replaced by joyful wonder. The first 11 episodes took place in a 3 day run. I know that childhood conditioning is rife here and that'd take some time to overcome or break free from, but the 12th episode is 3 months later. These children who've experienced the darkest situations should no longer approach life like children.Let's just say...if you watch till the end you can expect disappointment.",9
"Slow, bad acting, boring, unexplained things happen and bad writing and redacting.Instead of enjoying the series, you end up with a super bad day and angry because of that.",1
"It's about 12 hrs long but never let us felt that, very engaging. The cinematography is outstanding whenever there's a chasing sequence, my god it's feels so good, the camera angle. The little love story is good. Hope makers will release it's part 2 very soon.",10
"I liked the series. Especially viewing how Korean kids typically behave in their normal environment.As to the zombies, they are pretty standard and the kids make the same moves as in most zombie flicks. Ex: staring for seconds too long before reacting, then jumping in to sacrifice themselves, etc Basically, what kids would likely NOT do.But I still enjoyed it immensely. It's a fast paced energy thrill ride.",8
"The series has a good idea, it has a nice photograph but it fails to prolong characters like the villain of the series in addition to completely silly and dumb characters.",5
"The moral of this story? Good guys (people) finish last.I love zombie flicks and South Korea made one of my all-time favorites: you guessed it... Train to Busan. But here they've taken an ENDLESS amount of time with character development, but why? To get us to like the characters so that it stings even worse when they kill them off? Yeah, I know lots of dead characters is to be expected, but they spend 11-ish hours on character development and it just feels like they're torturing us.I'm almost done with the series. I watched it all because currently there was nothing else on Netflix any better. But I didn't enjoy it as much as I wanted to.",6
"This's the slowest series I've ever seen in my whole like, even if this series was 4 episodes long it will still be a waste of time. I swear I completed the whole series in 2 hours by just skipping most of the scenes, btw I regret wasting these 2 hours.",2
"Kinda seems like they borrowed from the anime heavily and just toned down innuendo. On its own merits and typical of Korean zombie films, character development is darn good. I cared about them. Some of the slang and moments of emotion will miss the mark on American audiences. Cultural differences I suppose.I would definitely watch a 2nd season to see how things move forward. Pacing was good after the second episode. It's entertaining and at times campy but I liked it.",8
"The action of the zombies in this show is very realistic. It is interesting to watch the relationship between friends. Well executed until the middle of the series. From the ridiculous lines, to the moronic ""decisions"" to the horrible way they treated some characters. The typical Netflix-style ending was a bit disappointing, but I really enjoyed this show.",8
"A series which is scary , emotional , and love story .A perfect combination!You will definitely connect with the characters .Good cinematography .Best camera anglesBest visual effectsBest camera qualityStoryline is bestEverything is goodYou should watch this series .",10
"For a group of high school students who actually figured out its a zombie apocalypse like train to busan from the first episode, their IQ and repeated behavior in the next episodes can make anyone with common sense cringe .Still if u like some gore, action and little humor here and there yeah give it a shot.",5
"Koreans have been making some pretty decent stuff lately, biggest example squid games. Last few years they been making some great stuff. This year they already came out with 2 different shows including this one im writting about. This was pretty well done, had some flaws with it that is considered tv show mistakes. Had lots of things I remember thinking why can't he do it but she can? So some flaws they did not see but other then that had decent story pretty good characters not huge development on them but still had some, id consider this show more action but was still really good and always kept my attention. Im really bad at reviews and writting in general so I hope people really looking for an awnser can understand what I was trying to say ( if not clear)",7
"The unique thing about this series is, I think the first time ever happen since I watched the first zombie movie is it happen in the world where everyone know about zombie from movie. Its not like The Walking Dead where they dont call them zombie because in their world, zombie never exist, not even in movie. But, in this korean series, they call them ""zombie"" from the beginning. Sacrifice and responsibility plays a big role in this series, when people live in desperation, they never left their side of humanity. That's what make this series fun. Its a fun zombie movie with a lot of action and cliche from all zombie movie in history. Have fun.",7
"I'm on episode 6 and I'm hooked because of the drama with strong sociopolitical messages, not because of the zombies.And Yes...it's long, but who cares? Why you want it to finish it so fast? Take a chill pill and be grateful it's as long as it is good too.Also, for the animals that complain about having filler, guess what?, fillers are intended for character development and world-building support.",9
"The storyline is ok, it points out bullying, cruelty of humans, but some of characters are just too stupid.They just stand there, not reacting every time there is an attack, especially the girls.Only the girl with an arrow knows how to kill the zombies, the rest just carry useless weapons like long sticks, and the annoying thing is most of them don't use it to aim the head (come on it's a zombie ??)-Useless death for some characters to make it more dramatic and sad.Poor decisions of characters that make you annoyed to death.",5
"I am 22 years old. I grew up with Dawn of the Dead, and I must say, this show is far better. It's like taking a bland dish and adding the right spices to it to make an even better dish; sorry DOTD fans, I still love DOTD, but it's no longer my favorite apocalypse film; it will go down in history as the best of it's time.I am a huge fan of the Beastars. Just an FYI, I know that this film takes place in Korea while the Beastars Netflix Series takes place in Japan, but the High School setting; the mystery theme of who or what is behind a killing, the character's voices/mannerisms and even their uniform remind me of the Beastars; the hero dude Cheogsan who has a secret crush on Onjo reminds me of Legoshi and Haru for instance.This is hands down the BEST zombie-apocalypse movie-series of all time. I call it a movie series because the episodes are like movie segments, that really don't feel like they're a hour long. It's absolutely hilarious too. I've so far watched 3 episodes. I would hate to spoil it for those who want to see a Sci-Fi masterpiece that still managed to be original. The character arcs are gripping, and you grow an attachment to the main characters really quickly.Since it's full of gore, I'd say it's best fit for ages 17 and up.In many ways, the zombie-virus reminds me of COVID, but is way worse than covid; Contagion's virus was eerily just like coronavirus too, but again not as terrifying as the one on this show. Made me think, ""Maybe Covid isn't so bad,"" and the importance of our modern-day technology!The animation is intense, so-much-so that you forget this is just a movie. If you watch it long enough, you actually start to feel there; the makeup and animation is simply so compelling. Immediately, when you begin to watch it, you're HOOKED. You'll feel empathy, fear, suspense, and amusement AT ONCE. Every single character on here is interesting and talented; both the actors on the screen, and the voice-over actors; you can't even tell that it's a voice over, and I really had to study their lip movements, which still seem to be in sync; you seriously WON'T notice it very much at all.You'll be determined to see what happens to all of them, and if they make it out because the title itself just draws people in. It is brilliant. Every single shot and angle is perfectly paced in line with the story. I never feel like characters stall or are dragging the time, like I've seen with even some Disney+ Originals; move aside Disney and take some notes, because Netflix Originals did it AGAIN with another masterpiece.It is bound to jerk some tears of sadness or shock, or make you cry laughing. You seriously can't get bored with this one - even I can't and I am attention-deficient. This is definitely binge-watchable if you can stomach the realisticness of the gore and suspense. Sometimes I even forgot that the characters can't hear me through the screen when they're unbeknowst of a zombie's approaching. I can see why this made the top 10, but this baby could go in a top 3 tier list. I have yet to find something that comes as close to it!",10
"I'll keep it short, the film is action-packed and thrilling - minus the first episode. So you really have to live through the pilot where the writers basically wanted the viewers to get a sense of the show's mood. Honestly, it felt a little unnecessary... Nevertheless, the succeeding episodes were heart-pumping. I didn't want to stop watching at 3 am.Anyway, the problem is not if it lives up to Train to Busan, because of course it won't. Different setting, tone and character focus. But the issue is how the writers only make characters likeable the moment they're about to cut them off.Believe me, I love an emotional character death but to kill of the interesting ones that the audience root for at such an early stage is just annoying. At least semi-develop the other nobodies before killing the charming ones. Other than that, the show's pretty good.I have to comment the casting too. I don't know Korea's standards but WOW everyone's so good. Even the random child saved by the police had great acting skills. So yeah, that made the experience more terrifying.Hoping for season 2. ???? Give me someone to root for from episode 1 to... at least episode 5-6.",7
"This is one of best zombie series I have ever seen, I love the South Korean take on the zombie genre. Extremely well done makeup and special effects and refreshingly unique story line.",9
"A teacher who would rather save a psychotic murderous student than 7-8 normal kids who clearly need adult supervision and guidance.A mother who runs into a zombie apocalypse, and starts calling out zombies and then gets killed basically achieving nothingA so called bright student who clearly notices a fellow student infect a kind poor kid, but does nothing to stop it, waits for the kid to get infected and die, and then calls out the psycho as if she did anyone any favor.Characters who are so shocked all the time, they won't even move when a zombie horde is coming at themBasically if you can think of all the idiotic decisions someone can take during a zombie apocalypse, they are all taken here.The writers use cheap emotional tricks to get you invested. If your characters exist only to take stupid decisions so that you can create manufacturered drama instead of organic ones, you failed as a writer.May be some like that, but i personally hate this show.",1
"Stupid, incomprehensible. Addictive. Guilty pleasure.The characters are incomprehensible , unsympathetic and weepy. The action is nice. Nonetheless i couldn't stop to watch it, like a bad accident you can not look away.",3
"Budget looks good to make a well zombie tv season but what lacks is the direction and story telling! No focus on a single character and the character which they focus on are useless and get executed, giving a useless story telling and screenplay. Didn't feel any adrenaline rush or scare. No powerful character, gets boring in between. Expected more from this high budget Netflix series and Korean drama.",1
"The plot is so fake like one moment they are just students and the second later they become super ninja letal killer
Also the characters are all so stereotyped is annoying!",1
This is definitely an amazing fun flick. So many good things and the direction is good. Characters are so good with acting and body language. Nice gore and bloody zombies. Good makeup and sweetly satisfying show.,8
"The one thing that makes me rate this show higher than most zombie shows, is the lack of stupidity needed to advance the plot.Sure, teenagers in a high stress situation make mistakes, but realistic and understandable ones.The higher ups have some hard decisions to make and are realistically conflicted about it.Even the highschool drama makes sense to me.",8
This is patchy but intriguing. It has some of the most horrific Zombie moments without having to go full Walking Dead gore fest. For the me most interesting aspects were the traditional Korean cultural values (especially family) juxtaposed to what we see in western versions of this genre. My hero was the commander - his medical protocol Vs family (in the age of COVID) was a better take than shows like Contagion.,8
This is one of the best web series. In starting 1st and 2nd episode was lil boring but it makes your interest in series and after that you connect with the characters and it's one of the best experience. This series was tooooo good.,10
"I was deeply impressed by the performance of South Korean zombie movie 'Train To Busan' in 2016. The acting of zombie was mind-blown to me. And I was looking forward to another thrilling and breath-taking survival story. However, in this case, the performance of the zombie actors is the only saving grace of this show, the illogical plot and acting of 'the living' have ruined this show entirely.There is one scene in ep2, 'the living' are running away from fierce zombie hordes. They barely make it to a classroom surrounded by glass windows. You heard me right, thin layers of glass window are the only thing between 'the living' and zombie hordes. And yet, they still can turn their back on horde of zombies outside the classroom, fall into an argument with one another for some meaningless, non-urgent issues that nobody cares. 'The living' are acting way too calm that not even a single one of them is having an eye on the zombies pounding on their windows and doors. It feels like they are living in a parallel world, and what is happening outside has nothing to do with them. It is unreasonable and far from what I anticipated.The performance of zombie actors is respectable, I can see they are putting a lot of effort on creating a sense of terror and thrilling, but that is about it. Even the terrifying zombie cannot save the terrible plots.",3
"The Movies should be an example for real life, but this movie show a bad morality in each character on their movies. It's a shame, a movie like this should be able to set a good moral example for the audience.So many korean movies like this.",1
"Im in a rush so ill be shortThe cinematic language of this series is all over the place. They enphazise moments with camera and script that end up being for nothing leaving a feeling of unfinishness... Also, most of the deaths are meaningless which would be nice if that was a premise, but its not. So most characters die without having their arch finished or even developed, like the girl who tried to bring food to the rooftop. The pacing of these deaths were also weird. Most of them had very little development or build up, which is normal for a secondary character, but why dies the mom go to the school just to die and then carry on with the series like nothing happened just to have Cheong-san find her in the lasts episode... like dont show me her death if there's no purpose (narratively speaking). Cuz the feelings, intentions and purpose of her deaths gets thrown away for the rest of the series just to have such a superficial aspect at the end. That can be said for most of the characters.And then when a truly important character dies theres nothing to say of them, they just die and end of story, even our protagonist dies without doing anything with the antagonists and we dont even see he's actual deaths... just boom: end.There's also many times where I felt they left something open for developement like weird zombies or the lantern, which only purpose (of the lantern) was for the daughter of the firefighter to find it later and have 3 seconds of her crying and then tell her father's partner he's dead in a very anticlimactic way...On the other hand it's pretty enterteining, won't elaborate the cons anymore actually since i see the review section full of people who point out the strong points of this drama.Either way i enjoyed it, the tensions was a bit too much for me in the first episodes so the tone got messed up when they suddenly introduce some comic relief after the first half... Like i needed that a long time ago instead of constant running, tension and hiding. Plus they could have gone other places too, the narrative doesn't even grasp that so its a pretty conscious decison, but the screen writer could have thought of exploring more other characters, backgrounds and places... perhaps the protagonists could have escaped a lot sooner cuz, for me, it got to a point where i was like ok... they're trapped again... brilliant... more of the sameI insist, I enjoyed it, it was enterteining even if i just focused on the negative.PD: Sory for my horrible writting and meesy structure, im in a rush. :)",7
"Very thrilling and emotional for me. If you lose everyone you love very truly, and still you are not able to do anything, this hurts very much. I think this webseries is for strong hearted people where lot of violence is present.",10
"Really a most horrific,most entertaining and most humoric web series that i have ever seen. All actors works are brilliant and that is the reason this web series pre production work is very good. Also post production work are superb. So, it is really a suprb interesting and horrific webseries. Thank you.",10
"Going into it i was really not sceptical as the series was 12 episodes (each episode having 45+ runtime), and the series does lag in the middle but at the end its a good series. Acting is not bad , zombies are part we seen before and part new things. Worth a watch go for it if you have time. After watching this i really miss the series named ' Sweet Home ' which i hope Netflix renews for a new season .",7
"The vibe I got from the trailer was that of a censored version of The highschool of dead anime. However, its superior in every aspects. Even though the story has a major plot hole but the background score, cinematography and stunts completely filled those voids. The sense of story telling with the aspect of time is a major win for this series. But the prospect of a thick plot and dense character study looses all its volume with a hurried ending. I would not say that its a ""must watch"" but a ""good watch"" indeed.",7
IT'S A FANTASTIC WEB SERIES AS I EXCEPT FROM KDRAMA ZOMBIE SERIES. THIS IS THE ONE OF THE BEST SERIES I EVER WATCH AND BEST IN ZOMBIE. I RECOMMEND YOU TO WATCH BUT IT'S EPISODES IS TO LONG CONSIST OF 12 EPISODES.,10
"My expectation for the show was higher than what it turned out to be. The storyline was good, however, felt like it way too stretched that it should've been. The reason to create that virus that made the people zombie was that satisfactory. This shows the cruelty the victims face from the people they expect to aid them. The romance they tried to create in this show was not something appreciative at all. As the romance was not even a bit exciting all along the show. You can watch it if you have time it's a mid tier apocalyptic show.The ending was a cliffhanger and it was a nice exciting one hopefully they can bring out the next season and make it a good one. However, my expectations are not that high as I don't think there can be something more added to make the story better.",6
"All of Us Are Dead is fine.But it is a conceptually very juvenile show. The whole origin of the epidemic is difficult to digest. This series has a certain bizarre tone, that tries to balance the drama, comedy and action-horror, but it doesn't always work. Or it won't work for everyone the same way.Having said this. I had fun. The various points of view on the zombie apocalypse are very well made. Action scenes are great. And the overall production value is pretty decent. There are several characters I liked, and I was sorry to see some of them being dismembered.Despite having some problems with the more childish elements of the narrative, this series, in general, provided me with good times.But it's definitely not as refined as Squid Game. Despite being very ambitious in its proposal.I rate this series 7.5 out of 10.",7
"The show starts, in netflix-esque fashion, with a event that would never happen like that in a natural situation. This show boils down to overdrawn characters and teenagers being teenagers. Don't waste your time on this fine looking but poor written piece.",1
"Honestly, everything is almost perfect but the reason I can't give two more star is when the character fall over and trip again a few times. Second is when certain character decided to sacrifice themselves in hope to help the other but it's just getting me pain. As example, when Cheong-san mother secretly arrived at the school, she called his son friend that already got bitten and I was shouting stoopid so loudly in front of my camera. Furthermore this drama drive me up the wall when Na-yeon murdered Cheong-san friend with a wipe of handkerchief that contain zombies blood and then all the hateful moments appears a lot and more to come. She is the cause of why the group created negative vibes and I hate it but I know every survival movies will always have that person. Anyway it's worth to watch it and I've just finished this drama in four days. VERY RECOMMENDED! *of course we are waiting for SEASON 2, IT MUST HAVE, because the ending keep me hanging and questioning.......",8
"Good action, good zombie performance, but that's all. The real problem of the show is its logic, I will pick a few points to talk about but there's way more. 1. The firefighter fought all the way to the arsenal in the police station, but he only took one gun? Is it really that heavy to take more? More ironically, the only gun he had was taken by a weak man, and he did not even bother to take the gun back! 2. Every time things get a little emotional, the characters had to shout even there were lots of zombies around, its like they were afraid zombies don't know where they are. 3 What's the point of the sacrifice of the firefighter? Could he not throw one or two sticks far to draw away the zombies and then run out fast and then lock the door from outside, I think that's totally possible. 4 The girl had a wooden spike, she could have used it to kill dozens of zombies, but instead she waved it around like a normal stick, if you cant use it right, cant you give it to another man?",6
"I must create new account to make a review for this.Again and again, why all zombie movies treat character as no-brainer ? I know that this is unreal world, but character is human, and human has brain to actually think ?What they do ? Shout out to invite zombie to come to them ? Lol, is this joke ?Let's try again, to make this genre better, at least treat character as normal human , is it possible ? Or zombie genre means human is not human after all ?",1
Thank you so much for these masterpiece. I have seen Many zombie film or series but these series is another level. I enjoyed hole day watching these masterpiece.,10
"I could not get past ep 4.I'm sure this is entertaining for the people who can turn off their brain and just enjoy but Im just not one of them.Be warned, some survivers make really stupid decisions, it was painful to watch. Hard to relate or root for the characters because of that.Be warned, some survivers will make some really really stupid decision that are quite painful to witness.",5
"Very much disappointed from a Korean zombie series. Nothing interesting at all. Kingdom was the best zombie series till now, nothing match that level in any manner. Waste of time, if you missed it no big deal at all. If you have lots of time just watch it and Waste your precious time.",5
The plot and direction are great!also there is some goofs on series!I don't think that it's necessary to kill most of the team in their way to home!i looking for the better ending but i discouraged in episode 11.Can't wait to watch the next season with better endings.,9
The zombies are good. But honestly all of those kids should be dead within the first 5 minutes from their decision making. Everything else seemed unrealistic.,3
"Exceptional! If you loved Train to Busan, you're going to like this one too. It might not be moving as fast as the movie since it's a series after all. But acting, storytelling etc. Have been executed well. And you cannot really predict what's going to happen in the next episode!",8
"Actually I love the concept that director use as a high school student becoming a zombie I love the concept Love this series
Please renewed the series for season 2
This is the request form a fan.",10
"As a full grown adult i have to say that this was major flop! My spouse was also complaining how slow, how unrealistic, how stupid behvior the teenagers had and again that how slow it was. 6 episode would have been much better. Also, the zombies movements and acting was way more better than any of the teenager actors/actresses. I have feelings that positive reviews are mainly from the teenagers who happen to be Korean movies& Zombie fans.",2
"There's some really fun zombie action in here. The way they turn is violent and well-made, and camera and sound are great! That is about it though.The dialogue is mostly a cringe fest, the decisions the characters make are even too dumb for high schoolers and the story is slow and just really meh.There's also some attempts at humour, but those shots mostly miss, like 99% of the time.Can't recommend, except if you have absolutely nothing else to watch.",5
Good story but they don't rally dragged it out. Chronic overuse of the people running and falling. I don't think Koreans are as inept at running as they portray. My gosh not one person could run without stumbling.,6
"Having seen shows and movies like ""Goblin,"" ""Squid Game,"" ""Miracle in Cell Number 7,"" ""Train to Busan,"" ""The Flu,"" ""Love in the Moonlight,"" ""Kingdom"" and the Philippine made ""Block Z,"" I can definitely say that ""All of Us Are Dead"" is one of the most okay yet overhyped Korean series and Zombie flick on social media. Featuring storylines and premises done better in the movies and shows I have mentioned - like drama, romance and Zombies in a campus - the series is predictable and only adds one thing new: the ""Halfbies.""",7
"Finnaly the zombie korean series involving high schooler is here. The plot of every episode is solid, not too slow and not too fast. The thriller chased by zombie is pump up my hearbeat.",9
"I am a fan of zombies and Korean movie industry has built some good reputation in this matter. BUT this series may have pulled down the reputation because this series is so bad such that I wonder if it was directed by teenagers.Bad acting!Good thing is that the mystery got explained very soon in the second episode (if you can go that far).Those creepy/zombie scenes are totally predictable and common in a zombie-themed series/move so they can't be constituted as a reason to give applause to this series.Too many scenes are not logical at all. For instance when Onju was pressed against the floor by a infected male student, what should be expected is she simply can be bitten. But no, apparently she holds the fight and get away with the zombie. But wait! One second ago she is too terrified to move and next second she fights back the zombie.And the extinguisher can also defeat zombies?It just a tip of iceberg showing how bad this series.",5
"As korean i was disappointed.The original webtoon is more great than it.All story is boring.And it is cliché lump
There are too many useless scene.I don't know why this drama is NETFLIX 1st.It is just for killing time.",7
"Binge watched it in 2 days. I love the fact that it had mutations of the virus and kept me on the edge of my seat with some of the episode's cliffhangers.. I'm really annoyed that they didn't seem to even try to find food or water even after acknowledging that lack of water would kill them. However, I love how smart some of the characters were and some of the things they came up with to get from room to room.",9
"This show is like The Walking Dead, but instead of 70% of the cast being totally uninteresting, useless, and annoying, 100% manages to live up to that lame standard. It reminds me of the rubbish programming that Netflix used to provide about five years ago. Back when people were canceling their memberships in mass.",2
"It's an amazing series it's my personal favourite series
Perfect cast, perfect storyline with hint of friendship, perfect location, perfect concept
It's just perfect of all????",10
"Good premises of a zombie apocalypse setup. Generally good acting but the whole coming-of-age mixed in really dragged down the show.It's zombie apocalypse we do not have time for young brats' love quarrel and other emotional stupidity. Many parts we fast-forwaded to skip the boring cheesy moment that are suppose to be emotional. They felt completely out of place. Lot of sub-plots were not done in enough details and felt like just fillers.And I meant it is a zombie apocalypse show we are not expecting it to be 100% realistic, but when you have the main casts happily chatting with each other after two-three days of no water and food, zombies suddenly chase flare for no reason, and certain roles took forever to fully turn into zombie after being bitten, you know something is wrong about the script.",5
"Series named as adult drama but incidents happening from school. But teenages acted as matured adults. Faults are though; I feel some unnecessary feelings injected on the 2nd or 3rd episode of the series. 7 kids vs atleast 60 powerful zombies in a classroom with a barricade. Actress's dad entry is not satisfying. They skipped so fast. Incubation period varies from 2 seconds to 1 week... Why?Otherwise overall series is a good... Cinematography, casting and making of the series are one of the best in industry. I have just 7 questions suggestions about the series that is I mentioned above.",8
"Great! Series! I love it! I finish this season in 2days because i excited what happen next episode
all I can say is make season 2 even better so that the ratings and good reviews of the viewers will increase even more.",9
All of us are dead movie is not just k drama movie it is a horror and goosebumps movie. It will give you just goosebumps. I just loved this movie and I am now exited for season 2.,10
"Half-baked story, good effects, bad realization.One logical fault follows by the next. I got annoyed too many times while watching the series. The series is very predictable. I was very disappointed.",5
"While I do like this netflix series, there was a mistake on episode 12 wherein Wu-Jin is alive again after he died on episode 11. But they killed him again maybe because of this mistake.",8
"I thought the zombie acting was very realistic, from the growling, to the walking on the floor like the exorcist, and their joints cracking. I loved that most of the kids that survived had a connection with a least another student aside from On-jos dad that ended up dying, that's what made it so emotional. That's the part of the story line that kept me watching. The only thing I disliked and I thought was like kind of dumb about this story, is the fact that this science teacher started a whole ass pandemic due to his son getting bullied ? I don't condemn that kind of behavior from anyone of course. And he needed to do something about it. However, creating a virus because of it, it's the dumbest most selfish thing I've ever heard.",7
"This was a massively will done show, the stories were good the effects were nice and the goriness was what you'd expect from a good zombie show..
Watch it and enjoy..
Well done ??",9
I fell in love with this series from the first time I saw its trailer. I liked it. South Korea is making a lot of progress in the film industry. Thank you for your good films from Iran.???????,10
It's fun! The main characters were escaping throughout the series only to be trapped. At last they finally escape with losing some of their friends. A freaking YouTuber makes us laugh! Jae-ik and the man are a good comedic duo. Gwi-nam is a freaking character and also he keeps the series interesting. It will be great. Cheong-San's death brings up tears. Overall the best zombie series.,9
"I fell in love with this movie from the 1st time watching the 1st episode. I got hook-up with the plot and finished this series within only 2 days. 9 episodes on the 1st day and 3 episodes the following day.Credit to all the hard work and the creative art presented in this series. I must say, exceptional acting, excellent directorship, great casting, cinematography, videography, deep script, editing, and the make-up artist are all incredibly appreciable.The storyline started to get intense from the beginning till the end. The crisis is presented in the form of the zombies caused by the Jonas virus.I love how they presented various characters of human beings when facing a crisis, and in this case, it is between life & death.Selfishness & selflessness are conveyed meticulously in every character. The human survival instinct influences human action, especially in the end, where the human-centric point of view decides to save humanity from extinction and sacrifices other beings as collateral damage.I love how every crucial message and critical learning are conveyed to the viewers. The issues with inequality treatment, bullies, minorities, politics, fear, bold, and proactive were included.I can't wait for the 2nd season to come. I did watch other zombie TV series, but none are this great after Train to Busan.",10
"After getting impressed by Kingdom, I was excited to watch another zombie movie by South Korea and this time set in high school premises. I really loved it tbh.. I don't know why people are giving it lower ratings. It kept me hooked to my Tv all the time... so gripping. Also the zombie action and graphic scenes are amazing n seems real. The zombie makeup is quite good. Although it was really hard to see my favourite characters die. Things you don't expect happened in this series I highly recommend you guys to watch it.",10
"Seeing this on Netflix trending list I expected something watchable, not some dumb zombie series in which every character behaves like a zombie even before they become one.",5
"I am a fan of zombie movies and series... you name it and probably I have seen it... Korean zombie concept is always high impact fast moving ones and this one was no exception to ""Kingdom"" or ""Train to Busan.Having said that, this series doesn't deliver anything more than an average story. Originality of virus unclear, acting mediocre, ending typical. Tries to introduce some novel concept like ""intelligent zombie"" but could have been better.But still I gave 7/10 just because the plot was better executed than many other zombie series... a good one time watch probably. Notjing more.",7
"I really enjoyed this series, some of the character arcs were really good amongst some one dimensional characters and this obviously helped. The reason for the start of the pandemic was well thought out and it gave a good start to the story. A few of the episodes probably weren't necessary and filled the series out longer than it probably should have been.If you like Zombies with a small touch of humour in places then check this out and don't take it too seriously, like most Zombie fodder it's best to not use your brain too much.",8
I don't like how some of the students are so stupid. Less action as well. I like how Koreans make good and hyper zombies but when it comes to some parts of the script? Boring.,6
"All of Us Are Dead doesn't disappoint if you (like me) like a zombie film/series. There's plenty of zombie action and lots of gore, it's a fun show.Just don't expect too much from it, it's a zombie series after all, it's not meant to be taken that seriously. I found it to be an entertaining watch - good cinematography, effects, acting and direction.It has its flaws, the biggest one for me being that there isn't really much of a narrative there, it's just a lot of ""oh no, there are zombies trying to get us, we must escape"" kind of thing, but I still liked it for what it was.If you like the genre then you'll probably enjoy it, if not, don't watch it.",7
"Acting was sub par even for a teenage Korean series. The female lead has exactly one expression. All characters behave in the most irrational ways possible. The whole refugee camp arc has nothing to do with anything at all. The pace of the series was so slow and nonsensical that you can skip most of the boring, script-reading scenes.",4
"From start to end, stupidity... Stupidity..... Stupidity.Senseless.Meaningless
Predictable
Overrated
Craze about Korean looks might have created buzz.",3
Best zombie series. Korean zombie movies are the best..... Amazing series.. not feel bored in between n very interesting... I am waiting for season 2.,10
"First things first, this series has insane amount of gore. So it's a warning, anyone who is sensitive or cannot tolerate gore should stay away from this series.When I finished 2 episodes of this series I thought, ""what is new? It's that usual zombie survival series that Korea produces every year"". I felt it was like ALIVE but set in a school rather than apartment. Moving further into the series I realized, it is not usual.Zombie survival series are always interesting no matter how old they become. Having watched so many zombie based films/series, I now find those snarling open mouthed zombies absolutely hilarious. Either they look disgusting or they look hilarious.However, what makes this series so different from the other zombie ones are these:-1. The fact that it deals with the mental state of the bullied school kids who get no help or comfort, like how Eu-Jin wishes the school burns down and everyone gets killed after her being bullied. This results in grave consequences later in this series watch out for that.2. The fact that the zombie virus is justified this time. Most of the time we get only a faint detail of the infection but this time, through the videos of the professor, we get to witness a lot of details about the virus.3. The fact that the makers have decided to introduce a new kind of zombie into the series which later turns into a grave danger for all.There are many more new elements in this series and that's a huge plus point for a genre that normally doesn't get much different treatment.Loopholes, quite a lot including some really illogical scenes that I could not help but scratch my head at those points and the fact that the series is unnecessarily stretched. Each episode is about more than an hour long (honestly, it is just 1 hr on average considering credits start playing with 5 mins left at end) and there are 12 episodes. You really feel the drag when the student gang talk and share their feelings amongst themselves on a rooftop and these were some parts I genuinely skipped.Overall, I think the makers did a good job by introducing new unique elements into this zombie series otherwise I was ready to bash up this series left and right had it been that usual zombie survival series that are available in millions on Netflix.",8
The web series experience was very nice. It automatically connects to teenagers. All characters are revining in my mind. I was cried at last two episodes. Humbly requesting the Netflix to release season 2 as soon as possible. Please.,10
"Now I loved TWD in the early seasons but after the departure of glen then Carl and the final straw Rick it became boring and soap opera so after seeing the trailer for all of us are dead I was intrigued into wether this could fill my zombie void and I'm glad to say it did,this series had some great new takes on the zombie virus and executed them well the story can become slow paced at times but the effects stunts and action is a joy to watch,12 1 hour episodes is a long stretch but I enjoyed most of it and shall look forward to season 2.",8
"A lot of zombie stuff has been done and there's only so much creativity you can come up with if it's already been done. So, when someone comes up with a new show, it's intriguing because I'm curious to see what's different about this one. This show is your typical Zombie but story set in a high school. It's got something for everyone.The zombie parts of the show were done REALLY WELL. Acting, action choreography, sound design, cinematography - everything was top-notch. Then there's your typical high school story that was a hit/miss. There's commentary on the society & family values - this added depth to the plot.Overall - it's a decent show with a lot of thrills but with minor pacing issues here and there, think Marvel trying to insert random jokes just because they can. They work, but seem out of place. The show has 12 eps, so this is a decent commitment. Could have been 8 eps, maybe 9.If you go down this road, you'll leave satisfied/non-disappointed by the end. If you'll be mind blown or not, is up to your taste.",7
"I love Zombie shows but was sceptic about this one as the reviews weren't impressive. I watched first episode, and it was okay , second became better and by the 3rd I was hooked. It was non stop action from there....literally non stop. I finished it in 3 days. Well done Korea as always!",10
How can you rate one out of ten and state in your review that you only watched ten minutes?This is very well made with great acting and direction. It reminds me of the first season of Walking Dead for its edge of the seat action. Some nice twists on the whole zombie idea also. I can't wait for the next season.,9
"Not sure what to make about the people giving this rave reviews. My guess is they're really young or just paid accounts. This series was very disappointing (as usual with Netflix). Poorly written, acted and execution. If you're looking for the next Squid Game this ain't it. Not by a wide mile. Trust me on this, skip this low budget trash.",2
"I won't write too much about this drama. The acting is decent. The script is OK - if you're watching with English dub, and the direction and editing are worthy of note but, at the end of the day, this is just another example of a production attempting to instill the idea that humans are violent.Episode 4 spells it out, without trying to hide it.Humans are inherently bad, so life without a governing body is wrought with danger.Whatever happened to the idea - possibly born in the 60's, or earlier - that humanity is inherently good?There are only a very small minority who find satisfaction in causing harm to the rest. Most humans would rather love their neighbour, not hate.Good idea for a show, if you're not bored with zombies, but we should all long for the day when writers realise that the public are not idiots, who fall for the idea that every human has evil at heart. Or is this just an attempt to make every human evil, whether they intend to be or not?It isn't just Hollyweird trying this approach, apparently.Try harder, Korea. You may find social realism - i.e. Actual social realism - more rewarding for the audience.",7
"At first i assumed that this was overhyped and going to be cheesy but i was pleasantly surprised. There are enough original takes in this series to make it worthwhile. I Just felt the end was a bit rushed and then stretched (you will know what i mean). After an episode or two i was addicted to it and had to keep myself from bingewatching it till the end. Half of the characters actually think rationally during this whole ordeal even the army people. I very much enjoyed that. I also liked that it wasnt American and thus no over the top macho BS. I think the story is finished but i do see some Angles which may justify a second season. Overall definitely worth watching even if you are not a fan of asian-export products like k-pop, manga and stuff like that.",8
"Well, as a Netflix production, this is way better than this piece of garbage that is Squid Game, (probably because it is based on a webtoon, so they already had the origin material) but I would not call it best tv series of 2022!The characters lack a bit of personality and charisma, and there's unecessary teenage drama too. Most of the characters and events are predictable, there's no surprises.Still, it is a decent show to watch, but I had to fast forward lot of boring stuff.There are way better Korean TV series out there! (Taxi driver, Signal, Hapiness, Sweet Home, Strangers from Hell, Uncanny Counter, Mouse etc...)",6
"Okay, so I started watching this series because me and my girlfriend kinda like zombie series.Korean is a weird language for us and the names are very hard to remember since (for me) they look all the same. I'm from The Netherlands. Me and my girlfriend didn't know who was who. It's difficult to explain but that made it very hard for us to follow the characters and their storyline. Also, the first scene was very strange and hard to watch. I hate bullying but this was from another level. Then I read Online that these kind of behaviour is kinda normal in Korea. That shocked us. Then girls were beaten by guys and raped. That just absolutely isn't fun to watch.I watched three episodes. It was very slow-paced, cruel and felt weird. Train to busan (a very good Korean Zombie movie) was a lot better because it was character driven and there were just a few characters who had easy names to remember.This flick felt like a very cruel and bad script. We both wouldn't recommend watching this. It's literally horrible.We just finished Lost (the series) which was TERRIFIC. One of the best shows we have ever seen. Then we tried this and Archive 81, and those were just plain boring and bad.We both don't recommend this series. Save your time and search for a better one (",2
"If you are watching this show only for the gore (like some of the low ratings here), it is not for you.Yes, there are very bloody moments and somewhat unbelievable zombie sequences, but that is a mere fraction of what this show is aiming towards. Under the ""zombies"" and ""fighting"", there is excellent emotional tension and moral exploration. From the students to the officials, the implications of moral judgement are monumental to the progression of the plot. Within the inhumanness, the interactions of such characters entrance us into a somewhat first-hand view of their relationships, where the threats from the ""zombies"" are often side-lined. This led to a truly well rounded series. This is matched with a great musical score, good direction (mostly) and excellent performances all around.There are a few things I didn't like. Firstly, there are many scenes where it feels alot like a soap opera. Characters freeze up way too often, and such moments are quite cliche.Secondly, the girls in this episode, (except one) are extremely sterotypical, and to an extent, useless. Most of them just stand around and whine, sometimes even when the group is being attacked. They after running two steps, they can't get up, they sulk and cry instead of fighting back. I would like to see more women step up and become emotionally and physically strengthened.In general, All of Us Are Dead is a thrilling show that often side-lines the blood and gore of a traditional zombie show for a emotionally charged and humane primary plot. It is at times stereotypical and cliché, but it is an excellent binge-watch. I had an excellent time watching it, its topping the Netflix charts, and I would certainly recommend it.",8
"Love these Korean zombies series fast paced great action what not to love about it . Why better than British zombie movies . I want more. Don't understand negative reviews , not to be taken to seriously delicious fun everything you want in zombie series ,prefer films myself but this one of the better series I have watched.",7
This show is pretty awesome and well done.If you dont like teenagers in school this isnt for you.If you love everything zombies then you'll enjoy the heck out of this.It has lots of great zombie attacks and isnt dull.I hope there is as many seasons as the walking dead or at least a few more.,10
"Was gonna give this a 9 but when the dad sacrificed himself for his daughter at the tennis court, I had had enough of the terrible writing of this show. There was no reason for that.",4
"I'd love to give this series an 8 or more. It had potential. Unfortunately, nearly every decision the characters make is beyond stupid. They all deserve to die. And multiple people should be fired... director, producers, writers.",4
"I don't get all the negative reviews. Entertaining zombie film with a touch of Korean comedy and Korean drama. Great acting from everyone. Don't read other reviews, watch and decide for yourself.",10
"My favourite zombie series is Kingdom and train to Busan is far better than most western made zombie movies. Also Squid Game was very good, however, that does not mean that everything from Korea will be awesome and that we should like it just because of that.All of us are dead is not good not bad, it has some interesting scenes, yet it feels that it should not have been 12 episodes... same issue that the walking dead had when people would rave about how ""deep"" the characters were, when in reality they did just have a lot of unnecessary dialogue and filler content that do not give the characters anything.I found myself skipping through by the end.Oh yes and one of the bullies is overdone on how many times he comes back.. it just annoyed me by that point.It is meh in one word.",5
"If you don't mind watching a bad drama talks between two who a horde of zombies are behind and they just need 5 seconds to escape and live but they wasted it on talking about romance while the zombies are waiting for them to finish.If you don't mind a horde of zombies biting someone from the back and when they turn, there's not a single bite spot or blood.If you don't mind watching everyone turn to zombie in 5 seconds except for the main cast they take an entire episode.If you don't mind a person who's seen 100+ zombie biting humans still ask a zombie who's biting someone ""hey stop it what are you doing"" then get scared when they get attacked.If you don't mind watching a total of 2 IQ divided by everyone including the zombies.Then, this show is too good to be true.. for you!",2
"On-jo: Push me to edge, All my Friends are Dead. Push me to edge, All my Friends are Dead. Push me to edge, All my Friends are Dead.Probably the most infuriating show of this year so far. When I looked through this show, I was surprised that there's 12 episodes with 1 hour average runtime per episode. How can you make such a long show about zombies, one of the most saturated horror genres?Just as my suspicion, the first 4 episodes were utter rubbish. It added nothing new, just the zombies pandemic breaking out. At this point I was thinking: let's rewatch Kingdom or Busan rather than this. The only thing kept me forward was the unique way of how the pandemic started.Then episode 5 started, and the show picked up quickly with a new twist. It was very intense, chaotic, and unexpectedly funny. The characters were all hormonal kids, so they are bound to make stupid decisions amid a zombie attack. The twist was pretty good, and I think that it did enough to justify the existence of this show.Character-wise, some were just straight-up wasteful. The two most notable were Na Yeon and On-Jo's dad. Some characters were incredibly infuriating like Nam-ra. The rest were pretty straightforward.One thing that I have to point out. This show referenced Train to Busan, and made it clear that zombies movies exist in this universe. I think that it's supposed to be funny, but this really made the character decisions baffling. One kid pointed out this fact, but no one else seemed to be aware of this fact. The zombies acted pretty much exactly like in Busan and Peninsula. Couple of characters at one point killed zombies by stabbing the neck or head, but at another point had no clue how to kill a zombie. Like why don't they learn? It's an urgent situation, but they can't be that stupid.Overall, this show is filled with problems, but it still added something new and made most of the runtime intense and fun. 6.5/10.",6
I just wanna say that This show is way better than other series .. I just loved it & can't for another season..we need season 2 as soon as possible ....,10
"One of the best zombie series from Korea after kingdom...!!!! A must see ..!!!Awesome action sequences, suspense , gore , the scenes cherographed was too good , and the story was great...!!!",10
"It was pretty decent alot of stuff though did make me mad like why is nobody, throwing anyone turning out the window? What was the whole point of that girl being pregnant, why did nobody do as they saw others do and stab each zombie in the face or neck. Why did the girl in pink just die and become a full zombie if she was bitten by the bully kid and same for the kid on white with the bowl cut and naamra whose a super zombie? They did all this running around but there was food and sodas in the closet and nobody touched on that just the candy bar and doing abunch of work to escape a room where they had food and water or sodas. Where was the brains to find a way into the room. Is Chaesun the one who liked Onjo actually dead? Too many plot holes while watching this.But this was a great zombie series and was executed right and had me wanting to watch more and more and i loved the thriller aspect of this and how many people actually died and only a few made it out.",8
"The actors and crew excelled in all respects, the shooting and directing are wonderful, but what made me rate 8/10 is that some scenes were not necessary and serve the story, and the other aspect is that the music or the music effects are very weak in this work, it could have been presented in a better way as for the rest It is incredibly perfect. I do not like to see works of the type of the living dead, but I say that this work has taken this type of business to another level, and it is considered that the Korean works are very impressive recently.",8
"Enjoyed the overall look, story, cinematography and actors. If you're a fan of zombie movies and series that might be right for you, but there are scenes, actions and parts of the series, which are completely pointless and lengthen the series itself to an unnecessary length.This series would have been fine with four to five episodes, but these twelve make it kind of boring and losing interest within its progress. Less is more.",5
"Boring stuff and lame stories don't get better if you produce them in South Korea! Mix some Teenage highscool crap stories with a virus and let them all get zombies. Zzz! The story is told a thousand times the last 10 years in roundabout a 100 zombie series. Why stupid humans need another one? I am really sick and tired of Netflix. They are so predictable. Show one series out of South Korea, see that it is successful, buy a thousand lame series more from South-Korea and hope they get hyped the same way. Nope thats not how it goes!",1
Masterpiece mind-blowing plz make season 2 best zombie series I dont have worlds to say mind blowing. Best zombie series in the world direction is awesome and acting is also great .,10
"For me, the most interesting part of this show is how and why the virus was created.What baffles me is the utter ignorance from on how to deal with these zombies. Even the person who is behind the origin of the zombie seems somehow baffled on what to do...I mean, I think it is safe to assume that the kids who go to this high school have seen at least 1 or 2 movies / series about zombies. Especially since some of the kids refer to 'Train to Busan'.Yet somehow they seem incapable to do what is necessary: smash their heads (and as such their brains) to kill them... or poke a pole through the zombie-brains. The chairs and desks have legs, right? At some point they actually have a broomstick in their hands and still the obvious move somehow escapes them.I have to admit that I have only seen two and a half episodes so maybe at some point things will turn around.Also, if you notice that someone gets bitten, don't just stand around... throw that person out of the window. Don't start a debate on what to do... YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO, IT'S THE ZOMBIE APOCALYPS!Sorry for my rant, I just can't see past this very annoying aspect of the series. Maybe it's just and me and I haven't seen enough Zombie-series/movies to make an honest judgement. But COME ON!!!Last but not least, I don't know if we are supposed to feel any sympathy with the characters, but until now there's just not enough background information to feel sympathy towards any of the characters. I like Bare-Su though, at least he kicks some Zombie asses! (but also fails to see the obvious 'scramble their brains' soluytion).",4
"Yes, some holes are there in plot but but.They are very very minimal.All the show was done with very good highdrama and action and complete realistic zombie series ever made in entire cinema world.Friendship, Honesty,Love, Survival, right to live was portrayed very well.10/10 rating was very less
i will give 1000/10 .The efforts they had made to make this series is very greatest.",10
I am binge watching this for the second time in a week. Action and drama in a very good balance. Top performances by all young actors. Many interesting sub-plots that are somehow overshadowed by the main story arc: the survival of a bunch of classmates. The concept of how the virus started is brilliant and very relevant to a 2022 take on the zombie genre. The Battle Royale loyals are going to love this.,8
Well made series....it is best zombies film/webseries till date...full of emotion ride and characters love...all characters are extraordinary...I mention one actor (who played Chong San) his acting was brillent . I am fan this chracter...but all cast are preety good....story are so fabulous ( zombies in school) ????,10
"After watching only 4 episode don't think it's a common zombie film. It have action , romance, thriller and what not. Eagerly waiting for season 2. If season 2 doesn't release it will be a disappointing thing but this is sooo good that season 2 will be soon available.",10
"The show doesn't pretend to be intellectual or sophisticated. It is straight up what a good classic zombie drama should be- packed with heart-thumbing action throughout, characters that one can relate to and despite being helm by a primarily a young cast of high school students, everyone delivered their roles really well, and some really emotional & heartbreaking moments towards the end.",10
"Please someone make a zombie show where the characters aren't complete idiots that stare blankly at people getting attached, that don't run like new born baby giraffes and make stupid speeches. This is not a good show, they're all wimps, they take risks for stupid things, they fall on the ground and just lay there for someone to pick them up. Just fight and stop pushing zombies away and why is it taking so long for the dad to get to the school?",4
"3 episodes in and I'm waiting to give a crap about any of these characters. None of them are likeable, or particularly smart or clever. The perfect show to watch while on your phone.",4
"Zombie fans, All of Us are Dead does not disappoint.These aren't your slow moving dumb zombies. These are your 28 days later, World War Z infected with advanced rabies type of zombies. High adrenaline, fast moving and terrifying, this show still manages to spend time developing characters and plot.I appreciate the amount of time they take for the zombie infection to spread, addressing issues of democracy while attempting to contain it.Most zombie shows have the infection spread early on and fast, then we're smack dab in the zombie apocalypse.AUAD gives us the perspective of what's happening inside the zone vs outside the zone, with media influence and political strategy.At the same time, this show doesn't take itself too seriously. There are some funny moments, like hearted comedy, and lovable characters along with some villains. It even pokes fun of it's early on, bring up Train to Busan, as they try to figure out what's happening.I'm half way through this first season and I'd say it's a well written show, especially for zombies.",8
"The first 3 episodes are really promising that I can't wait for more. Then the series goes downhill to the last episode. It became so cliche and lame. For instances; Nam Ra could have just screams run to them once she smelled zombies instead of detecting how many zombies were coming. Also, instead of running on the road, why wouldn't they just hide in an empty house? Moreover, they decided to fight the zombies with sticks and hammer? Okay Thor. And the mom is the dumbest by entering a field full with infected and called the obviously infected and get eaten. She deserved it. The father of the female lead went through a lot to find her daughter just to have a less than a minute scene with her. Also, there are too many self reflecting scenes among them. Honestly, we don't care. Last but not least, the director could've just utilized the halfbies (The bully and Nam Ra) characters more. It'd be a great ending if they both fighting for their own interest either for good and bad. Or maybe they could control all the zombies and use their ability to end the pandemic. The directors probably save the characters for the next series I hoped.",3
"Just binged the and to be honest ,I loved it. A little slow in places with the guilty party being the romance side of things as mayhem and carnage was being carried out just a doors width apart,but I guess to inject sum humanity into the series these parts were justified. Overall it's what it says on the tin,well acted ,filmed well,the mass zombie assaults were extremely well done,all the extras were obviously having a ball.Great series ,I'd highly recommend this.",9
"In the recent years Korean producers have been making good movies in the zombie sub-genre. Train to Busan, Netflix's Kingdom series etc and now: All of Us Are Dead. There are 2 points that I wanna raise here.First things first, the zombie-actors are simply marvellous! Look at those kids!!! I think some are really recruited from kindergartens and they have excellent performances comparable to many adult actors/actresses. Pound for pound these kids can overshadow kids in Walking Dead series. No bias, but Koreans are catching up.And secondly, it's the new concept. Precisely it's not exactly new or original, but it's rare in zom subgenre. Namely the ""asymptomatic"" zom. We've seen werewolves or vams or Hulk that can change form deliberately or casually or emotionally. But not always seen in zombies, yeah? I like this concept. Cool babe. It's makes the story much more intriguing. U never know the one sitting next to u is a norm or a zom.What's not that good then? Well, the mad science teacher. Yeah I know he has a very special background but, hey, look at him. He's not convincing at all. I don't mean he's a bad actor, but he's not that ""crazy scientist"" in all aspects. When I come to my senses I don't even believe he has sufficient resources to make any significant accomplishment in cellular biology projects. No no no, not even an compelling argument.As a conclusion, I love this series very much. Guys pls give it a shot. If u r a zom fan like me, ask your gal/guy to sleep first and then binge-watch it overnight. Worth your every minute ;)",8
Overrated to be honest. The best zombie kdrama is still the original KINGDOM! Nothing new to see here ... for 2022 there is other drama that is worth to watch than this. Definitely a No and will not waste my time watching this.,1
"This show is so overhyped, everything is poorly written from the characters to the plot. Compared to other amazing Asian shows such as Squid Game, Kingdom, Alice in the Borderland, etc, it's just so lackluster and stupid. A lot of things that happened in the show were so random like the pregnancy of that one student. So much potential wasted also, I was expecting the bullied Hambie to duel the Bully Hambie, and it was just so funny how Na-yeon got killed instantly, her character was so useless those few episodes she might as well have died with the teacher. It's cliche and super corny, the characters almost have no chemistry with each other, and the romance feels super forced. Main character is meh. Oh well, better not raise my expectations next time.",5
"Enough said.I wanted to stop at ""said"" cause that sums it up but stupid imdb wont let me...oh well...here we go...Seen every horror flick there is out there...not zombies though...they move slower than my grandma .. I mean...wheres the fun there...However,I m in 6 episodes and loving this. Be patient at first..it really builds up...and worth watching due to all other social issues it raises (bullying)Maybe I m wayyy too old(46)but really this is what bullying is like nowadays? I dont wanna send my son to school after watching this...and not because of the zombies...Enough said...give it a try.",8
"What a thrilling ride!! Literally keeps you on edge of your seat!!! Don't go with nagative reviews. I don't know what they expect from zombie movies/series!Really liked character development throughout the episodes. Plot is amazing! Enjoyed those comic parts, and thank god they mept these comic scenes becase at some points everything gets so intense that my breathing just stopped, but thanks to those funny scenes that gave some relaxation!",9
"Best series of 2022. All of the characters is very Amazing, Specialy Class President ??????, Love form Pakistan to my South Korean Brothers, keep it up, & I m Now Still Waiting for the Season 2.",10
Let the bullies be the heroes. Let everyones reactions be strange. Let's not establish any character development. Well that pretty much sums this series up.,1
"If you are in a zombie-infested school, survival should be your top priority but not these kids. It would be understandable if the premise of the story is that they are unaware that zombies exist but these kids have sited a famous zombie Korean movie in their script so that would not be the case. After that line, all of the scene just don't make sense anymore. I mean only four people thought of protecting their bodies when going out? Even their concerns and problems are not pertaining to survival but on foolish dilemmas like going to the bathroom hygienically and ending up in a worse possible solution? Hoping it would make things lighter and funny. But honestly It just grossing me out! Who wrote that!? Thinking about food and water supplies for these kids could have been better right? Even the government's concern and decision in this series just don't make sense. Like really?? Maybe the writers can learn from ""Lost in Space"" or ""#Alive"".",1
"This show is amazing. They bring a fresh take on the zombie genre with notes on innocent love, true friendships, and hardships that are honestly heartbreaking at times. It's well rounded and disappointing at times but it's so incredibly worth watching. I rated the show a 9/10 because I am so disappointed at who loses their lives. There's so many characters you fall in love with only to lose them. There could have been at least one off limits!",9
"That's right. If you're a teenager or have a teenager IQ for movies. This ones for you and most movies out there.Disappointing but didn't expect too much. Dialogue is simple. Yes the culture is diff than America or Europe but story is relatable. Some really terrible emotional scenes for characters that are almost adults. It's really a waste of time after the 3rd episode. I wasted my time cuz I was in a snowpocalypse for 2 days. It's a very frustrating to watch, characters are dull, slow at times and plenty of rip off zombie scenes.",3
"This is a good show but it had me frustrated a couple of times. I think it has a lot of cool action and chase scenes. Su-Hyeon pulling off some martial arts moves never gets old, neither Cheong-san running through dozens of zombies. The setting is very cool. The acting, the characters being high school students and acting like one were some other strong points about it. But I couldn't help but get disappointed near the last 3 episodes.Well unlike another Korean zombie flick, Train to Busan (which isn't a perfect movie either), most characters do not really develop themselves. Apart from the class president making friends with others and being a nicer person (thanks to On-jo and Su-Hyeong) I didn't notice any major changes. Again, there was a lot of tear-jerking moments as it is in Train to Busan, but they take too much screen time. On top of that, some of these sad scenes are focused on very insignificant/less known about characters which makes it a hundred times more boring to watch through. Nevertheless it is a decent show and I can't bring myself to not like it. Seven out of ten, could have been much better without the drawn out tear-jerking.",7
"I have seen enough of this, from Train to Busan, Kingdom, and now this. Same scenery where there is Zombie rampage, massive zombies chasing
Human by running away for their lives...after the second episode, I stopped watching it.",3
"I really enjoyed this, and whilst it was obviously about a Zombie outbreak it felt much, much more, with characters I actually cared about.Some comments have said it's just the same as all other S Korean zombie films. Perhaps. But the physicality and action within the school were still ten times better than some of the stuff churned out in the US or Europe.It didn't shirk away from violence and wasn't afraid to kill off key characters - although you could argue it was a bit too keen at times. Maybe some of the side stories didn't really go anywhere, but they at least broke up the main focus so it didn't become too claustrophobic in one location, and even then you felt the whole of the school was utilised to give it a sense of scale.Things I liked:Good charactersGood set pieces and effectsGenuine interest in where the story was goingMain quibbles:The origin story of the virus was a bit ridiculousIs it realistic that the infected would just stay within that specific area and it wouldn't spread further?Apart from the school why are there never zombie children in the streets? (Something in all films to be fair)Probably could have been trimmed down to 10 episodes max.Overall, I thought this was just as good as Squid Game and, in some instances, better.",8
"It starts of great. Its entertaining and I like how its pragmatic about the survival of a zombie apocalypse. The characters start a bit flat, but then develops, which is pretty cool. But now I am at episode 8 and more than 8 hours of watching the show, I am TIRED of countless unnecessary cliffhangers and extention of details in many of the scenes. We don't have to spend 10 minutes watching every main character talking into a camera greeting their parents and so on.And in my opinion, some details of the plot is just stupid, and it's very clear that it has been made this way to make it possible to extend the season to the max. This story could have been told in 10 episodes and i feel like im wasting my time.If you decide to begin watching this show, be prepared to be annoyed.",4
"I'm halfway through episode 2 and over it. I enjoy a good zombie movie, but I'm tired of watching the same boring tropes. I was really hoping this could be different, but alas, it's all the same. Good production value can't overcome horrible scriptwriting, plot holes, and annoying characters. I'm sure this is a teenager's wet dream, but I can already feel my brain cells screaming in agony.What's with the bone cracking?? The inconsistent turn rates? There are students running around outside, yet no one thinks to run out of the school gates? We watch one short scene with the principal and that's it... wtf happened to the staff? Does this school not own an office with phones? Don't the classrooms have phones?? Where are the police? In the ""real world,"" rational people are fighting to survive- not mooning over their crush, calling each other ""c*$ksucker"" (that gem came from a teacher to a student), or standing around wondering HOW to kill these things when ""Train to Busan"" is clearly referenced several times.I literally cannot fathom sitting through 10 more hours of this, especially if the origin story is of Dad of the Year injecting his bullied son with a homemade recipe for revenge. What a disappointment- for once I'd love to see a total overhaul of the genre. I'm reminded of how I felt seeing the Matrix back in 99... it was new and exciting. I havent watched ""Train to Busan"" yet, but hope that it will restore some faith in zombies again.",3
Neeeeeeeddddd kooooo ng season 2 at BUHAYIN SI CHEONG SAN plsssa sana mag ka season 2 para mabuhay si cheong san KASE SABE NI NAM_RA THERE BACK SO ITS MEANS NA BAKA SI CHEONG SAN YON AT MAY KASAMA PA SYANG IBA.,10
"The series wasn't toooo bad but it could've been done in eight parts instead of twelve. At the midpoint it started dragging on way too much first with the group assembling in the choir room lamenting and arguing, then the roof for two episodes, lamenting and arguing, then we got a little action as they moved from the roof to the closet in the gym, and we had to spend time with them crying, lamenting and arguing some more for an episode and a half. Looord snooze fest. As diverse and fleshed out as the main characters were they weren't all that likable or interesting. I loved when they shared a candy bar in the closet as if they hadn't eaten in weeks when only 24 hours had gone by since the infection started.Then the one antagonist kept getting pushed out windows and pushed off the roof and then he kept coming back so that plot point got a little stale. I think if I had zombie superpowers the last thing I would care about is my missing eye and getting revenge for it. After all, his body was crunched, twisted, bit, smashed, mashed... he looked like hell so why was he worried about his eye for?I think this would've been a lot better if they had only trimmed the melodramatic repetitive fat and kept it to six episodes.Anywho...",6
This series show us all emotions of love hate jealousy and still focus on its main plot zombies .... 12 ep 1 hour of each I binge watched it finsh it in single go for 12 hour continous ... the character of each of mai cast connectsand other thing is that the story from the scratch give you different feel .I am eagerly waiting for season 2.,10
"I was looking forward to it because it was the original webtoon, but I could feel the zombie costume and the actors' zombie acting was full of tension and fun. I often saw that part because it seems like it was directed by replacing too sensational content such as rape and peeling with school violence. I think the camera's feeling and filter at that time became more immersive!!",10
"Talking about the positives the series has good characters, story, suspence and a new type of zombies that can be called as half zombies. The show is suspenseful from beginning to the end and won't really bore you cause there are many interesting events that happen in each episode that makes you wanna watch the next episode. However the show is quite repetitive in terms of the zombie encounters and the way they deal with the zombies sometimes is both senseless and impractical. Also the show uses quite a few ""fake"" Encounters and incidents to lure the audience to the next episode. The climax of the show is good but it leaves a lot of questions that needs to be answered but at the same time it seems unnecessary to make another season just to answer those questions cause those questions aren't that interesting to make people wanna watch another season. Overall it's a good way to pass your free time.",7
"Some pf the places in the scnerio there was problems but its still a very good Zombie scnerio. First of all they dont know how to seperate human/zombie mix.. but it is easy. They are very sensitive with sound, they dont eat normal food, they heal in couple of hours.Some of the bite scenes easily can stop but others were just waithing around. Korean's did again very good job. I love the show. I finished all the episodes in one breath. Reactions were very real, their human needs were very real. Very nice details. Perfect.",10
"Well I wanted to watch this drama because people seem to be really like this. It was okay for first episodes but...WHAT IS THAT? Theare very absurdly designed. I was happy when I saw some of the zombies are different from eachother. But what's the point if you don't use it perfectly? The group has a girl zombie/human on their side but they don't use it for their good. For example, they saw the ""bully"" zombie/human can go anywhere and zombies don't make something to him. Then, THEN WHY THE MEMBER OF GROUP SACRIFACE THEMSELVES INSTEAD OF GIRL ZOMBIE/HUMAN? Just tell her ""go away and make noise while we escape.""
And why the girl in the pink dress survive first in that room and eat/drink what her want, and we saw that she wanted to help and then she died soon after. Why didn't you kill her when she went away with teacher?I can't understand. My English is dead. Lol.",3
Relation between Korean Series & Zombies are always great.. Love to watch this show. I've completed almost 50% of episodes. And this is very awesome ?? I like it... Koreans really know how to make movies & series with a lot of emotions... Want more content like this ??,10
"If you're a fan of zombie genre then you would find it to be better than most of the existing Zombie based TV series/movies but the concept is predictable. There are few loopholes that are visible to the naked eye but still the production value makes up to it. Some of the characters are too shallow and they could've trimmed it to 10 episodes as 12 episodes felt a bit lengthy. Other than that, it's worth a watch.",7
I can't begin to praise this superbly entertaining zombie thriller enough. The direction is superb clear even though lots is going on. Some of the scenes are truly memorable and epic. There is such a variety of scenarios and action sequences that it is exciting throughout. The stunt work is seamless so that it looks like the actors are doing them. Some epic scenes feel like a big budget movie.The show doesn't fall short in the more intimate quiet scenes either. Characters both heroes and villains are involving and sympathetic and the relationships are interesting enough. The emotional scenes are good too - not overwrought but moving enough when a character you like gets bitten.Cast members do a good job. The older cast has some familiar faces especially if you have seen the excellent but different pandemic show Happiness. The young cast isn't very famous and that's good since you don't associate them with other roles that much.The 12 episodes just sped by. Of the recent worldwide topping Netflix shows I enjoyed this more than Hellbound and Squid Game.,10
"Over all I believe it's a well done series.One thing I did notice that was completely wrong was the students debating the meaning of the distress signal S-O-S. They are debating this in the episode where they're on the school roof top. The female student who's father was an EMT says that SOS doesn't mean anything, that it's not an acronym. It does in fact stand for SAVE OUR SHIP.Not sure the writers can get more than one series out of this. Just my opinion.",7

"I saw the trailer and was like ""It'll be ok"" cos I like the zombie genre and I think Train To Busan is the greatest zombie movie of all time. So I was looking forward to this show but with a very average expectation. So I watched the firsts episode and instantly got hooked. The introduced the characters well, friction between all of them was further developed even better as the show progresses. It is fun, thrilling and an entertaining show that had me binging deep into the night. 12 episode and I thought none felts boring. It is a very good show and worth it very much.",8
Who greenlit this to be a 12 episode series? It's so dragged. No story just talking talking and more talking for 12+ hrs. It should have been just 6 or 8 episodes. Wasted potential.,6
"This is actually my favourite zombie show after ftwd. Even the title is interesting, that's what brought me to the show and how I started watching it and with that I made othe best decision ever. I was a little sceptical at first but the first episode was when I realised how good and amazing it is. I literally love it so much, it's one of my comfort shows. I cannot even put it to words how much I love that show. I mean the characters are cool asf, the story, plot, how authentic and real it look cus it has a high budget. It's literally too good to be true. I'm really looking forward to a season 2. I really recommend this to anyone who loves apocalyptic movies/shows, k-dramas, zombies and much much more. I literally feel so sad after watching it all and I want more of the show. It's that really lame feeling when you finish your favourite show and just don't know what to do. No spoilers here but it truly amazed me and just everything about it is spectacular. There's literally nothing bad about it. And it was such an enjoyment, I really enjoyed every second of the series and it's easily my favourite show at the moment. A solid 10/10 with no doubts. Recommend it 101%!! Watch it you won't regret it!!",10
"I really don't understand how anyone can rate this above a 5. It's awful: unrealistic script, bad acting, amateur directing. The zombies are pathetic with their contortions and clicking sound effects. Another reviewer said it should be called We are all stupid. Most poignant comment ever on this embarrassing series. The rotten tomatoes rating doesn't reflect the critics reviews. Don't waste your time.",3
"Pretty standard overly dramatic k zombie, the way the characters written are pretty dumb, but then again they are high school students so i guess they were supposed to be dumb? The ever so often comedic bits are pretty much what gets me through watching the while thing. In conclusion, scientist oppar is hot af.",6
"Very good Filmography, No unique topic though but let me tell u dat d writer is merciless,He srsly kills any body lmao ,but good story line not boring Like it.....",8
I've never seen before like this series. It's amazing show. I really love this series. The friendship the bonding the teamwork and the visual effects and acting. It's really appreciated.,10
"I love the series but my annoyance kept piling up because I thought it was a Korea movie that I shouldn't raise my expectations. Not until I saw squid game, with it episodes less than 10. They tried to make it as real as possible and it became a huge success...Why will a Commander commit suicide because he ordered the execution of a small town so as to contain the virus. Thus saving million.. In US such scenerio are called COLLATERAL DAMAGE.No one would persecute him for that!!!I love the K-drama because they are growing so fast and rapid but 90% of their series makes me so mad at the end. I had to stop watching Lee Min Ho because his movies are too childish and his acting too.. not talking about the good looks.I had to recommend this series to a lot of my colleagues after watching the first 6 episodes... And you guys kept disappointing me thereafter.Especially the zombie bully running around the school, he should have been eliminated.. and some scenes are just too dumb.Like Nam ra father sacrificing himself... Come on, I'm a fictional writer.. some sacrifice are just too stupid likewise Na Yeon mom, that's the most disappointing moment ever.Tz_Chilest.",6
"I liked this show. It was a good experience watching this and I was screaming when the zombies suddenly came. The most appreciated thing about this series was the makeup, the location and all the things that make zombies look real.",7
"A nearly perfect zombie series... definitely worth watching...
The rating should be above 8 star
Underrated...
Again proved that korean dramas makers are ???? creativity, story, visuals, technicalities, choreography..",8
"During the 12 episodes with a total running time of over 12 hours, the heart rate displayed on the Apple Watch never dropped below 100.The level of immersion is high enough to maintain tension for a long time, and the various zombies that unfold throughout the play made the drama more interesting.I think the zombie acting was more realistic because the actors learned and practiced the zombie choreography from the choreographer for the zombie acting.I'm really looking forward to season 2.",10
"It's not even good, yet people rate higher than 1 star. Slow pacing, lots if unecessary dialogue, conflicts were forced, and mutations were so random. I love zombie movies, but this is just meh. Wasted my time. Skipped through every single episode just to get to the ""good"" parts.",1
"After squid game, Korea did they it again! Don't watch the trailer, it will spoil so much. This one is highly recommended, it's wild, entertaining and engaging. There is no nudity,sex and this show feels so real. It's super awesome starting from the 3rd episode. Also a cliffhanger at the end of every episode. Ending is satisfactory. Hoping for the 2nd season.",8
"It made me feel that it was something really fresh from the genre.Before delving into why I thought it was good, let's stop for a second to remove the basic prejudice about zombie movies.A lot of people are saying it's yet the old zombie trope and same old thing again. ""Characters trying to survive and dying one by one."" But I don't think it is fair to compare or judge it that way.It's like saying oh this action movie is about characters fighting, then other action movies including characters fighting cannot be good. Or this drama is about a character's life story then other dramas about other characters lives' story is not innovative because both are telling life stories about a character.I am a huge zombie fan, and have watch most of the zombie shows/movies.Obviously the premise is the normal zombie premise but what made the show differentiate from the rest, is the other elements added into it such as character depths, morals, love, hope, hate and friendship. There are characters that will make you laugh, cheer for, like, hate and also get annoyed at. Which in itself is a success because it made you feel that way.It also had twist and turns that are not used in many other zombie flicks. And I have to say as an avid zombie veteran, I was taken by surprise more than a handful of scenes. (Which is not easy at all since I have seen most of them.) And if it managed to make you immediately want to click on the next episode to see what happens next, it has also succeeded.Yes, it got it's bad moments sometimes, can be slow, stupid decisions are made and also a few plot holes. But those are forgiven in the grander scheme of things. The cinematography was beautiful, zombies really well made, acting was amazing by such young actors and action sequences realistically done. And again, in this ""overdone"" genre it managed to be fresh from the rest and made me think about it after the credits were rolling. For a zombie series, it deserved a 10 for me.",10
"RIGHT NOW I CAN'T CONTROL MY EMOTIONS ....No words for this series..
..only one word masterpiece...
Especially i like the best scene is conversation between those friends in school roof top??????BTW too much violence.",10
Sound and act and speed of zombie like clickers in Last of us game! No Creativity.story poor and thin. Hourly creation decisions.for example why Le Cheongson's mother in spite of know exactly deadly zombies go to school with no plan.part of cafeteria in high school more funny Instead horrible.human and zombies slip like Charlie Chaplin in his moveies! I think 6 is enough for this show.,6
"Korean Industry has set high expectations about Zombie movies and dramas. So,if I compare this with these than this is nothing infront of those masterpieces. It is an avarage Zombie drama about how the school students survives from Zombie Apocalypse. I find the reflection of ''High School of dead '' anime somehow. It is because both occurred at school and they kind of have similarities too. However,I enjoyed it without thinking more. For me maybe, 5/6 episodes would be enough. It seemed to be dragged a lot. As there were no survival techniques were shown, all are about running or climbing the floors again and again. There weren't much character development and plenty of plot holes. Most funny thing is some zombies don't even die after killing multiple times. What they are trying to convey? They are immortal??The ending is awful. I don't think there is any season needed, it was already dragged too much but they ended it this way.",5
"All of us Are Dead: This is a zombie Survival thriller web series. How this virus spreads from one school to the whole city and everyone is trying to save their lives, is shown in the series. The series gets interesting from the first episode itself. Direction is good but editing could have been better. Every episode is for one hour, so it gets boring at times. The work by all the actors was fantastic and the zombies looked great too. Although the concept was not new, it was heartening to see the way it was presented to us. You can definitely watch it once.",7
"The first episodes of this series are wonderful, turning the Hollywood cliché of ill-mannered teens fighting zombies into an almost cartoonish depiction of zombie invasions. Fun. The action is well filmed, the acting adequate and the pacing for the first seven episodes tight and disciplined.Of course, the show is not without major faults, the biggest being characters just standing there as zombies attack, reacting only at the last second. I laughed every time because it plays into the MacGruber joke and does it too many times.Too bad ep 8 is so boring, The series tries to get back on track but loses its way with too much repetition (a sense of deju vu abounds throughout as the series progresses).",7
"I enjoyed but i found the story was streched unnecessarily,the same sort of thing kept happening and happening and this could be ended by epi 11,but again streched unnecessarily for the 2nd season.",7
"Please do watch this series in little dim light and both headphones sounds little hight. It is very amazing. All episode are ending in such a suspence that u have to watch the next episode at that right time right there ...... Eagerly waiting for season 2

Please do watch.",10
"This series is really great, in my opinion, this series has performed great in all the effects and scenes, even in the last two episodes, the sad scenes were made very naturally, which also attracted the viewer to the sad atmosphere of the series. The series was great in every way and made me love Korean cinema more.",10
"I think the best show i have ever saw in zombies, after the movie Train to busaan this was an epic storyline and the cast were nice.And the best part of this series was that there were two types of zombies (partially we can say that), one is good zombies like Nam-ra as and the other ones are bad zombies.And currently i am waiting for the next season to came.As per my opinion you should go for it to watch this show.",10
"What a rollercoaster! If you like any suspenseful (zombie) movies/series (Train to Busan, Kingdom, Sweet Home) with a touch of romance. This is a must watch!Cheong-San & Nim-ra are the ones stealing the show. Cheong-San devotion to his friends & family made his character really likable. You really feel for him. My favorite scene was the library scene of Cheong-San. He really has the toughest action scenes of the whole cast. I hope he is one of the halbies in an upcoming season. For Nim-ra she slowly grown into me from a not so interesting character to one of the main focus of the story.Mostly I have difficulties with the Korean names. I tend to mix them up, but luckily the names here chosen are easier to recognize and to remember.Only thing I missed and I really was anticipating for was a show down between the bullied girl Eung-ji and the bully Gwi-nam. This was a miss since Eung-ji has now all the strength to fight back.Looking forward to season 2!",10
"Thrilling and entertaining series. Great acting by each one of the characters, infact few characters are brilliant. Nice story line, A must watch one????",10
"In the beginning, good zombie action and students working together, but then around episode 4 just got really boring, by episode 9 I was just saying ""come on, rap this up""",3
"Its a good zombie show, was slow at parts but i overall enjoyed the show. Best thing about korean dramas on netflix is i don't have to watch force diversity or identity politics that are plaguing the U. S t.v shows.",8
"Absolutely gripping and thrilling from the start. Fingernail biting scenes and total thrill and tension.An amazing show! Totally love it!Harsh, brutal and gory at times, exactly what you would expect.That's how a zombie series/movie is made. Zac Snyder could watch and learn.Pure awesomeness!If you like the zombie topic, this is for you.Two thumbs up!!",10
"Review By Kamal KSeason 1 - 6/10""All of us are dead"" is a classic zombie drama with a lot of action, thriller and horror elements. Even though the story is nothing groundbreaking, it doesn't fail to deliver enjoyment to the viewers that seek for zombies and epic action.My overall impression of the drama's story is not very great, not very bad either. It was a mediocre story and there were many unnecessary and illogical things for me to accept. Also, several same (or almost same) things and events happened which made the story repetitive and tedious at times. What I liked the most, was how it manages to show how differently everyone acts in order to survive or to save someone else.Postive -EntertainmentEmotionsNegative -Plot HolesIllogical Things.",6
"Such great action and suspense! I absolutely loved how nail biting, exciting and fast paced the show was. I wrote that this show is so stressful that it distracts you from a lot of the character writing issues. I had previously written how the teenagers and adults alike frequently made such selfish choices that it felt unbelievable. I frequently was yelling at the screen wondering why would you do that in a literal life or death zombie apocalypse situation??? Like their choices just didn't seem realistic for this high stake scenario. But then I learned more about the sewol ferry accident and the depressing truth is that the choices of the adults accurately reflect reality. May those left behind Rest In Peace and I commend the show for touching on such a series topic.",8
"I am wating for season 2.There are few on-screen situations more dread-inducing than watching a zombie outbreak in real time. Tracking a single infection as it grows exponentially and tears through an unwitting populace is an anxiety-riddled experience that's rarely easy to watch. ""All of Us are Dead,"" the latest Netflix drama to take a stab at a widespread cataclysmic event, announces itself in its opening episode by meticulously showing the transformation of a school. In a single afternoon, the massive Hyosan High School complex is plunged into chaos after one errant bite from a science lab test animal starts an irreversible chain reaction.",10

When it reaches a good spot, it freezes in place. A stalk slowly grows from its head. The stalk then spews out spores that spread, turning others into zombies.This is no Halloween story about the zombie apocalypse. It's all true. The zombie isn't a human, though. It's an ant. And the stalk that emerges from its head is a fungus. Its spores infect other ants, which lets the zombie cycle begin anew.In order to grow and spread, this fungus must hijack an ant's brain. However weird this might seem, it isn't all that unusual. The natural world is full of zombies under mind control. Zombie spiders and cockroaches babysit developing wasp larvae - until the babies devour them. Zombie fish flip around and dart toward the surface of the water, seeming to beg for birds to eat them. Zombie crickets, beetles and praying mantises drown themselves in water. Zombie rats are drawn to the smell of the pee of cats that may devour them.All of these ""zombies"" have one thing in common: parasites. A parasite lives inside or on another creature, known as its host. A parasite may be a fungus, a worm or another tiny creature. All parasites eventually weaken or sicken their hosts. Sometimes, the parasite kills or even eats its host. But death of the host isn't the freakiest goal. A parasite might get its host to die in a certain place, or be eaten by a certain creature. In order to accomplish these tricks, some parasites have evolved the ability to hack into the host's brain and influence its behavior in very specific ways.How do parasites turn insects and other animals into the walking almost-dead? Every parasite has its own method, but the process usually involves altering chemicals within the victim's brain. Researchers are working hard to identify which chemicals are involved and how they end up so bizarrely altering their host's behavior.Brains, brains! Ant brains!A fungus doesn't have a brain. And worms and single-celled critters obviously aren't very smart. Yet somehow they still control the brains of larger, and smarter, animals.""It blows my mind,"" says Kelly Weinersmith. She is a biologist who studies parasites at Rice University in Houston, Texas. She is particularly interested in ""zombie"" creatures. True zombies, she points out, aren't exactly like the type you find in horror stories. ""In no way are these animals coming back from the dead,"" she says. Most real zombies are doomed to die - and some have very little control over their actions.The horsehair worm, for instance, needs to emerge in water. To make this happen, it forces its insect host to leap into a lake or swimming pool. Often, the host drowns.Toxoplasma gondii (TOX-oh-PLAZ-ma GON-dee-eye) is a single-celled creature that can only complete its life cycle inside a cat. But first, this parasite must live for a time in a different animal, such as a rat. To ensure this part-time host gets eaten by a cat, the parasite turns rats into cat-loving zombies.In Thailand, a species of fungus - Ophiocordyceps - can force an ant to climb almost exactly 20 centimeters (about 8 inches) up a plant, to face north and then to bite down on a leaf. And it makes the ant do this when the sun is at its highest point in the sky. This provides ideal conditions for the fungus to grow and release its spores.Biologist Charissa de Bekker wants to better understand how that fungus exerts that mind control over the ants. So she and her team have been studying a species related to the Ophiocordyceps fungus in Thailand. This U. S. cousin is a fungus native to South Carolina. It, too, forces ants to leave their colonies and climb. These ants, though, bite down on twigs instead of leaves. This is likely due to the fact that trees and plants in this state lose their leaves in the winter.De Bekker began these studies at Pennsylvania State University in University Park. There, her team infected a few species of ant with the South Carolina fungus. The parasite could kill all of the different ants she introduced to it. But the fungus made plant-climbing zombies only out of the species that it naturally infects in the wild.To figure out what was going on, de Bekker's team collected new, uninfected ants of each species. Then, the researchers removed the insects' brains. ""You use forceps and a microscope,"" she says. ""It's sort of like that game Operation.""The researchers kept the ant brains alive in small Petri dishes. When the fungus was exposed to its favorite brains (that is, ones from the ants that it naturally infects in the wild), it released thousands of chemicals. Many of these chemicals were completely new to science. The fungus also released chemicals when exposed to unfamiliar brains. These chemicals, however, were completely different. The researchers published their results in 2014.The experiments at Penn State by de Bekker's team were the first to create ant zombies in the lab. And the researchers only succeeded after setting up artificial 24-hour cycles of light and darkness for the zombies and their parasites.It will take more work to learn how the parasite's chemicals lead to zombie behavior in ants. ""We are very much in the beginning of trying to figure this out,"" says de Bekker. She now studies ant zombies at Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich, Germany. There, she is now probing how that daily cycle of sunlight and darkness affects zombification.",5
"As a student, I love how the movie tries to portray real-time scenarios during a zombie apocalypse. I also appreciate the cast's efforts in making this tv series. I hope that there is a Season 2.",10
"I think it's a well-made zombie movie. Since South Korea is a country where civilians are illegal to have guns, there is no such coolness to shoot and kill like ordinary zombie movies, but I think the tension from the situation where there is no specific way to respond was the best.",10
One of the my best series love angle was superb i love it waiting for second season very good story line. First time I tried Korean series it was more than expectations and character of this series were very natural .,10
"Nothing can beat this , it contains all things you want , chrachters are too good its awesome. In most series only some episodes are interesting but in "" all of us are dead "" all the episode are so interesting you can't stop watching.",10
"The series is really disappointing. It's cliche with borderline cringy lines. It has inferior characters, with plenty of unnecessary scenes. It's such a let down, considering Korean dramas are great with the zombie genre. It has cheap jokes, no good plotline, and overdramatic scenarios.",1
"I love everything zombie. Everything. But the majority of characters in this are so damn stupid, unlikeable, selfish or just plain evil. I spent the whole series wishing they'd get eaten or turned because of how terrible most of the characters are. There was a couple of good ones. But the students you're meant to root for are just kind of awful and annoying.Great effects and some great acting, but the characters are so... blah. I suppose that's the point though. Humans don't really deserve to survive since they suck so much. True in a way.",3
"I'm so glad that i got to watch such an amazing zombie series. The best part is that they didn't left any loose ends and explained the reason and cause everything very smoothly. And the scenes were too reall i binged watched it and it felt like I'm with those school students .Plus they highlighted the fact of bullying and reality of society, first squid game, then hellbound and then All of us are dead. I'm looking forward to it's season 2.",10
It's another wild ride from the Koreans definitely worth watching. Will keep you entertained for a weekend. There are some annoying things about characters I wish they could fix then they really would be superb. The lack of emotions and chemistry between the actors. They are great actors but we need to see a range of different emotions and expressions conveyed. For example you rarely see smiles just dead pan expressions.,8
"The zombies are active, very agile and can run fast, which is very important because it will make the audience tense to watch it, even though the content of the story is not as good as the first train to busan, but this is better than the walking dead with weak zombies, hopefully another story will emerge zombies from south korea.",10
"Although I am almost 50 I really enjoyed this series. The Korean have proven they ate great story tellers and can do it with smaller budget. But what I really liked is the healthy
ethical and sensible message. And of course it's a bit over the top but to make a point you have to be more clear. The story uses the zombies to get the point across but it could have easily a war situation it's the same thing. How in desperate times you need to come toghether. How vanities and personal loss take an other place in your ego. How friendship is michorw fragile than a social media post. How it feels if you let thing be unset. How everybody deals with stuff differently.",8
"This is gonna be one of the best show I've watched this year. The production, directing, characters, performances & everything else is truly superb. I have not binged watch many shows (except Daredevil & Squid Game) because they just don't hook me into them but i was hooked to my screen from the first 5 minutes of this show & binged watched it till the end.Now the performances of every actor was great. I genuinely loved all of the friends, supporting cast & bad guys too. It also reminded me of my school days with some good memories in the first episode. I think this one got it all from being funny to make us emotional & yeah the zombies too that were great!You know this one's underated when extremely below average & dumb Netflix shows like Money heist, Lupin etc., or the other Marvel's Disney+ Hotstar shows got above 90% on rotten tomatoes & shows like this got below 80%.Overall a highly recommend show to binge watch with your friends or family (No unnecessary sex scenes or nudity) . Waiting for the next season.",9
"Who doesn't love South Korean zombie productions, 'uh?This one has a cool overall concept, good visuals and a great atmosphere, with some great action scenes, especially some of the chase scenes with the students...... however, it also has severe flaws that nearly ruin the enjoyment.The pacing is horrible, especially in the first half of the show. The show goes to a crawl in some of the initial episodes. Extremely slow episodes with 1h10 run time is crazy. It also completely goes overboard with the clickity-clack loud sounds on the transformations earlier on, too many, too often, too frequently for too long.I won't go into stupid character decisions as plot devices, or the absurd emotional philosophical talks whilst zombies are about to overrun you, or the fact they repeat the 'person transforming into zombie in front of you and everyone watches eagerly' 3 or 4 times in the first episodes, since it's part of a typical zombie show, those are all 'acceptable' as is.Had this show been properly edited, or cut, with a lower, but more relevant run time, and it would have been a sensational hit. As it is, its actually tough to tolerate the bad, to enjoy the good.I liked the cast, most of them did ok, and hope to see some of them in future shows.",7
How can a human survive 3 days without food with a good health condition?And why its 12 episodes long? I am truly disappointed after watching this series.,4
"This is how a zombie series is made really. It was soo good, it got me hooked from the very start. The characters were just too good. The decisions considering their age seems justified. But some scenes were very comical, and stupid but those can be easily overlooked because I loved this.",10
"Loved this! I don't think there was a single episode that didn't keep me on the edge of my seat!It had a little of everything, plenty of violence, funny moments and some really touching moments which won't be everyone's cup of tea if they just want a run of the mill zombie movie!I thought it was fantastic, ended on a cliff hanger so already looking forward to the next season!",9
"All in all it's got everything you could want from the Zombie genre, while still avoiding some of the more cliche tropes.The characters get pretty good towards the later half of season 1, but early on they weren't all that interesting or likeable.For some reason most characters were constantly bickering, and being class A a-holes to each other for no reason. This got better quickly though, as the characters had a little time to develop.There seems to be a few inconsistencies so far, in who gets affected in what way by the virus, and why, but I expect that to be expanded upon in future seasons.",7
"Terrible story, massive plot holes, incredibly infuriatingly stupid scenes and literally no attachment to any character. I don't watch zombie movies at all and I generally dislike them so I had low expectations to begin with. However, I was actually looking forward to this and was incredibly optimistic, but this has sunk below my lowered optimistic expectations because every single minute there is something to complain about. I don't even care if it had a terrible plot as long as it was fun I would've been okay with it and I really tried hard to enjoy it.This is not an opinion, this is a fact because of just how much evidence there is to support what I'm saying.",3
"I loved it really. First of all this journal is my fav I love zombie movies,series yeah this is the second k-zombie series which I liked 1-KINGDOM
2- ALL OF US ARE DEAD.",10
"It starts out corny, predictable, bad scripting (or English Translations), and the students making absolutely horrible decisions, or not thinking of or ignoring obvious solutions, but it is entertaining enough to get you to episode 3/4 and then things get so much better. You actually care about the characters and there is some great acting, even through some of the pretty terrible English Translations and tones used by the voice over ""actors.""It is a very good series. You will be entertained. I do hope we get a season 2. This was up there with Squid Games for me as I got further into it, minus the mental illness of Squid Games lol.",8
"I love zombie movies not the low budget and corny acting zombies.. but TRAIN TO BUSAN WAS MY FAVORITE ZOMBIE MOVIE OF ALL TIME even though it's a foreign movie THAT SAYS A LOT... (Also watched the movie 5 years late after its first released)...
But this show ALL OF US DEAD... people disliking this show.. lack wisdom and emotion... when this show had all the above.. including hidden messages about humanity in general if you really are paying attention.. to the casting crew, script writers and director.. VERY WELL DONE!!! Koreans films are no joke! Love it! I want season 2 ASAP!!!",10
"There's a lot to unpack here, but the core problem is that there are maybe 6 great episodes worth of content in this 12 episode series.When it gets it right, it gets it very right. Love, loss, longing, poignancy, savagery and pathos, it's all there. The writing, acting and production are strong enough to get you engaged, so as the cast get chowed on, you'll feel it.However, it suffers from uneven tone, with too many cliched tropes and characters. Big-awkward guy, punky-girl, straight-laced nerd hottie, alpha and beta heroes, coward, and generic thug villain. You've seen them all before, many times.Some scenes eschew peril for jarring slapstick, which breaks you right out of immersion. There's far, far too much shrieking, repetition, indecision, repetition, pointless sacrifice, and repetition.Still, the effects, both practical, makeup and subtle CGI are top notch, the overall story arc is well conceived, and there are a few touching character developments.It's not amazing, but it's solid, and it ends strongly and credibly without pushing the To Be Continued too hard. Just about worth your time.",6
"Decent show - I will admit reading the other reviews I can kind of understand peoples opinions about the first 2 episodes, they are arguably the weakest, and things really pick up in episode 3 and especially in episode 4. Overall though, it's fun, jumpy, some fun characters and awesome zombie chase scenes. Another solid Korean flick - ignore the haters.",8
"I was so excited to see this. First three episodes were good but then sloppy writing took place. There is so much that happens that makes ZERO sense. How can people go days and days without water or food? Why wouldn't you hide in a house or store when you know zombies are headed for you; instead, you stand outside? You see someone you care for get bitten and is turning, but you cry and tell others not to kill them?Definitely, the writers need to be replaced for season two and stop writing material that makes no sense. Have some sense of reality and what could happen. The over dramatic teen angst and was too much. By then end, I wanted all of the characters to die because I was so frustrated with the shows.",5
So if you have 10 hrs to waste approx you can go ahead and watch this series just meaningless waste of time. After all this hype and korean drama suppose to be good.doesnt come even near our expectation.lame plot its like a loop same thing happening again and again.with same character.not a woth watch.,3
"First of all, the effects are good, even though the idea or the plot itself is not original, still an interesting premise to watch. HOWEVER, the characters are unlikeable, so many inconsistent things happened, the more you watch the plot is getting messier, so many dumb actions performed by the characters, like what? Wasting 15 seconds to shot a terrified face for each student while they can actually just throw the zombie out fast is dumb, really dumb. The love triangle doesn't even help with the characters chemistry. So yeah, disappointing.",4
"... but not in a good way. Three episodes in and I'm tired of the students making horrible decisions. From standing around while another student turns, tolerating another entitled student, settling on a classroom on another floor when there were plenty on the way to choose from, putting your fellow students and friends in danger by not disclosing that you've been bitten to feeling depressed in the middle of it all when you should feel a sense of urgency. They say that if you can't be a model by showing others how they should do things, be an example by showing others how they shouldn't do things. This series falls into the latter category. The only redeeming thing so far is that there is a fighter and a thinker in the group. Everybody else is, pretty much, useless and a liability. ""#Alive"" and ""Train to Busan"" were more comprehensive. They had their flaws, but not to the extent of this series.",3
"Japanese manga did this in 2006 it basically the same thing, the same concept and the character potrate is a tad similar to the manga. I dropped the series in the middle as it resembled the anime which is far better then the series i dont know if the series is inpired by the manga or what but i belive that its not worth the time. Its just a streached version of 24min per ep anime to the 1hr long ep of this series by making the character do the uncanny stupid things. But if you dont wanna watch the anime released in 2006 then its a nice series based on the anime.",1
"I stopped watching american zombie dramas and their other dramas, since they always include unnecessary adult scenes, sxx, etc. So happy i found korean dramas.I would give a 10 if only cheong san ending is different. This young actor is very good. They better bring him back in season 2.However other than that, the drama dan the ending is very satisfying.",9
"I looked forward to this kdrama and the trailer was quite good as well. So, I had expectations for it. I even completed reading the Web toon to get ready for the watch.But, it was kind of disappointing. I directly compared this drama to ""Happiness"", which is another Zombie centric drama that was aired just mere months ago. While ""Happiness"" had a lot of things right and had found a right balance between the Zombie action and human interactions, ""All of Us Are Dead"" was just mindless actions in most of the episodes. Sometimes quite repetitive to the point that we can easily predict the outcome.I liked the four leads, but other than the characters of Lee Cheongsan and Nam Ohjo which were built well, Lee Suhyeok and Choi Namra's characters could have given much depth. Especially Namra's who had the most interesting character arc. But hers was not explored till the last episode.Likewise there were so many things that fell short of expectations. Including the final explanation that the Webtoon carried. Anyhow, the drama is still enjoyable and the action is good. The settings and choreography are well done as well.Good effort. But overall, the drama is just okay.",6
Series was great till middle and I was hooked.. and then episode 8 came and the director took us all for stupid and ruined it. I get it you want to have 12 episode but why ruin it?,2
"I don't get those people giving bad reviews about All of us Are Dead! I enjoyed every episode from start to finish. It never loses its momentum. In fact, 12 episodes to me are not that long. I am hoping for a season 2.This show covers everything relevant to societal issues like the pandemic, bullying, political influence, pressure of getting into college, family relationships, friendship, love, human behaviours. I love how they included the youtuber character because he's not just for comedy but it's a reality that people would do stupid thing just for social media views.I like how they got into detail of the origin of the virus and the mechanism of the virus. Most zombie movies don't go into detail with the origin of the virus (usually it's chemical spill and things like that).Each episode keeps you wanting more and the actors played their parts perfectly. The female protagonist, On-Jo is a very realistic character. She's not one of those badass superhero frontal heroine but like most of us, she's an ordinary girl who has to deal with the pain of losing loved ones and yet keep going for the ones who are still alive.This show isn't just about surviving or killing zombies. It shows you every human relationship. In this show, although they show you how cruel humans can be, it also highlights the good side of humans and how one is willing to sacrifice for the good of others.The side stories are all put together very well, without spoiling the main plot. I disagree with the comments saying there are too many unnecessary plots or characters because every side story has an impact and every character has a story to tell.Plot wise, acting wise, visuals, effects, everything is phenomenal. 10/10 absolutely!",10
"Oh Korea what have you done?! You have ruined the good name for quality shows you once had by making this atrocious zombie tv show. Episode 1 was long enough to tell your story and end it and it may have been ok, but 12 episodes, wow. 12 episodes of the worst thing I have seen in many years. Congratulations.",3
"There is a LOT of drama in this show which at times was a little bit hard to believe because there's an actual zombie apocalypse happening and these high school kids are still worrying about ""who likes who"" and throwing temper tantrums and the protagonist girl giving the cold shoulder to the protagonist guy who has a major crush on her.I also really didn't like how it seemed like the most important person to save during the entire show was On-jo. So many people sacrificed their lives for her and yet she was being so selfish throughout the entire show.But I was willing to look past all of that, as long as they were going to let my man Cheong-san get the girl in the end. But NOPE! They made Cheong-san a simp for On-jo the entire show and then the second she finally starts treating him right, they kill him off.I don't know if this is typical in K-dramas but they made a lot of the guys weak, timid, bumbling buffoons. There was A LOT of female-on-male violence which was more than annoying and the males were always scared of the females and just took their beatings like wimps.There were significantly more female students alive at the end than males, so it promotes the idea that males are expendable and should sacrifice themselves for the females, but also that the females were smarter and better survivors.I'm also mad about them killing off some of the best characters. Like for example they killed off the scientist who created the virus pretty early when he could have played a bigger role in the show. On-jo's dad spent the entire show trying to find her, he finally finds her and then gets bit within 2 seconds of finding her.The episodes are long (around 1hr each) and there is 12 of them so it starts to get a bit exhausting with all the drama but the ending was okay because they left it open for a sequel season but at the end of the day.I enjoyed the show at times and was annoyed at other times so that's why it gets a 5/10. If they let my man Cheong-san live and get the girl in the end it would've been a 7/10 but they did him dirty. Lived and died a simp. Shameful.",5
Seriously guys if your going to get paid to write a review by Netflix at least give it a 8. People giving this a 10 is the most ridiculous thing ever.. it's ok I guess maybe because I watched the English dubbed version they may have screwed it up or made it corny on purpose I'm not sure.. giving this a 10 is actually insulting too people who read reviews to be honest.,5
"Low budget and the story really sucks it is very slow. The characters are all very annoying, it's just dumb. I think the writers like bullies. If you want to waste time getting annoyed you might want to watch this. This show is not for me.",3
Watch it now would do anything to be able to watch it for the first time again i feel empty whenever i'm not watching this but i feel like the shouldn't of killed off cheong su. And should've included more scenes of su hyeok (bare-su) and isak should've died a bit later on so it was more emotional. Diffenatley recomend want to be nam tamra tbh.,10
This was a good zombie series ever i seen before. Egurly waiting for second season. I hope this series will release in all languages. We all waiting for tamil dubbing.,10
"This series is an excellent series i haven't watch earlier this type of series i love this I want season 2
Netflix if you watch the comments please
I eagerly waiting for season 2
I really love the gang.",10
"A story of a father's frustration towards his son not being able to fight back against bullies lead him to create a virus that improves a persons animalistic nature and craving for violence.Although this movie trended worldwide, the step back to how old zombie movies were portrayed was really annoying. The sheer number of ""pause before you act"" moments is the total opposite of how humans act when in danger. One student even mentioning he watched Train to Busan, but still did not know how to act when being hunted by zombies.Also the way the script tries to insert love story has cause the film to be flimsy at times. Givent he fact that these are kids, i can understand that crushes and love are a big deal for them, but i find it irrelevant on this film.Another issue i find with this film is the way they include a ""final boss(Gui-Nam)"" in an already convoluted story. Yet, the final goal of the antagonist was really shallow. Fight sequences usually involves people standing and doing nothing while watching their friends being beaten up.And lastly if you expect a solution and/or a happy ending for this story, there is none. This is the most common way for directors to tell you, ""to be continued...""Overall, it's a good take on the horror of how a government, it's policies, and humans react when their lives are on the line. This movie is good, but would have been better.On a side note, please please can't zombie movies have intelligent protagonist. It's 2022 people, most individuals should have watched one or two zombie movies already.",4
There is no coherence whatsoever: zombie turning may go from seconds to several minutes depending on the character. The amount of stupid decisions and unrelatable characters get me siding with the zombies by the 2nd episode. Save yourself from this.,2
That girl in the white hoodie took my nerves.So annoying af ngl I nearly quit that show so annoying this girl was. Who cast her ? Real question WHO ? Was that guy on some pills or something ?,7
"First you run, then you hide and you fight.Great zombies story, with a beginning very well written..Too much drama I guess, but it's a corean thing..",9
This is not just another spin off on the zombie genres. The Koreans have given it a twist and added lots of emotional elements to it. One can relate to each and every character in this series. I am shocked at the talent coming out of South Korea - how do they find such great actors? Each and every person has put so much effort and it shows throughout the 12 episodes. The scale is huge and Netflix has put lot of money in this. Please watch it straightaway if you haven't already.Me and my wife are looking forward to season 2 already :),9
"First, I highly recommend watching with original audio and subtitles. The dub version voice acting is just not engaging enough.This classic zombie plot series stands out by deeply portraying a variety of characters who don't typically frustrate the viewer by making poor decisions. You begin to connect with the characters and empathize with their decisions. Don't get too cozy with them as the series takes a GOT ""no character is safe"" approach.From start to finish each zombie encounter felt real. Nothing seemed too absurd including the various emotional impacts of certain decisions.Excellent series with minimal areas for improvement!",9
"I did noy expect this movie to be very good but it did surprise me in many ways. Definitely its the best zombie movie right now.It has pretty much everything - good evolving story, zombies, kids, love stories and politicians, nice cliff hangers in each episode etc.",10
"I really looked forward to this Kdrama, I'm a huge fan of Korean shows and as always i'm thankful that I started watching this. I think I have it a 8/10 because I'm not a huge fan of zombie movies or series but after all it was really good.",8
"Over all show was ok. Too long. Characters kind of doing the same thing over and over again, episode after episode. Started out ok as things fall apart. Decent stories on the people involved. Really started to drag about half way. Too many repeat battles with the main antagonist. Srsly? Ending couple of episodes were a bit better than the middle episodes. I think this genre has gone on a little too long.",5
"I enjoy K-Drama with Train to Busan going down as a top 5 zombie movie of all time. In it, you saw the motivations for why people acted the way that they did.In this series, I think the mistake was having 12 episodes, meaning they had to stretch out the story using manufactured drama, lots of it, in every single show. There was no reasoning or explanation on people's actions and reactions(Episode 3 will make you toss something at your TV). Also, having a very weak protagonist who causes the death of other people is never a good idea. This series is more closely related to dreadful Army of Dead than Train to Busan. Most of the decisions are just plot devices for failure. At one point you stop caring who lives or who dies.The people who like this will be the same people that say Real Housewives is good reality TV or really liked Twilight. The rest of us is a no.",4
It's wonderful series I can't wait for 2nd session. I finished this series within 12 hours I watched still a night because I can't stop myself to stop watching this amazing series.,10
"I just dont get the hype on this, its just another cliché, high school zombie apocalypse movie. I just dont get the hype on this, its just another cliché, high school zombie apocalypse movie. I just dont get the hype on this, its just another cliché, high school zombie apocalypse movie. I just dont get the hype on this, its just another cliché, high school zombie apocalypse movie.",6
"Is by far the best thing about this show, that kid was a legend! Ha.Was actually routing for him in this......but I can't figure out how the squid game girl looks about 10 years younger in this ?",8
"Korean shows tend to be really hit or miss for me. Sweet Home, My Name, and Squid Game are all great shows with well-developed characters who act in a believable way given their situations. This show is definitely a miss for me though. The writing seems to focus only on making things dramatic; characters do terrible and dumb things for no discernible reason, since in many cases they haven't been developed enough. The kid on the roof who we barely know screws everyone over because... reasons? The Military commander is ruthlessly evil in some scenes and then in other scenes tries to take the high ground and and lament what they have to do, and it just doesn't feel coherent. The writers also forgot that humans need water to survive, even though one of the students says in one of the earlier episodes that they are already dehydrated. It even starts raining at one point and NOT ONE PERSON thinks to get a bucket or something and collect some drinking water. The EMS father finds a stockpile of guns and only brings one because ...? And then he gives his only gun away before he even gets to the school? Soooo much stupidity in this show. I could go on and on but you get the point. If all you want is drama and you don't care about character decisions making sense, then by all means give this show a go. But if you are the type who gets annoyed when characters behave in dumb or unbelievable ways, stay far, farrr away.",4
"I've watched a lot of zombie movies and TV over the years, and I thought All of Us Are Dead was among the best. The action was often incredibly exciting and tense, and the high school students' developing relationships seemed emotionally believable to me. (I mostly watched in Korean with English subs - the English dubbing struck me as weak, causing many dialogue exchanges to sound stilted and overacted.)Also, even when I like an action show where a group of characters is in constant danger, I usually think repeatedly, ""You're such an idiot, you deserve to be killed."" But I can't remember thinking that here. Sometimes the characters make mistakes, but, to me at least, they're realistic mistakes that might actually happen in stressful moments.Anyway, it's the rare new series like this one that keeps me from cancelling Netflix.",9
Its an averge teen zombie series the only thing special about this one is the action scene in 1st and 2nd episode its filming really well .. after that is gets bad .............,5
"All good but ending was disappointed me. And too longer Series , maximum 8 episode for this series. Not so good not so bad .One time watchable.ygyhck ufjxdjvhb dydhvkbjc.",7
"Although there were some minor illogic scenes but overall its good. Its not a waste even its a paid drama. Its too short though, should be 16 or 20 episodes.The ending reveals that there will be a sequel which I can't wait.",8
"Storywise, I like this series better than ""Happiness"" because the happy ending is not too forced.However, in terms of the actors, especially the ML and FL, Happiness won. Both ML and the FL are so good looking and attractive in Happiness while on this ""All of us are dead"" are not as attractive as the other series.Nevertheless, Hyeong syuk - Nam Ra are definitely my favorite characters here.The zombies were also more realistic here than Happiness.Another part that I feel very realistic was when they needed to go to the toilet. The fact that you're fighting the living dead doesn't make you immune to pooping and peeing!!I hope there would be 2nd season bc I'm curious about Nam Ra story.",8
"It actually started off great. Interesting characters, very creative cinematography, and great acting. But as the show went on, it got dumber and dumber with plot holes, bad writing, inconsistencies and things that just don't make sense. I was hoping this would be a Korean 'series', along the likes of Kingdom, Extracurricular, Stranger, Squid Game to name a few. But instead it's just a 'K-drama' with zombies. To give credit where credit is due; the acting for the most part is excellent. The cinematography (at least in the earlier episodes) is very creative, especially the one take sequence in episode 2. The stunts by everyone (especially the zombie actors) is incredible and the action choreography is excellent. Just wish it was written and directed better.",5
You will really like this web series .The main strong point in this series is the all character have performed their best and it will make audience strongly bond with character.please ye series ko ek baar jarur dekhiye.,10
At first it seemed mostly korean soap drama but as it progresses the story gets better and better. It was enjoyable and I liked the way people would react (from ordinary people to military and even political people).,9
"I honestly had no idea of what I was getting into. I only recently got into KDrama so this is a whole new thing. But I'm not going to give this a 10 star as for my anger towards the huge unexpected plot twists! Yet in a way its intriguing and entertaining. I did cry about this show because of the way the main characters died, but I also was angry of how it's displayed the term zombies. Sure its not a scientific explanation of zombies but I feel it could've been different by the normal stereotype. I did feel a little sick of how real it looks though!",8
"Well yes there are some plot hole in this series but yeah idk I didn't care at all LOL
The tension and thrilling moments are so good and fun, I just enjoy when watch this series.Namra is the coolest and my favorite character in here. I keep watching this because of her. She's so brave and calm and wow...just cool. The love story between Namra and Suhyeok is my favorite scene. I NEED THE SEASON 2 ASAP!",8
"Poor script, bad acting, repetitive, bad editing, average CGI. This is good for teens who never watched great zombie movies before like Train To Busan, Walking Dead, World War Z, 28 Days Later, 28 weeks later.",5
"All Of Us Are Dead is mind blowing web series. It's special for me as like other Korean movies and series it's really close to reality with small fictional touch and it beautifully show cases every possible human reaction and thinking people can make in such place.My Review is 10 of 10 ??
A perfect mixture of action l, drama l, humour, love and emotion.",10
"What a story... It's marvellous every episode is very interesting and very emotional when someone turned into zombies.. Especially your favourite characters... Hatts off such an exciting, engaging, n thriller story...wait for season 2.",10
"Okay, first thing first, I'm not a fan of zombie movie or series AT ALL. But this show was still good and I was binge-watching and finished watching for 1.5days.The plot was probably nothing special, but still well-made and enough to make me addicted. The story is combined with fear, teenagers love story, family love and some hint of resemblance of Covid-19 world.",9
"This show had me from the very first frame, the cinematography is what drew me in first, then the story and the actors all are excellent in their roles. There is so much going on in each episode and each episode is an hour or so Long. I'm on episode 7 and can't wait for my boyfriend to get off of work so we can watch the rest Tonight. This is a crazy good show.",10
"This is easily the best Korean drama I've ever seen. The action is sustained, well-paced and highly engaging, the stunt choreography is arguably the best I've seen across any genre, any country, and the acting and script are top notch. It avoids the repetitive and expositional motifs of a lot of Korean tv, doesn't have any significant filler and manages to keep saccharine moments to a minimum for what is mainly a high school horror drama. The episodes fly by despite being either side of an hour in length, and while I would love a 2nd series, it sits perfectly as a stand-alone. The zombies are scary and amusing at the same time, it has mastered Korean tv's knack for intrinsic comic timing, and the villains are genuinely intimidating. Also the best zombie tv show I've ever seen, tonally it's more 28 Days Later than the Walking Dead (thank god). 100/10, would recommend.",10
"The show started in a brilliant way and I thought this would be some unique in the zombie genre. As things were shown in a very realistic way. But, the way the episodes moved forward I started to lose interest. As I felt some middle episodes were so repetitive & lengthy. The show didn't deserve 12 hrs runtime. After finishing the season I can say the story would've been completed within 8 - 9 hrs max. One thing I can't deny is that this show was technically brilliant.Each character had its own story, it's not a problem for a series. But, in a Zombie apocalypse it has been shown in a very stretchy way. In the other hand, some characters didn't end up the way they should've been. As an audience we get to know so many things but the character didn't, that's the reason it was very disturbing to watch some scenes. Last 4 episodes were too much interesting and were the best episodes of the show. Good thing is that we get to know some good survival techniques.Finally, it's not the best in zombie genre but of course A Very Good Watch.Available on Netflix.© Zombieddict.",7
This was amazing! I actually enjoyed this series more than Squid Game! Everything was perfectly timed. A lot of the characters had development and grew throughout the series. Wonderful! Can't wait for season 2!,10
"Despite being helm by a primarily a young cast of high school students, everyone delivered their roles really well, and you could really feel their emotions as they make their ways through the endless waves of zombie attacks, dealing with the sadness of losing their friends/loved ones and struggling to stay hopeful in the wake of such dire circumstances.Overall, it was a genuinely enjoyable zombie thriller where you will feel the excitement, laugh and cry together with the students as they fight for survival!",1
"I like South Korean movies and series. But what a waste this one, a typical Netflix production. No strong story, directing and not ever once complelling. Too bad SK.",5
"Honestly looks like they had everything (budget) to make this a great tv show
unfortunately is horrible and poorly written.The characters omg , where should l start?Are we suppose to do think that teens in schools are so dumb?Zero skills to survive or think head ?One of the main character the fight fighter daughter , shockingly slow and dumb or maybe she has some mental issues?But overall all the characters super sad, pathetic, useless.Why did the writers write such a thing?Not even one of them was switch on.Also some flashbacks about happy memories super super cheesymaybe if you are a boy/girl under 10years old you might love it but if you have some decent intelligence you might feel this is extremely sad and dumb.Example they see someone no zombie yet and they wait until he/she become a zombie and then they start screaming :P instead of killing it before
. That happened many many times.And many others situation are actually hard to watch.The Adults acting is actually very bad too.Like l said before its a shame because they had all to make this great.And instead they made everyone useless and no charismatic at all.I couldn't have any sympathy with any of them at all.Please try to make it a little realistic at least a little this was sad.",1
"When I first started watching this show I was interested in the plot. The first few episodes were really promising, like something big was going to come in the future. Well that never came. After the first half of the show, it became stale and the main characters took every wrong decision possible without any reason at all, which led to them getting killed of.Another thing that bothered me is that the main characters ignored the fact that the zombies could be killed by stabbing them to the neck, although some of them did it a lot of times. I mean like nobody said ""Hey the zombies can be killed by stabbing them to the neck, maybe we should just kill them instead of pushing them"".Good try but not enough. 6/10.",6
"This show has all the check-marks you'd expect from a fairly high budget show.And yet, it all falls completely flat as it tries to present a gruesome horror setting, combined with corny and comedic anime-like characters and situation handling.It's watchable from start to finish ... but you really need to turn your brain off ... almost to the point like a zombie at at least half of it ...Some episodes are bloated by either dragged out scenes or by repetition. Watching someone turn for the 6th time, in the same dramatic way, without previously building an emotional connection to those characters is played out by the 3rd episode.Most of the situations are handled borderline moronic, and the consistency of the plot is reminiscent of a wet fart.The worst of it was suffered by the dialog. It was either written by a computer, or a person who'd previously had very little social interaction with others.If I'd have to come up with key-words that best describe the show, they would be: inconsistent, borderline comedic, dragged out and non-sensical.I still can't decide if this was intended to be a comedy or a satire of the zombie genre, because it definitely can't be taken serious as horror/drama. And the show is self aware of what it's trying to do, as its characters reference the far better executed Train to Busan in more then once.I'm aware that it's a zombie movie, so it's a ""turn your brain off"" kind of viewing, but this show puts absolutely no effort into trying to take itself serious even within it's own imaginary world.This would have worked 100% better as an animated feature considering the cartoonish characters situation handling and presentation.",5
"When it's come to South Korea series, There's always fans who voted 10/10 instantly.Some character is annoying as hell with no backup reason. Some character can be so dumb in one scene, and be so smart in the next scene.If you don't like to watch series with a bunch of stupid decisions and stupid plot, you will not enjoy this series.Btw, I'm actually a South-Korea Series fan, but not this one.",4
"Its horrible, I didn't enjoy any of it except for episode 1 that's the only reason im giving it 3 stars. It has bad acting for example On-jo never moves her arms its like they're just there, and the shots where they talk it feels like they aren't even talking to eachother. And don't get me on how stupid the characters are especially the students, even though they know what zombies are and everything they never get a weapon, it never crosses their mind to be quiet and in the first classroom it never crossed their minds to block the windows. It has massive plotholes and the storyline is just bad.",3
"Great story and very relatable characters, even tho some of them are incredibly annoying but that just gives more points to realism of charachter diversity. 10/10.South Korea really made them self a king when it comes to zombie genre with entries like Train to Busan, Kingdom and now this beautiful gem.",10
"An absolute gem, great story, great acting and fantastic make up and effects. Flew through the season and left me hoping for season 2. I can't recommend enough. Teen woes, deadly zombie virus, desperate rescues and sacrifices. No one is safe.",10
"The series is very wonderful and luxury, it is full of action, mystery and zombies, it was as if I lived the atmosphere like them, here I learned the value of teamwork and how to survive without food or drink.",9
"This show had some things going for it. The government that is actually competent, the original (as far as I know) idea of halfbies and the fact that's it not in the US made me hope for a unique take on a zombie show.However, this show falls into the same mistakes as so many of its competitors: illogical decisions and behaviour by the survivors. It tires me to think how many times this show did the thing where everybody stand around the person who is, as everyone is very aware of, about to turn into a zombie, but instead of taking advantage of the zombies weakness before it fully turns, they stare at it with mouths wide open. This stands among many plot holes and issues I had with the show, from very general things like the dumb self-sacrifices to specific things like the forest hiking sequence in the last episode where On-Jo follows the golden ribbons. I don't think I have to explain why that scene was ridiculous.Going into this show, I was excited for a good take on a zombie show and was, in most aspects, disappointed.",6
One of the best zombie shows I've ever watched and I've watched a lot. Amazing from start to finish. Likeable characters awesome action scenes lots of gore. Korean tv at its best.,10
It's just Fantastic from the starting till the end it keeps the audiance entertained not even a second u ll feel bore ....I'm waiting for season 2 .....when season one is excellent i don't know how they will keep up the same excitement for season 2 bcz it's not possible to make thgs even better than season 1 ....,10
"As an avid zombie fan I put this in my top 5 best zombie shows / movies of all time. The acting from the zombies is phenomenal. It's realistic feeling, blood everywhere, bodies slamming every which way exactly like it would be if this were real life. I have wondered in several scenes whether anyone actually got hurt, I mean they go HARD. Could the dubbing be better - of course, I'm yet to see a dubbed show or movie that couldn't have been better however this is the best I've seen yet. I can only hope they make more like this.",10
"Brain-dead, that is.When they don't use their heads, they get eaten.When they try to use their heads, they do it badly, and get eaten.Then they do it again.Slightly less lazy writers could have made the series a banger.The actors and everyone besides the writers did a great job.How many characters is 150?

"I'm amazed how many of you are saying that is a great zombie idea.I'll tell you is NOT.First episode started well and then when infection strikes all of the students started to play too dumb, their reaction is not realistic at all, when you see zombies coming to you, you simply run like hell not playing around the zombie crowdAfter 5 minutes of second episode I said NO. It' not worth my time.",4
"Last episode let it down with characters making stupid decisions to go after lost causes and having weak dialog. I think the show could have concluded on the 11th episode and I'd have been happy at that. At the best of times the show was frustrating watching characters bicker with each other in life and death situations or seeing them needlessly sacrifice themselves.Another particularly frustrating thing to see was Nam-Ra only utilise her strength in the last episode when she could have done more in previous episodes to help the group.Also at times it was very convenient how dozens zombies would be chasing characters in one scene, and then in the next scene it wouldn't show how the characters had somehow outran them, the particular scene coming to mind is Onjo's father in the stairwell during the evacuation of the politicians.Some things I really liked: the virus origin story, it was refreshing to see a different take with a zombie virus that could be explained. And with a sad story behind it. I also really enjoyed the setting of most of it taking place in the school. The show was very tense at times, and the setting really added to it.I really liked Park Mi-Jin, her bratty attitude and lines were very funny. And Onjo's father and his undying will to save his daughter really added the sad drama to the show.The show also created some very good characters which you want to see fall, and it delivers on that front as well.Overall while not a perfect show, it is very entertaining and delivers a fresh addition to the zombie genre. Hopefully that is the show done because I wouldn't want to see them make another season.",7
"Netflix's bots are rating this up, otherwise I don't understand how this could be a +7 / almost 8 serie. Do you a favor and don't loose time with this one.",1
"A different kind of zombie story with good actors and lots of goore, but suffers from inconsistence wrighting.Interesting plot, realistic science and creative tactics.Stupid characters, ridiculous logical decisions and lots of plot holes.All in all a show i recommend to watch, if you can stand people screaming all the time while still trying to hide from flesheating zombies attracted to sound.",7
"From like 20 characters only 3-4 characters who have good acting, the rest is meh, many plot holes,and the story is average,the characters doing dum thing and that make no sense because it workwith that budget they should make a far better series than this,kingdom is far better than this if you want watch korean zombie.Character development is meh,
the only good character is the bully villain with white jacket, the annoying girl with pink jacket and the mc.The Dectetive,the one who good in fight,the Big boy,mc best friend,and class leader is decent,the rest team is trash, fmc trash, archer girl and her friends trashthe only good thing about this series is cinematography.",5
"All of us are deadBursting with well executed zombie action scenes and a plot that's as emotional as it is dire and dreadful. It is also teeming with an array of characters that you would love and hate. It starts and ends well, in a way that accommodates a second season if approved.It was also overly long and drawled, leaving room for so much redundancy. A lesser number of episodes with shorter runtime would have worked better.",8
"The show is intense but still has humor. Not as dark as the Kingdom, but intense enough for a zombie show. I think it is the only zombie show that looks so much into the humanity and relationship, and social problems. So in that sense, it is quite soft, not as hardcore as the Kingdom.",8
I do like this show alot for what it is. The plot is engaging and emotional and the action scenes are exciting I just have one problem with it that was frequent throughout. If you're one of those people that hate when people make dumb decisions in scary movies you will agree with me here. There is way too much standing around when people should be running away.. and does somebody have to coincidentally fall down every time they are running to add suspense? If someone you know gets bitten do you really need to stand there and cry for 5 min while zombies are actively chasing you. Just so many situations where common sense in a survival situation is just thrown out the window and it just kills me sometimes lol. But besides that I'd say this is overall a good zombie show and despite my criticisms I still binge watched the whole thing as apparently I still wanted to see more/what would happen next.,7
I really don't understand the logic behind all of these good reviews. Only watched two episodes and I couldn't find myself to finish the rest. The concept was good but watching a show where all the characters are dumb af is extremely aggravating and makes you want to throw the remote at the screen. Every character makes stupid decisions and just stands there and does nothing the entire time. This show was a joke. Nothing compared to the masterpiece of train to Busan.,1
I really wanted to like this series. Interesting start. Lovable and hateable characters. Wayyyyyyyy overdrawn and annoying at times. They jumped the shark so many times.The plot holes are cavernous.It's so cheesy it's disgusting.It's pretty much anime in live action. Not in a good way.,2
"Just finished the last episode of All of Us Are Dead, and was so utterly underwhelmed that it felt like taking to IMBd to write my first and only review was the closest I'd come to feeling vindaction after being duped by the +7 average rating.For the people checking out the IMDb ratings, weighing whether or not to get into this show like I was, there are no spoilers, because this review is for you.Having watched Squid Game and Parasite, I was quick to buy in to the high praise, figuring I could get past a quirk or two that comes with the dubbed over English translation, in lieu of a good storyline. There were definitely quirks, but more glaring were the absurdly ridiculous plot holes, (ie. Seemingly insurmountable situations inexplicably overcome courtesy of a convenient cut scene), unrealistic/completely irrational behavior of the characters in the show (where the thought that ""no one in their right mind would do that"" takes away from the everything else), and protagonists that flat out suck to watch.Giving credit where credit is due - I did watch all 12 episodes after all; albeit, teetering on turning it off the entire time. It brings just enough to the table to keep you invested in terms of production value and SFX. I will also say, it does bring a fresh take to the zombie genre as other reviewers have mentioned.But all of the good is heavily outweighed by the crimgeworthy dialogue, the comically poor decisions of the main characters, and the lazy writing leading to jarring gaps in storyline.If you read this and decide to watch anyway, which you probably will, do yourself a favor by drastically lowering your expectations. And if after the first 11 episodes, you aren't yet completely pissed off that you're still watching, then the last episode will surely do the trick, (ep 12 is an infuriating turd of a conclusion that will finally confirm your suspicions that, yes, you too were also catfished by that 7.7 IMDb rating"").",4
"Guess what this Gen Z said ""This show is so violent "" lol what ? This is zombie apocalypse not romance, do you think this is Hollywood when there's kisses and nudity and cringy criticism? No this is korean they work so hard , they have incredible actors and all the crews behind camera , this is not WARM BODIES OR WORLD WAR Z , if you want no violent shows go somewhere in Netflix you will find bunch of garbage, btw I loved this series and I hope to see more of this story in future because we all now that netflix doesn't care if you liked or not ,they care about views numbers if this is successful so 100% there's s2 and 3 .",10
If you want crippling depression this show will give it for sure. It has fantastic writing which builds suspense and has meaningful characters. I would definitely watch this show with someone as it can get really intense. It is never hard to follow and has a solid plot. I enjoyed watching this show even though it did not end like I would have wanted.,10
"""All of us are dead"" is a classic zombie drama with a lot of action, thriller and horror elements. Even though the story is nothing groundbreaking, it doesn't fail to deliver enjoyment to the viewers that seek for zombies and epic action.My overall impression of the drama's story is not very great, not very bad either. It was a mediocre story and there were many unnecessary and illogical things for me to accept. Also, several same (or almost same) things and events happened which made the story repetitive and tedious at times. What I liked the most, was how it manages to show how differently everyone acts in order to survive or to save someone else.",7
"Another master piece of Korean Zombie movies. After Train to Bushan this is a take to live the struggle to live. Average 12 hours are worth giving. All characters did strong enough to wait for next season. Among all this kind of movies realizes us that what is different to be a human. Relationship, family and friends. The sacrifices which worth to keep your beloved breathing.LOVED the 12 hours waiting for another.",8
"I started this show with very high hopes, as it's first episodes shown well done Zombie action. The makeup was really great, the effects were cool, and overall, everything Zombie related was pretty well done. And although that persisted throughout the episodes, I must say that it's script is, sadly, one of the stupidest, worst written and most obnoxious ones I've watched in a long time.Every time, every single time, a character opened their mouth or made any kind of decision, I just wished for all the cast to be eaten by zombies right then and there. Every single death from this first season was due not to the zombies themselves, but to every single character in the show having less common sense than a rock. Characters made the worst decisions they could have for every single scenario.This became extremely obnoxious half through the season, and the last two chapters I just straight skipped dialogue scenes because I couldn't bear to watch more of the plot.The zombies are cool tho, so if you are a fan of the genre, I guess it's still enjoyable to some extent. Just be prepared for the plot.",5
I like this korean series... The emotional scenes and the characters are the highlighted one.also the acting of gwi nam is truly wonderful.does chong san really died? I give hope for the return of chong san.. He is such a awesome character... I liked him. Waiting for 2nd season.,9
"Simply put, this series had a great opening but jumped the shark as quickly as it began. The characters are what reduced my score from potential 8 stars. They simply became too annoying from half-way and on. I got so infuriated with the teenagers whining and arguing to no end. The whole season was like watching a cat fight. I can see one or two brash characters, but almost all of them either physically or mentally abuse one other. Is that Korean culture for kids to act that way? There are barely any redeemable quality any of the teens possessed. And some plots dragged for far too long like Gwami and the suicidal girl (forgot her name). She is the perfect character to be redeemed; to do something that mattered to the plot in a positive way. Sadly they made her an even more of a depressing villain. It's sad to say, but I kind of wished all of the kids turned at the end. They were that badly written.",4
"Although this is a Teenage horror. It is probably rated 19+ for the gore. The horror, as in other Kdramas ike Squid Game, Hellbound, is something other than the obvious. It is also about the people around you and bullying - even when you turned into a zombie.That's the clever part. But there are inconsistencies (like unnecessary sacrifices, stupid moves, and turning up the sentiments - parents dying ), some continuity issues in the beginning and maybe suffers a bit from a large cast. The chaos breaks out at end of episode 1 before all the characters were introduced just to grab your attention. And that is a bit hasty. We want entertainment, but we are not starved.At first there were multiple groups, including the cop that was interviewing the science teacher, the first aid x military dad, the arrow group and the main group in the music studio. This is needed to connect and elaborate the story but you know who is the main character group is. It would be too perfect for bullied girl to get even with the annoying bullying guy. There are some good plot points with mutation, rain/ thunder and toilet making.There are also well done set pieces like the intentional infection, rooftop scenarios and the dispair turning into some hope last episode. Technically well done but some holes like martial law can order such a strike without Parliament/heads of state approval? The assembly person seems to be a setup for next season? The rain gave them water, but no food for like 4-5days???",7
This web Series Batter then other Zombie web series.And i really like this all characters.spacial Nam-ra an gwi-nam. And This series want a 9/10 Rating.An I want know about last scene..?An I'm very excited for second Season.,9
"Only get what netflix has and this is ten times better than that new overacted series Chocolate its nice to see a Korean man treat a lady politely unlike the majority of KD.
It's silly and cute but people do die in it so not just a soft series.",9
"Recently, I have been trying so hard to get hooked on another K- drama. All I ask is that they keep the humor fresh and the romance sweet.In two episodes, I am already drawn in. I now hope that some romance occurs, but the future of this drama is yet to be determined.The series follows Ye Ri, a South Korean heiress when she accidentally falls into North Korea after a paragliding accident. All because of a tornado that had flying tractors. I laughed when she pointed that out.I hope Ye Ri has a good character development arc, I would love to see her grow. You bet I will continue to watch this. Sign me up, you got a fan.",10
"Look id give this a 10 but I'm only into it 5 episodes in and who knows if its gonna get stupid i dont think it will but will adjust my rating later if needed, typical i hate 90% of KD for the obvious reasons but the 10% that are good are really good and have to say this is pretty flawless, the two main characters have chemistry and the writing is spot on.I you dont like this your wasting your time with KD because this is first rate in every way.
this should be the highest rated show in Korea but it isn't because it's not a childish romcom per say",9
"I don't watch much KD or Korean movies as so many are the same kind of romance drama repackaged. So far this one has kept my interest except when Yoon Se-ri stopped being the strong woman she started out as.
One reason this KD does not have a higher rating in SK and US is that it airs on cable channel/pay TV/ Netflix which normally have a relatively smaller audience compared to free-to-air TV/public broadcasters (KBS, SBS, MBC and EBS).",9
"What makes this KD different from other KDs?
1. They used older actors which IMO are better in acting. Hyun Bin & Son Ye Jin are definitely the best choice for RJH & YSR character. The chemistry are inevitable!
2. The story is flawless and not boring. There's a speck of love story, comedy, and action in one KD. What not to love?
3. Beautiful sceneries. Omo.
4. Everything makes sense. No stupid magic or ghosts whatever.",10
"Anywhere from ""Memories of the Alhambra"" to extreme like ""Rampant"" , ""Crash Landing on You"" is by far more captivating. Anywhere from little hints to Looks of shuttle love gets me on the edge of my seat, but it's his emotions that make it so heartbreaking. He really brings so much emotional acting to the scenes and I should have known watching memories of the Alhambra. But, this has definitely got me hooked. Everyone wants a knight and shining armor with an edge. Korean dramas are much more on spot compared to many and I have to say the writers went where the love and mystery meet...where no one can go. Thank you and I hope to continue watching many more!",10
"I even joined to this page to rate u guys. that's the only way we can pay our gratitude for u on making such a great drama. I really love this drama.I've got no words. I love the whole team guys.
I've been waiting for something like this and happy that i was recieved it. I am so in love with all actors and most specifically Hyun Bin and Ye jin. Thanks for the amazing acting.
Don't like to get addicted to dramas,that's what I usually do.But I failed this time. I am so much crazy about the whole drama,can't even wait up for new ones.
Anyway,will remember this love story forever and i hope there's gonna be a happy ENDING.
Love and hugs for y'all.
Sew from Sri Lanka...",10
"I didn't have words describe this drama.
I love the two actors
the chemistry between them very beautiful
I can't wait each week for new episode ????????",10
This is as romantic as Colin firths Pride and prejudice. It pulls my heartstrings perfectly. Great story with no obvious way to resolve the conflicts. (Love that I am spending time wondering what will happen next and then being surprised by what actually happens!) Very well crafted (I particularly love the music). Super cast. I'm on episode 8 and it's a 10/10 so far. Irish romantic comedy fan.,10
If you're looking for a drama with a different storyline and a different atmosphere it would be a perfect choice.The actors play natural and they won't disappoint you.There is always a beautiful smile on my face each time I watch an episode.I haven't watched the whole episodes yet but sure will love it till the end.,8
"What a unique story!! Imagine a rich businesswoman from S Korea goes paragliding in her freetime to de-stress and gets caught in a tornado that blows her into N Korea. She gets rescued by a handsome army guy and his rag-tag troop of subordinates (belovedly nicknamed ""the ducklings""). The army captain ends up having to rescue her and protect her many times over, and she continuously stymies and befuddles this straight-laced, Joe Friday, ""Just the facts, Ma'am"", pragmatic officer.Americans: Get past the one-inch barriers called subtitles and allow the looooong, dramatic pauses to roll off your shoulders (there aren't as many as other K shows). The characters are so well written that you will love them all. Even the bad guy played by Man-Seok Oh is sooooo good at being bad (not to mention a cutie too). You get all you could ever want in an entertaining show with this one. Give it a whirl!!!",10
Best actors! best drama ever! Totally worth to watch! Only love for these people! ?????,10
"I don't watch korean series much! just randomly play this series on netflix, but this is exception. the more episode i seen .. i the more i am in love with the story line, characters of each role and many more.Hyu Bin & Sonye Jin you guys are rock! Congrats for making korean series worldwide via Netflix",10
"With this KDrama, we have a proven team: terrific writer, director, co-stars, and cast in a delightful love story but also lots of fun with the captain's squad, the village ajummas, a really evil bad guy, and jokes and teasing. These charms are combined with the longing for reunification that handles both North and South Koreans with love and respect. And both leads are at their most beautiful and talented. I swear Hyun Bin has never been better with that quiet, low voice, steady eyes, and sly smile taking every scene but never dominating. And, of course, Son Ye Jin is wondrous: beautiful, brilliant, touching, and hilarious. This series is a treat.",10
The best so far...Watched the whole 8 episode in one seating. Looking forward to next episodes thinking what would happen next!! The story line is unpredictable. They are all soooo good and beautiful. I love the funny scenes especially Se Ri's cuteness. Even Captain Ri's father scenes were so funny even they're not trying to.Please continue to produce more!!!,10
"I could write an essay about this drama, and we're only on episode ten. I'm a very critical person and it sucks because it's hard not to find fault in almost everything. I've been waiting for that dissapointing moment since episode one, and I'm baffled but still waiting. So far this show has literally been perfect, at least for me. The casting and acting have surpassed even my high expectations, the settings have been jaw dropping, the attention to detail when it comes to North Korea, even though it's not, it totally sells it that it is. You can tell the writer really took out all the guns on this one and tried to do her best work, and it shows. True, there's still six episodes so anything could happen, but it's hard to imagine how this show could miss the mark when it has done sooo well so far. Not one episode has disappointed, not one characters, not one scene, not one line delivery. I foresee this show becoming an all time best, and if it doesn't it'll be a crime. If you like K Dramas, I dont see how you can not enjoy this show even a little bit.",10
I am in the middle of this Kdrama and can't wait each week for the next episode. The stars Hyun Bin and Ye Jin Son are such good actors but the supporting cast is what I really enjoy. His soldiers and Jung hy un keep me laughing in every episode. It gets you through the tense moments. Such good character actors makes the whole series great. I highly recommend this show.,9
Can't give enough of it. I'm hoping they have a season 2 after ending the first season,10
"Recommend giving this KDrama a try. It's an entertaining combination of fluff, romance, drama, and political/police procedural. The cast and characters they portray are engaging and fun to watch (even the ""over the top"" villain). Looking forward to seeing how the story will resolve considering the complexity of the North/South Korea situation. Can't wait for to the next episodes to air on Netflix.",10
"One of the most well written and acted Korean dramas I have ever seen! The main couple have SO much chemistry and are such a good match despite their differences. There are multiple story lines and characters but they fit so well together. My favorite characters (besides the main couple) are the soldiers helping Captain Ri and the group of women from the military camp. So funny!The plot includes what life might be like in North Korea and it's fascinating! Power outages, hopping salespeople for when the train breaks down, strict dress/hair code, etc. They come from different worlds and it's interesting to see them each discover the other's world. Absolutely brilliant!",10
"So far, the best kd i have seen. No idle moment! Superb storyline, best & good looking actors esp Hyun Bin. He's a total package! From head to toe, ooh la la especially when he smiles, with those 2 cute dimples! OMG he's oozing with sex appeal.. Oh Hyun Bin, muy guapito .",10
"Writer Park Ji Eun has done it again. She has written a drama sure to be on the Top Ten Classics of KDrama list for a long time, right up there with her other mega-hit 'You Who Came from the Stars'. Brilliant casting, clever writing, side splitting comedy and a multitude of Easter eggs hidden everywhere put this right at the top of my top 10 Kdramas to date. This KDrama is as good as it gets It is what brought me to KDrama so many years ago. A must-see for all drama fans! Do not miss this one - a classic!",10
"The drama is really amazing and the leads and other characters are just perfect .For the very first time, i really find some real chemistry between main leads .
They look really cute together and i really wanna appreciate the writer of this drama.
Hyunbin and son yejin both are really really good actors as they make me fall in love with their chemistry every time i watch them together.
This drama and our leads really deserve awards . Hope to see this couple (hyunbin and sonyejin)again in some dramas and best of luck to crash landing on you team",10
"I'm in a very depressing situation at the moment. But, I tell you, viewers. This is something you wouldn't wanna miss seeing in the whole world. This drama is very inspiring! It makes you laugh, it makes cry. Like you can't just wait for the next episode. The main characters and supporting actors are AMAZING! Specially those 5 stooges. They are so funny! Thank you Directors and Producers, Cast for making this drama. IT'S THE BEST DRAMA I HAVE EVER WATCHED SINCE BOYS OVER FLOWERS.",10
I would definitely recommend this drama to all of my families and friends !,10
"So it's hard writing this review, as I'm not sure what K-dramas are meant to be... So anyone else new to this genre i'll summarise and you can decide for yourself.tonnes of unrealistic drama and gossip... think Home and Away if you are an Aussie or Britwoman gets constantly saved by guyset in North Korea and South Korea. Would love to know the research completed to show North Korea...they showcase the role of fate.. timelines and events seem a bit confused... did you take a pic of the couple twice, at different spots and both times think the other girl wasn't good enough? But at another time, on the same trip, you heard him play music and it changed you forever?Anywho, if you want a teenage drama type show that is easy viewing go for it or if you want to experience K -drama as a newbie like me",6
"Fabulous love story. Yes it has all of the cliches of a K-drama with a woman and man, first disliking each other than falling in love, an evil and dysfunctional. Chaebol family, a jealous girlfriend but it is set in a most uncliched location, North Korea. Lots of action, laughter, intrigue and thrills. Hyun Bin is to die for as the intelligent, handsome, upright North Korean soldier. Son Ye Jin is the whip smart, beautiful chaebol daughter. Watching them come together is a joy to watch.",10
This is my first kdrama and I have to say I absolutely love this show! I need 1000 more seasons of it,10
"If you have been watching this show, you have cried at all the touching moments many times. I really love this love show. The MC's are both really endearing. A superb love story with a little suspense. It's not really about being realistic, it's about relationships, and fate of two people meant to be together.",10
"Love love love this so far....The story is very well written and unique, having grow up in a communist country I was having flashbacks in a good way .. almost nostalgic.. from power cuts, to the school kids with the red scarfs around theirs necks .. too funnyThe cinematography and color grade of the film are outstanding. Setting (Sets) is outstanding tooThe cast ... all of the cast .. are absolutely outstanding. Hyun Bin and Son Ye-jin are the darlings of the k drama world and not without merit. kim jung hyun is so handsome , and the four guys playing Ri's subordinates are hilarious.
Actually this is the first korean romantic comedy I've seen where the humor is not lost in translation and I was able to get it.Netflix is up to the 13th episode now and I hope the ending is good because this far it's a total gem",10
"After sometime i am addicted to a K Drama again. This story is full of surprises and most of all, every episode has a beautiful twist and we wait with suspension. The main actors Hyun Bin and Son Jin are great with their performance and bring the real two characters to life. Cannot think of any two other actors to do these roles.
The story line which takes place in two countries make you feel like there are two dramas within one drama and therefore there is no time to get bored.
All the other supporting characters do a great contribution in bringing the story to life and i believe this is a great masterpiece and i don't have any complains about anything by far.
It has all the components (thriller, Romance, Comedy) in exact right composition. Highly Recommend",10
"All actors played very well. Especially the main actors are so cute together. The plot is not boring ,romantic and funny in all episode.",10
U need to watch this yourself. Simply amazing. From the story to the actors. The comedy is just enough to keep you smiling in between.,10
"It has many things going for it that will keep both men and women waiting for new episodes. The action, comedy, and drama all have perfect timing and the actors are all great at their craft. Sixteen episodes is not enough for this show!",10
"SPOILER FREE Review!I am not Korean, so may be I don't notice all the Korean cliches. But that said, the series is beautifully shot in Mongolia, Switzerland and South Korea. Most episodes, and characters are well written, and one would easily fall in love with them.
It's light hearted, no references to sex or nudity and a lot of laughter with some beautiful romantic scenes. Also, it shows North Koreans as humans, am sure they are!",10
"Ok, so this show is simply amazing. It has the perfect pace in the show. The reason i say this is because many K-Dramas tend to lag during the middle of the season to meet the 16 episodes they want to end at. Now this show literally doesn't lag it really all connects well and is intense and you just want too see the next episode NOW but have to wait a week on netflix for the next two episodes (its so hard to wait!). The two mains are absolutely perfect. The other actors in this show do so well too. You really get involved in the characters because they give a good background even to not main characters they at least give you something about them and you really care about the characters in this show and want too see more! Def a must watch! Do it watch it now!",10
"Another korean drama that give me the vibe that hard to gain from other dramas. The chemistry, the plot, the cast, the place, the way they act, sooooo gooooooddddd!!! I really love this dramaa. This drama is freaking good. It has the feeling that hard to move on... And also become lot of peoples' favourite. I just don't want this drama to end...will be really missing them, all of the cast.",10
I made an IMBD account just to write a review for this show. This is my favorite K-drama!!! The story line and the actors and everything about this show is brilliant. I was hooked 5 minutes into episode1!! There's never a boring moment. Love the mix of comedy and action and romance. I also like that each episode is well over an hour long. Easily rated 10/10!!!,10
"I am more of a 13 Days in Benghazi kind of guy but this Korean Soap opera has me hooked the main actress is stunning, you will melt for sure. There is enough action to keep a guy interested.",9
"This is my first time reviewing - and this is my first time watching Korean drama TV show - something I never thought I would enjoy having grown up in Hollywood, but I am Super impressed! The 4 main characters are perfect in their roles, and the supporting actors were great! I love the build up from the first episode all the way to the end. It has cute interactions as well as heartbreaking ones, and just an overall enjoyable drama in Korean. I started watching other Korean tv shows but none of them are as well made as this one, I highly recommend this if it's your first time watching korean drama and hope you enjoy it as much as I did!The story is about a South Korean smart lady boss who happens to come from a wealthy family and meets a North Korean soldier after accidentally being swept away in a hurricane. Both actors were great in their roles, although I find the female actor Son ye jin a better actor, the male actor Hyun Bin is quite handsome and cute in his role. The supporting actors are all quite good and thought the director did a good job - especially with the build up of the story. Hope to see this group of actors again whether in a second season, or in another tv show. Very well done!! Love the show!!",10
Wish this drama was longer. Funny and cute. Really engages the audience to finish each episode,10
"The characters and storyline was superb! Congratulations to everyone on the CLOY team!
If you're familiar of KDramas this is one of the best to watch and if you're new to it this will get you hooked!",10
"What can I say about Crash Landing on You that hasn't been said already? For starters this drama belongs to the Premier Division of k drama IMO, in line with Secret Garden, You Who Came From the Stars, Legend of the Blue Sea. Not entirely coincidental these dramas were aided by respectively the same actor, Hyun Bin, and the same screen writer, Park Ji Eun. The question remains: what's so good about it? I think it is the right mix of story, actors & music.The StoryCrash Landing on You combines many proven genres that capture a worldwide audience from the start: action, romance, comedy, drama, tragedy, business, rags & riches. Moreover it is meticulously written according to the golden rules of screen writing:
1. Use the time of your audience in such a way that they will not feel their time was wasted
2. Give people at least one character to root for
3. Every character should want something, even if it is only a glass of water
4. Every minute must either reveal more of a character or advance the action
5. Start as close to the end as possible
6. Be a sadist. No matter how sweet your characters, make awful things happen to them to show what they are made of
7. Don't try to please the whole world, this only weakens your storyline
8. Give your audience as much information as possible in order to stay hooked.
The storytelling is also rock solid: boy meets girl - they get into trouble - things go from bad to worse - there is a closure but at the same time it keeps us from knowing if new developments are good or bad, hoping for a sequel.The ActorsEven well written stories are made or broken by the cast. In this case the acting of each and everyone was on point. I can't imagine any other actor playing the lead than Hyun Bin (the stern and sturdy North Korean army officer Ri Jung Hyuk) and Son Ye Jin (the sophisticated South Korean chaebol heiress Yoon Se Ri). Also the supporting cast did a great job, with honorable mentions for Yang Kyung Won (sergeant Pyo Chi Su who speaks North Korean to a T according to North Korean defector Kang Nara) and Bang Eun Jin playing the emotionally scarred mother of Se Ri.The MusicSo, we've got our story and the right actors, but the soundtrack is the cherry on top. No surprise this soundtrack leads the Top 10 of most downloaded OST's of ALL TIME at the moment I'm writing this review.RewatchSometimes I can forget a story as soon as the clue has been reached, but I think I will definitely rewatch this drama. There are many layers in the episodes that deserve a re-run.VerdictOverall, if you haven't seen this already, go watch it, and get in line with others who are longing for The Sequel.",9
"""If you give up on waiting, the pain of loss will kill you. That's why I wait."" -Captain Ri.Most people who have watched the entire series, love CLOY, which is one of KDrama's finest series, for some of the following points:1. The writer, Park Ji-eun, who also gave us ""You Who Came from the Star"" is one of the best, knowing how to balance drama, comedy, themes, and closure while keeping her audience intrigued and in love with her characters. The director, Lee Jeong-hyo, who has worked on many series and movies, kept everything focused and carefully paced so that the series steadily evolved each week.2. The cast is one of the best I've seen with immensely beautiful and talented leads, warm, hilarious village ajummas, and Capt. Ri's delightful squad, dubbed ""the ducklings""-all of whom became a family for one another and for the viewers.3. Themes varying from the pain of losing family, being abandoned and becoming a street orphan all the way to the belief in a Zen appreciation for patience and waiting, also kindness, protection, sacrifice, and unconditional love. The themes drive the plot, and the cast brought everything to life, making us impatient for each weekend to finally roll around so we can see what happens next to our beloved characters, whether love, laughter, danger and heartbreak, we got on that train with them.4. A great story that keeps the reader interested, a love story whose premise was there from the beginning and revealed brilliantly in the steady epilogues. But also the comedy of the sidekick-and the horror of the bad guy consumed with envy and jealousy that destroys innocence and beauty, making this the classical struggle between good and evil embraced by every generation since time.5. The touching, beautiful OST, which many fans have downloaded. The piano piece ""Song for My Brother"" leaves me in tears every time.6. A wealthy, beautiful but hurt woman who learns to love herself as well as others, who can be hilarious and sassy, yet who finds strength in loving and protecting the most amazing man-Capt. Ri.7. A beautiful man, a pianist who becomes an army officer, a quiet philosopher and tomato plant caretaker with a ""low voice""-the kindest man I believe I've ever seen in any narrative-who adores the hurt woman, knows who she is, finds her, protects her, and loves her no matter what evil, what danger threatens them. Yes, he sounds too good to be true. . . . .but he's not. The whole world is in love with Capt. Ri because Hyun Bin developed him and made us believe that such a man can exist.",10
I have watched a few Korean dramas in the past and they have been fine. This one however is endearing and well put together. The main actors have good chemistry and do a splendid job. The supporting actors are great too and well defined too. This is storytelling at its best. Watched every episode hoping for more. Hoping there's a season 2 because I'll really miss this series. Well done and thanks Netflix!,9
Must watch k-drama of 2020.Storyline of drama is fabulous and all the character fits in their role . Its a must watch k-drama and one of my best k-drama,10
"Just watch it. It's got beautiful cinematography, great chemistry between all the characters, tender and funny moments, as well as commentaries on both N and S Korean societies. So good.",10
""" Crash landing on you "" was an excellent melodrama with a sweet romance.The first part of the drama was amazing. Sure, the first episode was a bit of a mess, as they were trying to fit in every back story in order to lead us to the big even of the female lead getting into North Korea by accident. And while we're at it, I would have liked if they had given a more in depth presentation of the main character's background and her relationship with her family, as the latter was a big part of her life and personality and a lot of twists were based on that rocky relationship.That said, the part where the leading lady was living in North Korea was really good. I don't know if the presentation of the country was accurate, but the one they gave us worked for the story. The romance had also a nice pace and it had enough intense and lovable moments. Yes, some of them were cheesy, but they were enjoyable. The side characters were adorable and they added a comedy element to the plot. The male lead had some funny aspects as well.Now, for the second part, it wasn't as good as the first part, but it was enjoyable. It had enough action and thriller to keep things interesting, and the side characters were simply pure entertainment. The second couple had some time to shine during the second part too, however, their ending was really disappointing, as it was rushed and not properly done.Finally, the settings and costumes were pretty good and the soundtrack perfect. The performances were really good from all the actors and actresses (this one was actually the only drama other than secret garden where I enjoyed the male lead, hopefully it won't be the last).So, overall, eight out of ten.",8
"I always love to watch KDrama. It has been awhile since I last watched one with Hyun Bin as the main character.. I so love him ever since the Secret Garden days.. Crash Landing on You has a perfectly unique storyline, a love story through the barricades of the North and South. Bravo!",10
"This is a top K show that we have watched in the past several years that fills your heart with joy, hope and humanity in each episode. It shows the humanity in all echelons of society, from poor to rich, from communist to capitalists, from military to playboy. The chemistry is incredible, the emotions are real, and the casting is perfect. Watching the show brings you the joy of being alive. Hats off to the director and entire team.",10
I never thought I would like it but it was an amazing series.,10
"Hyun Bin is a great actor. His onscreen chemistry with son yejin is amazing. Highly recommend. It is funny, touching,",10
"If you are new to K Drama , you wouldn't understand the reference , however it is a very good show to watch. I started watching these just last year ( damn, they are addictive ) , but I have noticed they are becoming far more mature and less Cinderella like, which explains why a 50+ year old guy like me can watch them. A must watch.",10

"This was my first Korean drama to watch, so I was not sure what to expect, as I watched it because Netflix kept suggesting it to me. The minute I started watching, though, I couldn't stop and binged on the episodes available till that date (13 episodes then!). The chemistry between the leads is amazing, and their acting beyond fantastic. As for the 'side' characters, for me they were an integral part of the series and not 'side' at all. On the contrary, they gave life to the story, especially the North Korean soldiers (the friends of Jeong-Hyeok), whether with their funny side or humane side. Most important though was the beautiful love story between Se-ri and Jeong-Hyeok, which made the first drastically change in character and the second go the extra mile and do what seems impossible to protect his love... let alone the love gestures he so silently offers to Se-ri (especially those shown in the last few episodes). All in all, it is well worth watching and rewatching many times. Definitely one of my all-time favs.",10
"Wonderful story, beautifully directed, brilliant writing, and incredible film locations and scenery in every episode. Hyun Bin and Son Ye Jin were exceptional in their performance together. Their characters Ri Jung Hyuk and Yoon Se Ri coupled with their acting made for one emotionally compelling, heartwarming love story. Similarly, the story would not have been as powerful if it were not for the entire cast: they were all amazing! Bravo to this fabulous production! Netflix does it again with their outstanding Original K-Drama! Cheers to a fantastic viewing selection! Loved it!",10
"The main couple was so fluid together, that when the series was over, I Couldn't really watch another rom-com because I missed Ser-Ri and Captain Ri. For a whole day I found myself simply staring out and catching myself thinking about the ending. A love beyond borders. Honestly, the entire cast was perfect. I don't give out 10 stars easy. The whole cast has me searching for their other acting projects. I was already familiar with both main characters though. Watch this show!! You won't be disappointed! It's on Netflix.",10
"The last time i saw the full episode of KD was Whats wrong with Secretary Kim but this one made me fall in love with KD again. Every episode is full of twist and turns. The interesting part is how the story connects every little detail of an issue. The epilogue, the story about how destiny brought them together. It is such a wonderful story and yes just finished it with shedding a lot of tears.",10
"If you have been frustrated by all the recent K-dramas that have been marketed as ""romance"" films just because they include some romantic content, I am pleased to report that this one is the genuine article. Yes, the plot is peppered with lots of suspense, action & comedy as well, but those elements always remain peripheral to the unfolding love story.Aside from being technically polished, this show also boasts a great (if understated) script and cast who were respectively endearing or despicable (depending on their roles). I also loved the layered backstories, deep friendships and various inter-dynamics among the characters. Plus, despite some bittersweet moments, the unconventional ending was happy and hopeful.And although this IS a romance film, I just have to say: THE COMEDY!!! Unlike many K-dramas which might get a chuckle from me with slapstick moments or exaggerated expressions, the humor in this show comes from hilarious culture-related misunderstandings, misinterpretations, shocks and awkwardness that left me in stitches. I nearly woke my kids up a few times because I couldn't stop laughing! And that gaming scene with the ""Memories of the Alhambra"" Easter egg nearly killed me. :DOf course there were some weak points. In particular, I thought many of the hand-to-hand combat scenes seemed a bit unrealistic and looked too rehearsed. There were also a number of scenes that were overly melodramatic, poorly executed or just outright impossible (the tandem paragliding scene, for example). But considering that this show is obviously meant to be a departure from reality, I can't really count these issues as faults. No film can do everything perfectly, right?In summary, if you like K-drama, are looking for a romance story that will make you laugh out loud, cry a little, and you don't mind having to continually suspend your disbelief, you should give this one a try. Highly recommended!ROMANCE RATING: 8.5/10
I thought Hyun Bin & Son YeJin had believable chemistry and they shared 5+ kiss scenes (very generous by K-drama standards!) The more serious kisses were also quite long, and fell somewhere between PG-13 & NC-17 for passion level. To be totally honest, I felt both Hyun Bin & Son YeJin's performances in this film were a bit too understated for my personal taste, but they still delivered when it came to the romantic parts, so it's all good! :)",9
I strongly recommend all of you to watch this Korean drama,10
"I've watched several KDramas now, most with a historical connection. This one takes place in the present, but focuses on a Romance and resulting conflicts between South and North Korea. There are tender moments, laugh out loud scenes and action sequences. The soundtrack (available on Amazon Music) has many haunting pieces that add a lot to the mood of the series. It is addicting",10
"This is simply the most thoroughly enjoyable series I have seen on TV for years in any language. The comedy the romance and the drama are all successfully blended. Love the ongoing comedy about the differences between North and South Korea - all freshly done and spot on. Neither side is spared or treated unfairly. The farewells are heartbreaking and the romantic scenes are unforgettable. Many memorable scenes from the motorcycle rescue to his parents house. And the tightly constructed exciting story amazingly leaves no holes and has no red herrings while making use of the unique divide that exists in the peninsula. The Korean country side is idyllic and and so is the magical beauty of Switzerland.Hyun Bin is ideal as the North Korean soldier - can't think of another actor who could have been better and he has some truly standout heroic rescue and romantic scenes. Son Ye Jin is sweet and pretty and makes her character likeable and sympathetic - not annoying at all. Her range is impressive. The supporting characters are sympathetic especially the scoundrel Gu with a heart and seemingly cold fiance Seo Dan. The cute bunch of N Korean soldiers are all endearing and the evil and greed in the S Korean family members is painfully familiar.Hollywood hasn't been able to come up with anything fictional of this standard. The best series are based on true events and people like Narcos. Hollywood series have been dominated by worthy but depressing subjects like rape, suicide and racial injusticeYou will laugh cry and just be completely captivated. I wonder how they can ever top this.",10
"On one of my nights of sleepless not filtering in and allowing me to catch some Zzzz'z I thought I would take ROKU and wake up Netflix. Now I know I am an old goat of nearly 68, when I layed eyes on Ye-jin Son, the Yoon Se-Ri character, I was smitten. Just a most gorgeous woman in these days pop creations bombarding us from all sides, it takes me to need a foreign movie to capture me and hold my attention for over 4 to 5 hours straight! I told my wife that she needed to watch Crash Landing On You. It is in Korean, but subtitles are well easy to read. This movie offers it all. Greedy siblings, a corrupt N Korean officer and some FANTASTIC scores being played. Well as luck would have it, I told my wife all I required her to watch was the first episode. Today was an off day for her and we took in 6 episodes. I am peppered with questions, and there is a new, rabid fan in our home. Too boot, the acting is much better than the pinheads we are used to in the states. Do yourself a favor. Take the one episode trick test and I guarantee you'll be hooked.",10
"This was my first K-drama and it definitely won't be the last after watching this (hopefully they're all as amazing as this was).After the first episode I was hooked and after each episode I was desperate for the next one. All the characters are played perfectly and have real character development, so as viewers we're invested in them all, unlike other TV shows where its solely focused on the main two characters.This show had me laughing out loud and crying more than any other show and is a much watch for all who are after a bit of comedy and romance. Bit of eye candy with Hyun Bin too, so bonus!",10
"The romance, comedy and action bits are just perfect! I downloaded the soundtracks, every song makes my heart aches. I have seen quite a few of KDs, so far RiRi couple has the best chemistry!",10
"It has a very intriguing concept for a drama. The leads are top notch actors with great chemistry. The cinematography is splendid, leaves you in awe all the time. I just didn't like that they have not so interesting second leads and supporting actors and the ost are just played at almost end.",8
"Very enjoyable series. Entertaining, romantic and moving. At times also funny. Great performances by lovely leading stars.",10
"Sometimes the wrong train takes you to the right station. It was like that for me, too. I accidentally clicked on this drama on Netflix and just ended watching all the episodes. I am not a K-drama fan, tho. However, this drama leaves me with such an indescribable feeling. I was laughing, crying, thrilling, experiencing lots of emotions. I didn't know anything about North Korean and doubt it to be real until I watched this, I googled the information about the relationship between NK and SK, I saw how a North Koreans react to this drama. Wow, they actually well researched, the plot was excellent, the cinematography was so amazing, and don't forget the after credit scenes. Thanks to all cast, their chemistry was beyond everything. Usually, I would find some missing details after rewatching the movie/series. But this drama is exceptional, what I found was perfection. A must watch in 2020.",10
"""Even if it breaks my heart because it's a dream that can't come true, I'd like to sincerely dream of the future.""I finished this Drama an hour ago and I am still just sitting here, not knowing what to do,...or to write, for that matter.
I am floored. My heart aches. I am happy and sad and amazed and grateful to have been able to watch this masterpiece. I honestly don't know where to begin. My heart is so full.""Crash Landing On You"" is a master class in screenwriting. The pacing, the revelations through flashbacks and unlinear storytelling, the perfect balance between tragedy, romance and humor,...and God, the characters!How is it possible to make each and every character of such a big ensemble so complex, relatable and loveable? I was so attached to every single character, that at some point I basically cried through entire episodes, because even when there were happy scenes, I kept thinking that things would probably not stay like that for all my poor babies. At any given time, while watching CLOY, I just had to think of the whole South Korea - North Korea predicament that they are all in and the tears started flowing.The scenes between Jung Hyuk and Se Ri are so raw and real that I often cried, as well. They say crying doesn't necessarily mean you're sad, it just means you are overwhelmed with emotion - no matter which emotion. And that's exactly how I felt. I was so overwhelmed that I cried when it was sad, romantic and funny.I cried buckets and buckets of tears but I also laughed so hard that my stomach was sore the next day. There are so many funny moments in both, North and South Korea, but I think my favorite was Se Ri's department store opening. I almost died laughing.As an aspiring screenwriter and filmmaker, I am deeply humbled by the masterful stroytelling and breathtaking cinematography. There are so many gorgeous settings, such as all the snow scenes, the night of the train break-down and all the scenes in Switzerland.I am Swiss and I've never seen Switzerland portrayed so beautifully. It made me fall in love with my own country, again. It was strange to see the tram I take every week in a K-Drama. It was strange to see the place I spent vacations as a child. It was strange to see the sights I walk past every day, and have them shown in a new light, looking at them through the eyes of these characters to whom Switzerland represents happiness and their own little paradise. Somehow, seeing some of these incredibly emotional scenes against the Swiss backdrop, made them even more emotional for me.I can't mention the Switzerland scenes without mentioning how perfect the OST is, especially ""The Song For My Brother"", ""Flower"", ""Sunset, ""Here I Am Again"", ""The Hill of Yearning"" and ""Photo of My Mind"", which are the perfect musical expression of the Drama's atmosphere and emotions.Last but not least, the acting is brilliant! I've loved Hyun Bin ever since ""A Millionaire's First Love"", and his on-screen chemistry with Son Ye Jin is out of this world. I am also very happy to have been introduced to Kim Jung Hyun, Lee Shin Young and Seo Ji Hye through this Drama.This drama touched the deepest parts of my soul and will forever stay with me!",10
"I finally finished it, 16 episodes and more than 20 hours of total running time. I'm not a fan of Korean Telenovelas, but I decided to give this one a try because of all the hype and also I thought that anything related to North Korea should be interesting.And it turned out to be quite an amazing series. In fact the hardest thing I had to do was resist watching the next episode because once you start watching it, it's pretty hard to stop.I think the North Korean setting is what makes this series unique and great, and also what kept me going thru some cheesy scenes (this is, after all, a Soap Opera). The setting bought the viewers to an exotic, new place with strange customs, and at the same time allowed the ""Fish Out of Water"" Plot Device on both sides of Korea (a minor spoiler there).Aside from that the series is also very well made in terms of Script and Plot Twists. It initially starts out as a Romantic Comedy with incredibly witty, you-will-fall-out-of-your-chair-laughing dialogue, and eventually evolves into a Soap Opera Thriller towards the middle of the season with clever Cliffhangers at the end of each Episode.The pacing is fast, there are always a lot of things happening onscreen, and the Cinematography is amazing, especially the scenes in Switzerland which made the place almost look like heaven.My only reservation is that is a bit cheesy at times as I mentioned earlier, and also a bit too wholesome for me, which made it feel a bit too unreal at times. I mean, no-tongue kisses, really?And no sex, despite all those gorgeous people sleeping around in each other's apartments? I think they just wanted the series to be as acceptable for as wide an audience as possible.Despite that, overall I would say that this is no ordinary series, it is much better than much of what I have seen on Netflix so far. I think it is an Instant Classic, a Masterpiece that must be seen. Truly outstanding.",10
"What a wonderful rollercoaster of a show! You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll even laugh and cry!. Beautifully written - great story and a great cast. Son Ye-jin stands out as the incredible lead as does Hyun Bin as the almost Jack Bauer esq. hero. In fact, the series has a bit of a 24 feel to it for some reason - but one with a lot of heart. The contrast between North and South Korea is like chalk and cheese, but also eye-opening to life in the North and I think they treated it very respectfully. Can't recommend it enough - don't let the subtitles put you off!",10
I swear i need season 2 . I cant get enough with 1season only . I wanna see their twin girls . I want some make love scenes ... please .,10
"Breathless during the whole series!
Probably one of the greatest Love Stories I've ever seen in my life!
So powerful, so innocent, so highly emotional!
Full of the differences between the two different states, which made it so engaging!
I am in love with this series!
The two actors were both so beautiful and great in acting, having high chemistry between them. Probably one of the best couples I've seen in TV series!
I am also in love with Hyun Bin! :)",10
"I was sceptical to watch it when I read the description, but I gave it a go. I'm glad I did, it's funny, romantic, lots of drama and you get teary. 9/10
I love the main characters and especially Hyun Bin is handsome ?? .I wish for a season 2 next year ??. Please Netflix we want to see a season 2 in 2021",9
"Started off really well but it dragged out with very lazy ending (basically the last 7 episodes even), many unnecessary scenes. Couldn't get myself to be touched in the last episodes because of these tired repeated clichés and goodbyes. Plus they killed the best character and seodan redemption arc. Absolutely ridiculous.",4
A beautiful love story with fabulous lead stars. Such a lovely series. Really well done. Brilliant.,10
"If you have forgotten how it feels to believe in Love, you'll be reminded.",10
"Watch out you will be addicted to the drama. Yesterday I watched the last episode and I can't get over it. Love the story, characters everything ^^.
The main actors has great chemistry <3 I am hoping for season 2.
You must watch this drama!!!",10
"I really enjoy the language too!
The reality on N Korea is off, but that does not spoil the overall experience.",9
"Lets get to the point, this series destroyed my heart, i need to re wire. It didn't matter whether the scene was happy or sad, i wad just crying. I never felt this attached and this emotional over any other kdrama i can say this one wasn't typical teenage type drama but it was one that adults also can relate with. It wasn't one girl many boy or one amazing boy with a girl less than him, It was forbidden love, something u can't reach not because of one side of love but because of the political situation. Aaaaah I can't even say how much i loved it. ( still crying )",10
"My most unforgettable kdrama series. I love each and every episode. The soundtrack fits to every scenes. It is well-played and portrays strongly each and every emotions and feelings of the characters. Amazing plot which is far best than ""Romeo and Juliet"" romance. I never expected this kdrama being out of the ordinary melodrama and tragic plot. This is so balance. Anyone who will watch this series will not be left heartbroken but will feel hopeful and loved. It feels so good watching it.",10
"I'm a sucker for romance, and this k-drama got me so hooked it's Insane.It can be a little corny sometimes with the typical K-drama, but that is also the charming part if you can embrace it.Sarangui Boolshichak is filmed in an different way with more of a non-sexual aspect. which i think it makes this Sarangui Boolshichak more beautiful.
It was humors, romantic, nail biting and intrigued of what will happen next.
The story is beautiful and the typical knight in shining armor never gets old.the chemistry is very good between the main characters.
I loved hyun-bin. and son ye-jin made a huge impact in the emotions part.Im gonna watch this another time with my girlfriend.",10
Really engaging and fun to watchGive it a chance9/10,9
"I only watched a few Korean drama movies and this is my first Korean Drama series but I enjoyed it a lot that I'm watching it for the second time. The cast, the action, comedy and drama, the soundtrack, the sceneries are all so good! It's an emotional rollercoaster ride!",10
"I've never, ever watched a Korean show and this show just shook me to the core! The plot is out-of-this-world, truly original, and the acting is amazing!!!! I felt every feeling, I laughed, I cries and I can't get enough of it! It's way better than any Hollywood production. Just do yourself a favour and watch it!!!!",10
"Kind of but not quite a Romeo and Juliet story, mixed with fantasy, satire, comedy, tragedy, murder, mystery, tension, wistfulness, and dramatic, fateful and improbable but entirely romantic coincidences; with observations on politics, societies, character, and allusions to Hollywood and other movies, eg., Pretty Woman, The Wizard of Oz.Characters and pretensions that are universal; this series is for the world. The 'hero' is the romance the captivating characters create (even the villains).Despite being subtitled (beautifully rendered), the series is entrancing. Probably even better if you understand Korean.Ten stars. Bravo.",10
"Worth to watch if you need something light and romantic
Unforgettable drama with good acting.",8
"At first I'm curious to what the fuss is all about with CLOY and now that I've watched it I'm honestly just dumbfounded. I've never cried like this on kdramas since Goblin, only this time it's almost every ep ?? The plot, acting/cast, and OST are all 10/10-not to mention the overall superb cinematography ??CLOY is now the second-highest rated kdrama on television history, beating Reply 1988 and Goblin (Well-deserved imho ????) No doubt CLOY would win numerous awards at Baeksang Arts Awards (which is like the Emmys of Korea)",10
"For a KD to portray and pull off the North Korean culture and dialect deserves an award in itself. So many dramas fail to capture the depiction of North Korea in the positive sense of things, but this KD does everything in its power to show both the good and bad side of the country including the value of belonging in a community. The character development of both leads and supporting cast was also incredible to watch given no one outshone one another, and each character (whether their part was big or small) had an equal opportunity to tell their life story. Moreover, to unite the two Koreas by plotting a developing romance between two people with completely opposite lives and mantra was a genius idea. The energy and undeniable chemistry you felt from the screen b/w the two leads is honestly unmatched, and the fact that I cried in almost every episode goes to show how big of an impact most of the scenes had on me to feel the way I did.",10
"The Best K Series I've seen to date I cant even stress enough how perfect the Plot, Storyline, Cinematography,Script and Set Design its like your watching a movie every episode..Aside from the visuals the Cast is on point their character build up, from.the smallest role made a vital part of the story. Every actors and actresses in this series will make you love them as if you are with them, you will laugh, cry, mad, frustrated, root and fall in love with them.. their acting skills will hypnotized you to their realm.The script will be embedded to your heart and will be immortalize as one of the great love story of all time.salute to the writerSon Ye Jin and Hyun Bin chemistry described as being off the chart is an understatement. Their acting as if its real. I never shipped a couple this much hope they will find love with each otherLet me say their OST alone is a masterpiece how clever it was perfectly place in every scene how it will add to the pain and the happiness. I dont understand the lyrics but damn feels and chills everytime.Never in my existence did I cry for a movie or series unless there is an animal involve in it. But watching CLOY...I cried river of tears. i cant even understand myself whyI know you might be hesitant to watch it because of how long every episode is but trust me you will be begging for more.It is once in a life time that we can enjoy this kind of masterpiece so give yourself a treat
100/10PS.: This series also tackles about depression and suicide which is very timely and relevant and you will learn that one's love sometime can save a life not by coincidence but with fate",10
I am deeply impressed by the way they have portray their country and make in such a sophisticated way that no one can go without appreciating after watching a very inspirational drama. It fulfills all the parameter of a family season which we can watch with our whole family including children.,10
Thank you. I will have this serie in my heart to the rest of my live.,10
"It has been several weeks since I watched the last episode of Crash Landing on You and I am utterly shocked by how much I miss these characters. And not just the main characters whose chemistry was magical but all the supporting cast as well. They lent a depth and breadth to this tale--the good guys were endearing and the bad guys were classic. Caution: You will have to suspend judgement about a few circumstances but if you ever read Peter Pan, you will easily want to believe they can fly. Personal note: I started watched K-D's because I am 75 years old and wanted to keep my mind sharp by reading subtitles. I don't know if my mind is sharper but my heart is warmer thanks to this wonderful series.",10
"Watched almost all korean drama and this will remain number 1 for me. All of family members age ranging 17-65 love this drama as well. See it for yourself and for sure ull love it as wellACTORS :main leads Hyun bin and Son Ye jin they have the skills and charisma to portray the role they played,they were the right actors to play the role they did. All the supporting cast are well chosen and also did a good job potraying each or their roleBEST CINEMATOGRAPY AND AWESOME SOUNDTRACKSDIRECTOR ,WRITER , Present it in a concise way with mind blowing scenes and heart fluttering moments .After finishing this drama . Im not watching anything not until 6 mos elapsed ,cause I cant move one .",10
"This show is the only K-drama that could suck me in into the Hallyu (Korean wave). The story is amazingly compelling and stays with you long after you've finished watching, the main lead has incredible chemistry, the cast is solid and gives strong performance, and the settings (particularly the North Korean ones) are so detailed and well-illustrated. I cried, laughed, and swooned throughout the entire 16 episodes. Would definitely recommend watching!",10
I had never watched a K-drama before but at the insistence of Netflix I started it and am I ever glad I did. This is a love story that manages to be sweet and funny and action filled and touching with an incredible balance! I have watched it too many times to count already and can see myself viewing it many more times. In this age of pandemics and bad news this is soothing and wonderful for the soul,10
"I opened this account just to be able to let future kdrama viewers know that this drama will get you hook just after one episode! The chemistry between the 2 lead stars, Hyun Bin & Son Ye Jin is amazing! This drama tops The Notebook for me. Check it out, you will not regret it.",10
"Excellent cast, acting and sound track! I have never watched a drama series that could make me cry out loud, laugh out loud and suffer withdrawal symptoms afterwards.",10
"This is probably my MOST FAVORITE KDrama! Lead actors are so freaking amazing! Kilig (Filipino slang for romantic excitement) overload Super Love Hyun Bin! This man CAN REALLY ACT! I am so impressed of his performance! Ye-jin is great too! There's definitely undeniably chemistry between them, love blossoms seem very true :DThis is just simply amazing, i will watch it more once that's for sure!",10
"The first half is unique and enthralling, an engaging and relatively realistic take on life in North Korea. However, I felt that the second half was an unrealistic portrayal of South Korea. What started off a Romeo + Juliet love story in an authentic Korean setting dissolved into an idealized political argument. The story is cute and the characters are lovable (which should be all that matters). But a small part of me feels that the show, which had such promise, fell into old traps and stooped closer to the manipulating behaviour of the North.",8
"North Korea here is a bucolic slightly backwards place, no internet or smart phones, with good hearted folk. Oh sure some baddies to add some tension but the writers dig deep into the K-Drama trope drawer.",5
"This is my favorite Kdrama so far and I've watched so many of them. Seriously so good! Words can't explain how much I love this show; I watched it twice in a week! partly because of the coronavirus quarantine... I didn't get bored the 2nd time and I saw some details I missed the first time! Anyway I hope there's a season 2, I want to see them have babies- twins! and live a long happy life together with gray hair!",10
Ight so just finished dis and it's good. Y'all should watch it. According to most North Korean people who defected its pretty accurate except for some parts.,10
Stories laid behind each scene are set up based on unrealistic belief of the S.Korean towards the North one. K dramas are well known for their Romanticism overlapped with impractically platonic love. The characters are so done with their roles but the fact that it doesn't help anything! This is just a stereotypical Korean film...,1
"I have no experience of k-dramas, this is my first time watching one. But this show, wooow. So many emotions happiness, sadness, drama, longing, excitement. I laughed I cried and couldn't help but feel it with my heart. Even though the episodes are long it's not enough. Loved every second of it",10
"This is my first k-drama series, and I just loved it from every perspective. The background score, acting, story and direction all falls in perfect place. I don't think it can get any better than this !",10
"To be honest, for me Crash Landing On You is the best kdrama ever. I love every episode and it is the first kdrama that I attracted to. Hyun Bin(Ri Jeong Hyeok) and Son Ye Jin(Yon Seri) are the perfect couple and both of them really fit in this drama. I don't know what to say anymore, but I really love this kdrama. Finally, I hope to see season 2 of Crash Landing On You especially I hope the the director will fulfill the viewer's wish that this drama will have season 2. Thank you for the best kdrama",9
I would have given this one 10 stars because I enjoyed this very much right up until the end. The ending imho was simply unsatisfying and left a somewhat bitter taste in its wake. Pity.,7
"I'd never wanted to start watching Korea drama, until this series came out on Netflix. I started watching these series since ppl have been raving about it. And they were right, it's really good! I have been rewatching for about 4 times and loving every episode! It's really hard to move on from this drama. Simply because of the main casts, Hyun Bin and So Ye-jin, they played it so well!! Hope there will be another K-drama with these 2 adorable persons on it.",10
"It's my first time watching a Korean drama but it has me wondering if I need to go to North Korea to meet someone like him :D
Loved every second of this amazing show.",10
"I watched this at the time it was showing. I loved the acting, the cast made informed decisions and executed their role perfectly, the funny parts were quite funny and the serious parts were so very well done. I was always inexplicably happy after watching this. It was sweet and. had the right amount of romance + duty.",10
"It is totally overhyped as people are saying this is the best K-drama they have seen in years.Have people gone mad or what ??
The story has absolutely no strength in this but the characters and the comedy atleast make it for a sweet good rom-com upto Episode 9 only.Consider that episde as an ending to the series.After that episode the series totally goes off the rails trying to include action and deus-ex machinas and irrational acts of characters.The series is just forcefully dragged beyond episode 9.The finale episode is ultimate cheese and fan service episode which is painfully long for 2 hours.I am first time K-drama watcher and I am really worried that if this is the standard for the K- drama fans to consider something as best ??",6
"Crash Landing on you places its viewers in an emotional roller coaster and makes its viewers feel vivid emotions to bliss, anger and sadness. It adds its underlying political aspect as well, by promoting the union of the two Koreas just like the union of the main protagonists.",10
"I watched it twice and enjoyed a lot, comedy scenes and the pure love and the situation of North Korea made me think and some how compare wit the country I live. Hyun Bin is one of my favorite stars from long time ago and I just become eager to watch the drama because of him but I found that Son Ye JIN is also marvelous. I f you watch it, you will enjoy it so much.",10
I just love all the characters and cast.The story is also nicely written and directed amazingly.Must watch.,10
"I enjoy ""Crash landing on you"" a lot. We have been tired with the sucks in real life, so for me watching movie is relaxing hobby, and this movie is definitly for that purpose. It brings some funny moments with rural neighbors, soldiers, friends, daily life of a mystery land - North Korea.
Strongly recommend!",10
"This is a korean drama that I am glad i saved to watch whilst we are globally in lockdown. I know it will be good as I have seen some post in social media and some online review so I already have some expecations.Usually when you have good expectation you tend to be a bit disappointed when you didnt meet it. But this one did not disappoint one bit.
Characters in this drama are perfectly chosen. HYun Bin is dashing both in his military and civilian clothes. my gosh he is a delight to watch in all angles. His cold reaction is both endearing and manly. Son ye jin is a strong street wise woman that doesnt just cry and get scared in the corner. They have a very good chemistry that you would want to be put to reality. This is not a teen comedy drama nor any other drama that is over the top. This drama is a an adult kind of love that attraction started from the very first episode and Yoon Se ri has said that in a comedic way from the beginning. The risks they take to save each others lives prove the love they have for each other. The thoughtfullness that one has for each other is remarkable. You feel their pain and happiness and the difficulties they face for not being allowed to be together just because they are in a conflicting nation. The amount of times they say their goodbyes are all so painful that you would think it would always be their last time to see each other.
The supporting characters hyun Bin subordinates played their part really well. They show how a north korean would react to the many things that are just ordinary in SK but lacked in NK. The women villagers are overpowering in the beginning but it shows that the people in NK are just normal human being capable of showing emotions doing their day to day lives in a small village. I have done some researched after watching this drama and it says the lifestyle by the north korean depicted in this drama is true to what is happening in there and I would like believe that.
There are no loose end on this drama. Everything is very well explained as to what, how, why something happen. Which is what i love on korean drama. You will not have the urge to throw a glass to the Television screen in frustration which we sometimes feel in some hollywood dramas.
The writer is very clever that no one among the main characters ended with defection from each others country. They subtly choose Switzerland as a neutral country to stay. Brilliant!",10
"This is a dramedy with absurd premisses. Very different from almost everything else we have seen, even though we watch our share of Korean movies and shows. The story is good and you'd be tempted to binge. But what makes this show shine are the great actors - we have laughed so much, cried so much, it is a rare gem.A bit of the acting is too much, as should be expected, and a few characters are quite one-dimensional. But it all comes together exceptionally well. Strong recommendation, especially good to escape the covid-19 crisis and all; immerse in this and fall in love with both main actors and their supporting cast.",8
"I am from Holland and have watched the series on Netflix. So much better than any romance film or series, and I have seen a lot of them over the decades of my years.",10
"This drama is interesting as much of it is in North Korea. The North Korean accent is well done, the living style is well done, the North Korean government is also well done.However many parts of the drama are unrealistic:
-Son Ye Jin comes into North Korea after being sucked into a tornado. It makes zero sense that she survived the tornado while paragliding with no serious injury, and only had some cuts and bruises.
-The attitudes of the North Korean army members are too soft. It is unbelievable that there are so many nice guys.She had a different accent the whole time and no one found that suspicious. Even if she is a secret agent in SK she would still not forget her North Korean accent.-The selling of SK products at the market seems too easy. IN NK people are known for getting killed in such situations, so even people from the army buying those products are too unreal.",4
"Now, I don't know what to watch next because this one is definitely good. It gave me feelings and still this drama is in my head. Worth-watching.",10
"I love this show so much! I created an IMDB account just to rate and review CLOY.I usually don't watch Korean dramas, the last one I watched and got obsessed with was A Moment to Remember (2004). I really love the actress Son Ye-Jin, she was one of the reason I gave this show a try.The first episode got me instantly hooked; the amazing chemistry between the lead actors, breathtaking scenic backgrounds in Switzerland and Mongolia (suppose to represent North Korea) and soulful music. Actually not to mention the dramatic, action and funny scenes. You cannot help it to fall in love and relate to each character. In times of adversity and change this show really lifts me up and makes me feel like a teenager again. I never thought a show like this would provoke different emotions I had as a blissful teenager back in the days.Please watch this show! You will not get disappointed.Much thanks to all the people who were involved in this production. You added some corniness in my life.P.s. the OST song Sigriswill is sooo dreamy, serene and full of blissfulness!",10
"Hey, I'm not into Korean drama and I hate crying over sentimental scenes but this drama put me into uncharted territory. I couldn't imagine myself crying almost every episode but this one got into my nerves. The soundtrack is also very superb and well-made. The actors are very talented and there are a lot of funny scenes mixed with sentimental scenes. You'll fall in love in the first episode and will keep falling until the end. Good job producers for having this kind of show. It is really amazing. Love, love, love it..",10
I really amazed of captain ri and se ri love chemistry since 1st to last episode.both of them are amazing ??,10
"First of all, the actors didn't just act but lived the characters. This is the perfect mixture of all kind of emotions. The more we watch the more we will get immersed in the story. The affection and love among the characters, every gesture of the characters either will make you smile or cry. The more we watch the harder it will be to watch the last episodes knowing the pain that the characters will go through. I thank the team for making me cry. It is and will be one of my all time favourite.",10
"Had me on the edge of my seat in every episode.
Was waiting for the next weekend with the patience of a child.
The title might be cleche, but it delivered so much more than just smoke and mirrors.
It was amazing to see the characters grow to care and depend on each other.
The stakes are real and the serendipity added in between was done in a fresh manner that tugged at your heart strings.
If anything, it closed the rift between north and south a little bit. It introduced us to lives not telling us that the one way of life is better than another. It didnt make one particular nation evil and the other good.
What it has managed is to show us that people are what makes a place, regardless of what you have or where you are in the world.",10
"This is one truly amazing shows out there and I would recommend it to everyone. It truly has to offer something for everyone. From Prefect direction to Flawless acting by the cast and scenario saturation, it was a delight to watch. The show is partly based in North Korea and they have beautifully captured the culture and practices. The overall tone of the show is Happy and romantic which makes you feel good. I am super impressed with Lead actress Son Ye Jin, her acting is flawless. I was not sure earlier about Hyun bin, but he is also so good. And kudos to rest of the cast. I don remember their names but deserve mention.
Overall, this show was one delightful addition in my growing Korean shows list. Would recommend to everyone.",10
"I started crying at episode 7 and I am crying even more now that I have finished it. It is a great love story, funny, sad, romantic, never boring story. The actors are also great!",10
"The best romantic series ever!
The way they connect the moments was the best part of the series.
And such a strong acting from every cast member.
The only series that I watched in any other language by viewing the subtitles!",10
Probably the most overrated k-drama of all time. I don't get the hype surrounding this drama at all. It was pretty lame and boring,1
"I have read dozens of novels and short stories, hundreds of movies, series etc. yet I never felt the way I did when I watched crash ...The strange thing is that it reminded me of Geme of Thrones! The common element between the two is the little details. Every small detail has its own significance and aim. The small unimportant charecters sunddenly play a crucial role in the story! The cast are just wonderfull.It is not just a romantic story like many other series. No. It also highlights the sad political fact of seperating lovers, families and friends between the two Koreas in a remarkable manner. Words cannot describe how great it is and the best word I can think of is bravo.",10
"This movie compare north and south korea different,
made me reflect now live in city is so lucky.Love Hyun Bin & Ye-jin Son interaction between the two.
Beautiful scenes - main scene in swiss lake, play piano at pier.
Love song -yoon mi rae flower",8
"This TV series was amazing!!! Loved every moment of it! The actors and directors did an amazing job, you really feel apart of it!! Great mix of comedy and romance. Definitely recommend!",10
"This show is a flawless masterpiece. The storyline, screenplay, performance, direction - everything is top notch. And the chemistry between the protagonists is just unbelievable!!! It is not everyday that such shows are produced-probably once in an era. It is an absolute pathbreaking TV series. I guess I will switch off my TV for a few days to keep the warm feeling a little longer. Thanks to the entire team for delivering such a brilliant piece of art!",10
"Top notch acting. Great characters. Can make even the coldest of hearts to flutter! At the end of it. You'll walk away with a smile on your face. My first korean drama. Glad I watched it. Was very skeptical to begin with and had low expectations. My oh my, was impressed with this show. Do watch it.",10
This is one of the best k-dramas I've watched. Hyum Bin and So Ye Jin have this amazing chemistry that really takes you by storm! Is the ultimate love story of fate! A must watch!,10
This story is like a beautifully intertwined hairbraid. Hyun Bin and SJY looked great together. Supporting casts were very delightful. Nothing that I can complain about this drama. I'll watch it again definitely.,10
"I have watched C. L. O. Y. in netflix in early March due to the lockdown but my teenage daughter was pestering me for a month to watch it but I totally regretted it, since I fell in love with Hyun Bin and Son Ye Jin soon after. I've never been a fan of KD before but after CLOY I couldn't moved on. Their undeniable chemistry, superb casting, romantic scenes, myriad of emotions, brilliant director and cinematography, and the suitably perfect story/script! I wished TVN and Netflix will consider a part 2 or a new project for HB and SYJ considering the 1+ billion views of CLOY worldwide! #RiRi #BinJin",10
"I finished the show a while back but I just had to make an account to say just how good this show is.The two main leads are amazing, the two back up leads are amazing. The storyline is just amazing. A wonderful OST. Words doesn't do this show justice. Even if you aren't into KDramas, please just watch this show and you'll see it's just as good as any other show.Ever since I finished this show, I've just been on a continuous binge of watching Korean shows and i can honestly tell you, nothing comes close to it.But I'm also grateful because watching Crash Landing On You has opened up my love for Korean shows and now I just can't get enough of them.",10
"I did on n off watch Korean drama since ""steps to heaven"", ""im from stars"", but these years many Korean drama did disappoint me until watching this one. It just melt my heart and the charm of this movie really make me return to 17 yo again. It didn't make you cry heavily but feel sad and warm the same time. The scenery in Swiss is amazing but most importantly the storyline is up to the standard and not waste the money spent in filming aboard. Some drama just film oversea but the story didn't good enough, it's a waste. I would think of the story end in the way using reunification of south and north years after for the leading actor n actress to meet again. If it is so, I think this drama will be more controversial and draw lots more attention. Even it end that way, it's very good enough for the whole series and very laughable for many scenes as well.",9
"Everything about this Kdrama were so easy to fall in love with. The beautiful story, magnificent scenery, heart touching soundtrack, and the chemistry of main characters Captain Ri and Yoon Se Ri makes your heart melt.",10
Loved and enjoyed watching the movie so much. Perfect chemistry. Captivating story line. Beautifully directed. Great actors and actress ?,10
"This is up there in my favourite list, it's a fairly unlikely story with a lot of laughter, suspense, cheese, drama, hilarity and some very good actors. The showing of the differences in the two worlds of Korea in a very respectful, human way was lovely. While we all know the differences, the daily lives of these people are still the same - food, love, family and work. It's a shame the world is the way it is, but essentially we're all after the same thing and whether you're rich, poor, powerful or midway, the feels are still there. I only wish the mean fiancee had fared better, but even her ending was reasonable. Watch this, even just for the eye candy and funny moments like the young guy getting all the mysterious business cards from random people :)",10
"Son Ye Jin and Hyun Bin are two of my favorite actors, but I am now at episode 9 and can only watch it with the fast forward button.
The episodes are way too long, the evil doer are overacting/overacted, lots of impossibilities (tornado and no broken bones,...) and I see no chemistry between the leads. When I think about Son Ye Jin in ""something in the rain"" with her co-star....I would have believed they date for real!
I think I spend my Corona-isolated Easter holidays with something else.",6
"Like others shared, one of the best Korean dramas ever. The writing (it is just soooo good) and OST, actors, just so amazing.Highly recommend! <3",10
I love the plot and the intrigue! The actors play remarkably well as if the have a real chemistry outside the series. I would truly recommend this series for anyone. It's fun and dramatic in the same time.,10
Sweet romance story and brilliant humour throughout,10
"I don't think I can ever get over some scenes from this drama (especially Hyun bin and sonye-jin last goodbye from episode 15), cried like a baby and I don't regret it.",10
"This story is really, really good and I highly recommend it. It's a complete story because it has it all: drama, romance, action and comedy. It also has a very good cast, with very beautiful women. Without such a cast, the scrip would never have been put in value so well. :)Personally, I related to the story even more, having been born in a former Communist country. So almost everything presented in the show looked very familiar. In reality, some of them were even worse than in this show, but the writers did a pretty good job introducing them in the story without having to shock the audience.",10
I liked these drama. I mainly watched this drama because of the high anticipation and reviews. But I don't think it's as good as dots or goblin.I liked the 2nd couple more than the lead couple. So I DON'T THINK the 2nd male lead had to die. There was no basis in his death. I mean the main lead took so much risks. He even escaped to another country to keep his girl safe and not a single thing happened to him.??????I also hated the fact that Gu seung joo's death was not mourned by any. Not even the lead actress(he was her ex fiance and helped her go back to south korea). I think his last death scene(where the seo dan was taken as hostage) was not well written. It seemed like the writer wanted to finish this as fast as possible.The humour was great especially after they(Hyun bin and his comrades) escaped to south korea. Tbh I really liked the 4 comrades. They were awesome. It's because of them I could complete this show.,7
"It's such a great romantic comedy and the actors are so good. I laughed when they laughed, i cried when they cried. First i was not sure that i want to watch this movie but i am sooo glad i started it...after the first minutes of the first episoade, i couldn't leave it. I surely recommend it. I'm a little sad that it ended, i would definetly watch more seasons of it. And the end it's partially sad from my point of view... I mean they lived the rest of their lives being together only 2 weeks per year? But it's super great anyway. I started watching movies with Hyun Bin now ?? and Ye-jin Son.",10
"When I finished the show the first time, I immediately started on the first episode again; on the same day! Besides the main aspects of the show, all the other aspects, minor or otherwise were so well done!
The dialogue, the scenery's, the supporting plots etc etc. You would fall in love with the supporting characters for sure. You would remember the dialogues almost instantly. You would hit rewind just to see the set and scenery again.
Love that all the other major plots that are interlinked into the main love story are so well thought of and executed!
Planning to watch for the third time again!...... And maybe the fourth!",10
Beautiful story...like they say..it was destiny that seri and captain Ri met...beautiful and happy ending.,10
"I seldom write my reviews and comments but for this K-drama, I can't let it pass by giving it a perfect 10 in all aspects...This is the 3rd K-drama I've watched...first was Kingdom which is also very good, then The K2 which is just as watchable....but mind you, this K-drama is something different from all the shows and movies I've seen.....The story is somewhat un-believable but also possible to happen...the plot is so complex and it goes deeper and heavier every episode that you want to complete and know the ending soonest. The 2 main stars are so good looking, lovable and their pair has great chemistry...The many supporting casts added spice to the show....if not them providing the humor, it will be all tears and crying for the whole 16 episodes which may be too hard to handle. There are also some action and suspenseful scenes that really made the show complete. I quite find the last episode too long though that dampened all the hysteria...This is so far the BEST TV Show I've seen...",10
"The best kdrama I've ever watched, hoping for a season 2 ??",10
This is a very good moving series. I hope that the South Korean organization will put them in USB and fly the balloon over the border. These series will destroy Kim's regime much faster than we can imagine.,10
"What a stunning performance delivered by versatile actress Son Ye Jin and handsome Hyun Bin. They really have a good charismatic chemistry. Casts were spectacular and they are all geniuses with their roles. I definitely admire how they portray about love for family, relationships, friends, subordinates, country, etc.. This is an example that your hoping in some scenes if only... I numerous cried with them, laugh with them and fear with them, what a moving scenes from Episode 1-16. I finished the whole series in 2 days. It is also a reminder that true love really happens. Kamsahamnida!!! xxx",10
"I have seen a lot of TV shows over the years. While there are now more quality TV shows than ever, I more an more gave up, that a show will come along, that will get a spot in my top ten list. This show does.At moments I even thought it will reach the top spot, occupied since 15 years by Farscape. Just a few boring moments, overly constructed events and a few other little problems in the last few episodes hindered it to become my no. 1.But make no mistake, this is one of the best TV shows ever created.
The cast is awesome. From the smallest role up to the two main Actors. Especially Ye-jin Son is just perfect.Story, visuals and music are very well done. Very interesting scenario and story, beautiful locations and songs, that you want to hear over and over.If you like shows, that have a little bit of everything and especially a lot of emotion, this one might be for you. Most of the time it's very romantic, funny and dramatic.",9
"I am not a big fan of Korean drama
. However this is stunning. I keep watching it and finished just in 3days. Two lead actors are stunning and the story is out of the world it is totally brand new.I hope to have season 2 even if there is no plan.",10
"Absolutely fascinating mixture of comedy and drama, action and romance. Chemistry between the leading characters works perfectly, makes everything believable, while one can only enjoy immensely the subtle humor and the irony surrounding the overall conflict of two completely different lifestyles and cultures.",10
"I LOVE THIS SHOW! I can only echo what everyone is saying about this series. The superb cast, the clever and heart-rending story had me on the edge of my seat for 16 binged episodes. My face hurts from smiling and crying so much.My only complaint is a technical one--the non-existant and quickly-disappearing subtitles although the acting was so good I could figure out the story as anyway.",10
Strange title since it has its oen english title see netflix. Searching for Korean drama english gets more difficult every time. Too bad.,2
Already lockdown and now with all the free time in the world i just want to re-watch this series but also it making me feel so empty that I just don't want to.??,10
"Thankyouuuu for the movie!!!
create the season 2,please !",9
"Inspired by true events of a South Korean actress and three others that had to be rescued when their leisure boat crossed the maritime border between the two Koreas, we follow Se-ri's escapades as she tries to go back to the South when a freak tornado unexpectedly lands her in the North. Captain Jeong-Hyuk, compassionate to a fault aids her even it means risking his life and that of his loved ones. Their misadventures of almost always getting her out only to be thwarted unexpectedly forces them to live together and they start to develop feelings for each other, even if it goes against every fiber of their being.Aside from the obvious elements as to why the show was a huge success: good-looking leads, star-crossed lovers, great supporting cast, and idyllic locales (both Mongolia as a stand-in for North Korea and Switzerland), the other contributing factor is the reversed rags-to-riches storyline of Se-ri adjusting to the North Korean lifestyle, giving us a glimpse as to how life is in a country that for the most part has been concealed to the rest of the world. The show had helped from NoKor defectors to depict as much accuracy as possible to the details presented. One criticism given is the romanticizing of the North, normally depicted as the villains in pop culture, while others agree the show gave them the right degree of humanity given the circumstances. I lean more towards the latter, but it is of note that the show also gave the impression that only the Southerners are interested in reunification while the Northerners are completely fine on their own.Hyun Bin was charming as Captain Ri and Son Ye-jin was believable as the strong and independent Se-ri. They had palpable chemistry and the only criticism I have is that the villain Cho Cheol Gong's arc was too prolonged which they could've shortened to give the two more scenes together while in the South. I mean we all felt sorry for Captain Ri when his gaming time was reduced, we needed more cute moments like that. Seo Dan as one-half of the back-up couple for me was more imposing than Se-ri and we should see more of the actress Seo Ji-hye in the future. All the other supporting casts were memorable most notably Ri's troops, Se-ri's assistants and the women of Ri's village.Lastly some takeaways from the show: A.) Martial Law or any form of government run by the military doesn't necessarily equate to a better government. As seen many times over, it is prone to corruption as even Captain Ri bypassed protocols and favors were thrown around incessantly. B.) Love cannot, and should not be hampered by any man-made laws (this includes arranged marriages, or discrimination against religion, race and same-sex relationships.) Their arrangement of meeting yearly for a limited period may be less than ideal, but love wins and will always find a way. There is no right or wrong way to love, only that love is unconditional.",8
"Where was I till now? Why didn't I ever try any Korean Drama? Why didn't I know about Hyun Bin?
This is my first ever K-Drama and I'll be honest here. I loved it. It's a beautiful, heartbreaking, and an excellent series. Everything is amazing - Story, Main Leads, Their Chemistry, Acting, Thrill, Action Sequence, Star Cast, Background Score, Music. I completed this series in 3 days and I am suffering from Post Drama Syndrome now. I can't get over it. After completing this series, like everyone else, I am searching everything about CLOY on YouTube, Google.This is such a series which will never leave you. No matter how hard you'll try you can't forget it. You'll fall in love with all the characters, be it Captain Ri Jung Hyuk, Yoon Se ri, Gu Seung joon or Park Kwang beom. They all justified their characters and got immense love from viewers. You'll cry with them, laugh with them and start feeling their pain & emotions.And what to say about Hyun Bin and Son Ye Jin chemistry. It's magical. You'll start rooting for them. Hyun Bin was Rustic and Rough in NK but Classic and Dashing in SK. He can be tough and cute at the same time. He totally nailed his role and I read that he learned Piano for this role. Son Ye Jin was a great choice for the role of Yoon Se Ri. She played her role as a helpless SK Woman in NK and a strong, confident businesswoman in SK. I especially loved her character development.I have fallen in love with CLOY. And I am definitely going to watch other K-Dramas now. And this is my first ever review on IMDb. I created my account on IMDb to let South Korean people know that I have fallen in love with your country, your culture, your actors, and film industry. Lots of love from India! This series made me feel like visiting South Korea and having some friends from that land in my life :) Lots of love!",10
"Their story of love, the love and genuine support their families and friends is just heartbreaking. I've never in my life been so touched by anything. And omg not to mention the cinematography, soundtrack, casting and plot. The idea of a realistic Romeo and Juliet type scenario is captivating and beautiful. Watch it, cry to it. 11/10.",10
"Absolutely captivating story, beautiful places, touching scenes and an amazing chemistry between the lead actors. I loved it. Still crying.",10
"This is phenomenal. I made this account just to write this review. It's a combination of humor, tension and flirting all over the episodes and it never gets boring. Please give me more! With love, from Belgium.",10
"Simply not possible not to like it.
Its captivating, combines action, romance, family issues, political matters, true feelings, emotions, dreams and disappointments.",10
"This is my first ever korean drama and I am glad I chose this. I don't have words to explain how I felt watching this series. You need to witness the magic on the screen. It had everything. Emotions, Perfect main couple, annoying antagonist, great side characters and their struggles. I loved it would be an understatement. This was the second time I cried watching a tv series after the red wedding in GOT. More people need to watch this amazing story. The only flaw I found was that every episode was almost the length of a movie but it's not like I didn't enjoy it. I wouldn't even call it a flaw coz I prefer series with shorter episodes.",9
"I would never thought a K-Drama could have so much impact in my life. The plot, the actors, the places, the chemistry, even the OST makes this series an absolute masterpiece. I have never cried that much over a series. CLOY made it to my TOP 5 of all time. Absolutely addictive. I thought everyone was very close to me and I was so sad when it finished.",10
"Rating - 8.5/10
Review -
This drama was great from the beginning. The actors are all amazing from the ML to the support characters.
The plot had the right dose of rom-com, heartwarming gestures,dialogues and action.
ML and FL watching them come together is a joy to watch.
'Crash Landing on You' should be on everyone's 2020 kdrama watchlist. Strongly recommend!
#Netflix #kdrama ????????",8
I have never seen K dramas before and this was my first one. Loved every bit of it!,10
"I was between giving it a 8 or a 9 but I guess I go with a 9 because even if it was not completely my style, it still was a very good KD.
I would have liked a little bit more action and happier ending. The idea of them meeting just 2 weeks per yeat in Swiss made me very sad. It also bothered me that the con artist died... Why? He was a very good man in the end. It was the only moment during the movie when i cried. It would have been better to leave him alive.
Besides than this, the differences betwen North and South are so well displayed. It made me search the internet more about North Korea and see if things really are like that. Good job for the story writer.",9
"I landed on CLOY by accident, a tip on a french site. I am still shocked after having watched the full serie in a few days,
The whole thing works, the alchemy between the actors, the story line, the unexpected twists, the non standard story telling, the humor , the slow pace focused on the emotional rollercoasters of the different heroes.
The further it goes, the most unbelievable sweet it turns into, that I would normally switch to a different program, but you can't escape it, You get into the Korean story line, the obvious dilemmas in the relationship that 's building up and up.There should not be a second season, the end is what it is, but it will remain one of a kind TV impact for me, as I experienced ""the breakfast club"" a long time ago. I have not been kept awake by a TV program before, so strange. Very grateful to have seen this.And I guess that the Swiss Tourism office will see a massive increase of Korean or CLOY whenever the lock down has been raised.",10
"Well written, edge of you seat show. Has everything from drama, romance, comedy and action.
An excellent K Drama that brings life in North Korea to the screens",10
"I loved everything: the story, the music, the actors, dialogs, a fun. Everything. I really enjoyed it from the first minute. They even made me cry several times.",10
"Last K drama I watched was princess hour. In my late 30s, I was told by EVERYONE of my friends and workplace colleagues to watch. After a struggled to watch and reluctance many weeks, one episode, bang, here I watched continuously for 2 days. Until now, I still kept repeat watching for tenth time. The palpable chemistry of both actors could exploded whole North korea, albeit there was very small intimated love scenes. You kept watching laughing, smiling, picking your pillow and crying whole boxed of tissues in one episode. Probably one drama like this in ten years time.
The Romeo Juliet love story like this could not be felt if not the superb acting on both protagonist actors. I hope they will get many awards and some chances to perform in Hollywood series one day.",10
"I finished watching this show two days ago, and I just can't get it our of my head. It feels like I have a broken heart. So I had to make an IMDB account in order to write a review to this surprisingly impressionable show. Maybe it will help my grieving process.The show is well balanced, and takes you through a huge reservoir of emotions. I've cried and laugh, felt fear and joy. At the beginning I wasn't all that sure. In the first episodes I thought the story seemed to predictable, and at times whimsical. But boy was I wrong. After two episodes I couldn't stop watching. I finished the entire series in three days.The main characters have captivating stories, and the actors are able to portray thoughts and emotions in a superb manner. Even though I couldn't understand the language, I felt like I could.The script is well written. There is no unnecessary dialogue, the character say what is needed. And nothing is over explained. The main plot has many layers, and I catch myself thinking back at different moments in the storyline more than once during the day. The side stories give you a glimpse of the lives of ordinary people in a country far different from my own. Even the seemingly dim neighbors get a special place in your heart. The acting is superb. The mimic of some of the supporting actors seem a bit dramatic at first, but somehow it just fits. Everything feels natural, something that is often lacking in Hollywood productions. The main cast are able to give us a nuanced portrait of human emotions.I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll stop here. All I wanted to say was: WATCH IT.",10
"It was a long time that I had not watched K-drama before watching this drama and I must say I made a right decision. This drama packsgreat scenery: the color and atmosphere are so soothing in Swiss that you wish you could be therelaughs and humor: unpredictable punch lines are not scarcebeautiful love story: you will smile /cry happily and swoon for the couples' cheesy momentsplot full of twists: this drama is not some kind of bland linear story. Its story has depth and meaningmany more: hot actors and actresses, funny supporting characters and lots of moral and life lessons delivered in deep and gentle waysJust watch it and you will have a good time",10
"What a rollercoaster of an experience. The absolute best romantic drama I've seen to date. Nothing much to say, just watch it. It will forever be etched in your memory.",10
"I never understood the global appeal a d popularity of K pop music, dramas and frankly, would have been ignorant if I hadn't given it a try. Netflix happened to be promoting this new title and I enjoyed the trailer...peaked my curiousity and wanted to see more.
I was hooked by the first episode - the witty script, dialogue, music, songs, cinematography and the palpable chemistry not only between the leads but the whole cast - it really caught me pleasantly off guard!
I have and continue to binge watch - since mid february till now (first week of May), I have completed seven K drama series! Am on my eighth one now.
I do have a clear favourite actor - Hyun Bin and pretty sure, many other talented names will be added to this list.
In lockdown, good opportunity to get 'pop cultured'!",9
"I watched the first episode of this one back when it first started to play on Netflix. After that, it wasn't until the full series was available and had been for a while that I went back and watched the rest of the show.I really enjoyed the show, whose two main stars I have seen in other shows that I also loved. It was quite slow moving, but had plenty of tension, action and laughs along the way. The way it ended was interesting, as I guess it was quite realistic - but also would you want to live your life like that? Well, I guess it's better than nothing right?Anyway, I'm not sure how much I can take as gospel the information gleaned about life in North Korea from this show, and I'd never presume to believe I'm now an expert - but it was still interesting to get that insight.I loved all the supporting characters as well as the main hero and heroine. This show might not be one of my all-time faves, but it's one I may watch again someday, so I'm calling it a good one. :)",8
"Perfect. Just perfect--- the cast, the storyline, the scenery, the chemistry of the two leads. This drama gives you the all in one package. You will cry now then laugh later. You begin to see how great it is to be loved and to love someone. Love, indeed, has no boundaries. For me, this is my best Korean drama of all time. I will surely be watching it over and over again. It touched the hearts and minds of almost all the people around the world despite of the pandemic. Will be forever a fan of CLOY even years from now.",10
This is as good as any other love story made. Loosely based on an actual event where the writer got helped from locals(probably dead now in the hands of Kim) after their boat landed in NoKo during a storm. Watch,9
"I cannot count how many times I re-watch this drama. Maybe it has been for a long long time I didn't watch any Korean drama, because anytime I start to watch begining episodes, I wouldn't like to continue for watchibg this dramas. So, I didn't watch any drama from that time. But ""Crash Landing On You"" is the difference. I was attracted by this serrano. Yoon Se Ri and Ri Jung Hyuk always know how to push my feeling to climax. So funny and also so touched. I don't know how I could use words to describ. But, you shall not be regret to watch ""Crash Landing On You"". I am sure.",10
"I watched this during a vacation on Tet Holiday in Vietnam. This is the best K-drama in 2020 in my opinion <3 I appreciate their beauties, their acting and their connection in drama, in BTS and in real life. When I watched this drama, I smiled, cried a lot. No words can describe how amazing this drama is ~ Must watch!!!!",10
Just made IMDB account to write a review for this series. You can't take off your series while seeing this series. From the smile of jeong hyeok to the cuteness of se ri everything is just lovely. Beautiful potrayal of both the countries. 100 hearts to it <3,10
"If there is only one drama you have to watch in your entire life, it has to be crash landing on
you, nothing else.",10
"Very unique story line with a roller coaster of emotion that you can't predict what will happen on the next episode. Also not just the 2 main leads did shine here, all the supporting characters did also shine both antagonist and protagonist. Showing their own stories. My forever TOP 1 favorite :)",10
"Where do I even begin? This series was perfect from start to finish. I was hooked during the first scene. I watched it all in just a few days and I have never cried more in life. Every single character was compelling with their own unique personalities and characteristics.I'm a huge fan of kdramas, but I'm convinced any casual lover of TV would LOVE this show. It's not too cheesy like some Kdramas and it was VERY well produced with a beautiful score and cinematography.I have to give them props for the realism of the portrayal of North Korea. The North Korean characters felt like normal, everyday people and weren't vilified or ostracized just based on their nationality.I don't want to spoil too much of it, but I will say that at first I was bit upset about the ending but it was so well executed that it's grown on me and I'm satisfied with it.I DO want to talk about the elephant in the room-the main leads' acting. Oh my lord, they are PHENOMENAL actors. Hyun Bin and Son Ye-jin are some of the best actors I've ever seen-topping most western actors easily. Son Ye-jin's crying is so convincing and doesn't across as faked or forced. And you can really feel how much Jeong-hyeok loves Se-ri thanks to Hyun Bin's portrayal. Now that I've finished the series I'm gonna make sure to watch EVERYTHING else these actors are in.I give this series an 11 out of 10 stars. It's now in my top 5 favorite TV shows of all time.Don't let the run time of the episodes or the different language throw you off from watching this. It's worth it!!!!Meanwhile, I may end up watching this again...",10
Oooooh My God. That was amazing series that i've ever seen.,10
"The romance is very cute in this show. However, I think one of the most important things this show accomplishes is educating us about North Korea.Many NK defectors were interviewed in order to make this show, so this may be one of the more accurate depictions of NK in South Korean film. I think it is excellently done. I enjoyed how they did not depict NK as pure evil, like some past films may have done. It shows the life of NK commoners, who are normal people just like us. It's the higher-ups that are corrupt.I really enjoyed learning more about NK through this film, and I think it is great that this show has reached such a wide audience! This way, everyone can learn a little bit more.Many parts of this film is accurate, but there are some exaggerations (e.g. escaping NK is not even close to being as easy as the film makes it seem).Yet, overall, this is a lovely drama. I definitely recommend this.",10
"Until ""Crash Landing on You"", I had never saw a Korean tv series or a KDrama. Well, I probably never saw a tv series that could be classified as a love story or a romantic comedy.""Crash Landing on You"" was an absolute surprise and clear deserves all the recognition possible.
In short, several things stand out:The quality of the plot - very dynamic, with an incredible high pace and really well written. Every episode has so much depth that could really be squeezed in a whole season. The plot also offers a really high range of comedy, drama, action and romantic stories. In most of the cases, the caracters make the most reasonable and logical actions - and this is not always common;The vibe of North Korea - a credible, deep, human and interesting dive in the most unknown culture and society of the world;The quality of the actors - some of them, specially some of the secondary actors really stand out and create an impact with a really low screen time;It was hard for me to explain to others why I was absolutly hooked to a korean drama. Give it a go. More than simply a love story, it is a fantastic insight in the korean culture and a great comedy.",10
"Hyun Bin is by far my most favorite Korean actor. After enjoying Memories of the Alhambra I was looking forward to Crash Landing on you. It didn't disappoint. He had great chemistry with the leading lady in both series.I really liked Se-ri's friendship with the soldiers and the women in the village. The story woven into how Ri Jung Hyuk and Se-ri met each other in the past was well done. How caring Ri Jung Hyuk is towards Se-ri is like the perfect man a woman could wish for. Their chemistry and with all the other cast members were great.Only thing is like most Korean dramas there are some scenes repeating, this could maybe shorten te episodes, because sometimes it will get a little draggy.But overall lovely romantic show!",8
"This show was my foray into world of Korean dramas. Content, acting, research into lives of North Koreans, everything executed to perfection.The character of Ri jyong hyeok and Yoon seri will live with us for years to come. Romance as a subject has been explored tirelessly over the years however, the main protagonists brought an unusual freshness, novelty on screen. Ri's comrades were not usual fillers, they had important roles and all of them played their bit with utmost diligence.The show rightly captures the basic tenets of human values, emotions, irrespective of the side of border we are born and grow up. What sacred games did to Netflix in India, narcos to Netflix in Spanish speaking Latin America, crash landing on you may open up the world to League of K dramas.Extraordinary is an understatement for this show.",10
"I absolutely adored this beautiful, funny, tense of a series.Fanstastic acting - specifically to Captains Ri's four comrades who really stole the show at times! However, I loved them all and was so invested in all their individual storylines.I'd love a second season, but I do appreciate the simplicity of the ending. It stays true to the complexity of their relationship and doesn't just give the viewer a stereotypical happy ending.I loved it through and through. This series will be hard to replace!",10
"If this is worth 10 stars than so is Dynasty or Beverly Hills, 90210. And be sure that it's the same type of audience thus show is aimed at.
The only differences are the more Oriental setting and semi-politically controversial premise (S.Korea-N.Korea Divide), but make no mistake it's the same soap/melodramatic style as the titles mentioned above.",5
It is so hyped because of the lead actors. The ending can be easily predicted. Some parts are very cringey.,5
I never watched storyline like this each and every corner of this movie is just wow,10
"Crash Landing on You makes you feel the love to your bones! Love is too vague but at the same time too simple! It makes you feel happy, miserable, shocked! And CLON's team just show us how precious love is! Thank you guys! Thanks a million!",10
"The show has an intriguing main topic: North-Korea&South-Korea issues, and a love stuck in between. At least this was what I thought it was...However, the plot is ruined by just too much action scenes, too many unfortunate events, and too little romance&comedy which was supposed to be the genre. The starred couple is even rarely seen together during the episodes!K-dramas are normally 40-45 mins. long, yet this one lasts for 1.5 hours for some reason. It is not hard to observe that they pushed to make it this long by using uncalled scenes, flashbacks and everything. I mean, why?In a nutshell, if you are looking for a lovely jubbly, heart warming drama, this isn't the one.",6
Dont understand why a fantastic platform like netflix invested in this dumb series that doesnt even a story line.Moreover its a waste to waste the time to pass or be entertained,1
"I started watching the drama because it was constantly being recommended to me. And wow, once i started watching , i couldn't stop. The cast, their chemistry was remarkable. I kept smiling from ear to ear at many scenes . It is a drama i would watch again and again. I just know it.
Highly recommend you watch it!",10
"After watching this amazing heart melting drama, I couldn't be the same person before. It is not a fantasy which might be happen in movies or series. The pure love is always real! And CLOY just help us to see such reality and feel it in our every angle of our lives!",10
"My first Korean series and it was so well done, it spoiled me from finding another KD as great as this. The action, the characters, the styling the clothes...what can I say? Don't miss this.",10
"Since many years, North Korea has been a huge interest of mine. A closed off, brutal yet fascinating country. Seeing this series appear while scrolling through titles on Netflix. I knew for an instant, I'm going to watch this series. Watched the first episode right away, watched another. Kept on going. A few days later, episode 16 ends and I'm speechless. Never could I have imagined being so hooked. Crash landing on you or Sa-rang-eui bul-sa-chak is something way more than most things I've ever seen before. It's absurd, humorous, it's beautiful. Acting, camera work, soundtrack, everything on point. There were a few instances where things perhaps got a little too cliche but all in all, this is a unique story, a genius story. Easily one of the best series I've ever seen. Without a doubt, you won't regret watching it.",9
"My daughter usually watches a lot of Korean dramas and after watching Parasite my interest was peaked. I was looking for something new after watching the Office for the 12th time and I WAS AMAZED! This is by far one of the BEST programs I've ever seen! It is hilarious and serious at times, but it is excellent entertainment! I just had to write a review for this because of how good it is. Probably my only review but we'll see what Netflix has in store for us! A film you can watch with the whole family!",10
"The story of CLOY is very engaging between the fantasy of two star-crossed lovers from the North Ri Jeong Hyeok and South Yoon Seri. The built-in chemistry played by the two characters lead roles, Hyun Bin and Son Ye Jin on CLOY demonstrated their excellent performance, which perfectly fits in those heart-wrenching moments. The use of flashbacks supported an almost seamless transition and caused us to discover the characters of the two lead roles better. Credits, in addition, should be given to the great supporting casts performance. Each of them included a bit of spice, which strikes the exact balance of romance, comedy, suspense and drama. Definitely, CLOY's Ri Jeong Hyeok and Yoon Seri's got me crashed and hooked on the story. It transports us to a place where love knows no boundaries. It swoons us once again with their love testimonials, which makes one's heart flutter and give butterflies into the stomach. CLOY's cohesive story and strong execution from noted cast performances of Hyu Bin and Son Hye Jin is well- loved. Hopefully, if they can come up with another season or another brilliant and intense CLOY story adaptation yet to tell, about Ri Jeong Hyeok and Yoon Seri's long distance relationship struggles and their exact fate in will be worth waiting to it's followers in the end.",9

"I have never watched any Korean web series and this is my first Korean series.
I would like to say it's the best web series I have seen. I want to give unlimited stars not just only 10.
This webseries actually tells you about the true Love
This web series will make you cry in every episode of it, and you will never come out of it even if the Web series is finished.
I would recommend every one to see it and understand what is true love.
Finally I should say it's a sweet love story that every one must watch.",10
"I'm just one of the many who found it extremely hard to move on after watching this. This series has amazing everything (acting, story, directing, editing, soundtrack, cinematography, casting and chemistry, production design) technically speaking. It's so beautifully made that all cinematic elements fell harmoniously into place with all scenes arranged logically to achieve the desired effect on viewers. There were no unnecessary scenes and dialogs, hence, no boring moments. All scenes were skillfully executed with perfectly calculated movements and delivery of lines by the actors, especially the leads Son Ye jin and Hyun Bin. After watching this, it's been difficult, painful even, for me to watch other Kdramas as I have found the gold standard for Korean drama series. It's clearly a masterpiece.",10
Can't stop watching this drama. Best ever Korean drama have ever watched in my life.??????,10
"One of the best developed romances I have ever watched. (There is only three or four) Such well handled story: From the second episode until the end I was, as everytime I like a show so much, anxiously hoping they could keep the high level until the end. And they didn't disappoint.
I even liked the set of ducklings that would follow their Captain to hell and back. They could have been annoying, but I found myself liking them almost as much as the main characters.
And who wouldn't follow Captain Ri anywere? I fell in love with his personality in the second episode, swooned with the final scene of the fourth and cried for him until the final one. The fact that such outstanding personality had the body and face of Hyun Bin didn't hurt.
Although it drags a little in the middle, it's hard for us, high-standards-romantics, find a quality show like this, that is original, mostly logic, has a grater-than-life hero and love story, and is not cheesy. If you are the kind of romantic that has sworn off Hallmark movies, this one is for you.",10
"This is by far the most beautiful love story I have ever seen in a TV drama. Series of 16 episodes will take you to a journey where it will be hard to return for a while. Story is so gripping that you will hardly get enough of an hour episode. Chemistry between two finest Korean actors will make you fall in love with the concept of it. It will remind you of that feel even it was in your last life. It will make you laugh then suddenly you will realize there is something in your eyes. It has so many great scenes which will 'FLUTTER' your heart. Supporting actors are equally good. Story will take you to a ride of mix emotions, but you will remember this for a long time. I really fell in love with Ye-jin Son after watching this show.",10
"Oh my God......I just don't have words to describe how much I loved this show. I have watched more than 100 Korean dramas but this one is my favorite.
How awesome this drama is can't be described in this single review.it is the best Korean dramas ever.",10
For some reason this drama is popular among non-Korean audience.This drama is cringe and typical.If you like Descendants of the Sun then this drama is for you.I was excited because it's Hyun Bin X Son Ye Jin but this drama was a let down for me. No depth.,2
"Created an account just to give a 10 stars because that's what they deserved. After watching this, I've been fast forwarding or just stop any movie/drama I watched after, then go back to rewatch CLOY.Like Yoon Seri, I think my standard is too high now.",10
"Made an account right after watching this drama to rate it ! I've been watching Kdramas for years and this is the best drama I've ever watched. GREAT characters,story and music. recommend it to you all.",10
Storyline abit slow but managed to pick up and keep me hooked.,10
"This is the 2nd K Drama I have watched and this has made my expectations really high for them. I am awe struck with the characters, story and music. This has made me a huge fan of Hyun Bin, Son Yejin and Kim Jung Hyun.. I think I am going to watch a lot of shows of Hyun Bin now. One of my fav show after a long time. I am going to watch it again and again. The way they have connected the story it's beautiful. Would really recommend this to everyone to watch it once. The cast is spot on. Loved it. Descendants of the Sun is the 1st KDrama I have watched which is good, but this blows your mind away making you addicted to the show and Hyun Bin :(",9
"""Crash Landing On You"", this is one of my all time favourite ????
Must Watch ????",10
"If you don't want to get hooked on K-Dramas, don't watch this series. Acting, chemistry and story line were awesome.",10
"The whole cast, from the undeniably outstanding chemistry of our couple, director, writer, the whole cast, staff - they have their all. Everything was/is perfect. It opened the hearts of many people all over the world. It raised the bar so high in acting versatility that couldn't help comparing it to others (unfair though) for those who haven't tried Kdrama, this one's for you, it worked for me ;)",10
I have watched kdramas for years and this is my favorite one! You can feel the real love between 2 main characters and I have laughed and cried for many times. Warm story.,10
"Crash Landing On You is a quite thrilling and amazing to watch from the beginning to the end because it contains love, romance, curiosity, comedy, passion, and vengeance. Hyun Bin is a such a talented actor who did a great job in this character and So Yi Jin is also the perfect match for this. I loved this tv show a lot.",10
I really enjoyed the show no it's amazing to see the effort of the production to create this comparison between the life of North Korea and South Korea the love in between is stronger than ever and it is really well done 1,10
A wonderful drama that has everything a romantic lovestory needs. It was my 65 year old mother who recommened it for me so I have to thank her! ??,9
"If I could give this series more stars I would. The angst and romance in this is above par with the junk Hollywood is putting out. The secondary characters are hilarious and wonderful. The main characters are beautiful, heartfelt, and make you fall in love with them. This series has ruined any show I'll watch from now on. They've raised the bar on the formula for the perfect entertainment series. Take note Hollywood. South Korea knows how to entertain...and fall in love.",10
Dont have words to describe..a must watch..Yoon se-ri and captain Ri Jung hyuk were masterclass.. even the other cast were amazing..,9
"I watched ""Descendants of the Sun"" and wondered if I'd see another series that could match it. Then, I watched ""Mr. Sunshine,"" and thought, ""there's no way I'll ever see another series like this."" Imagine the joy of being wrong twice! Along comes, ""Crash Landing on You,"" which may end up being my favorite of all of them. It's a toss-up between this and Mr. Sunshine. In short, this is one of the best series I've ever seen, and for me, the Korean Dramas I've watched have not disappointed at all as most are character and plot driven. In fact, overall, I've seen better quality shows out of Korea and Japan in the last several years than I have with American shows.The writing, and especially, the editing is some of the best I've ever seen. The plot is intricately weaved, not using some of the typical cliches and devices as some shows do when trying to get the two main characters together. In this case, we're given the beautiful wise lesson on screen: happiness is in the journey. Not the destination.Seri is a woman who owns her own company and is part of an extremely rich family. Her world, despite the money and success, is cold and empty. She sits alone in a massive penthouse. She has all of the luxuries that one could ask for. However, she has a family, especially her half-siblings, who are about as cut-throat as anyone could imagine. She doesn't realize what is missing in her life until a storm, while para-gliding, blows her across the border into North Korea.Ri Jeong-Hyeok is a North Korean captain who comes across Seri. At first, he and his unit of men aren't sure who Seri is and why she's there. Ri Jeong-Hyeok was a master pianist before joining the military, and intent on solving the mystery of his older brother's death. At first, he seems very straight-forward and unassuming, while underneath is a man full of life, passion, and love.The first set of episodes of Seri trying to adapt to life in a North Korean village are especially hilarious. Imagine a pampered woman suddenly having to go without electricity? How to take a bath...how to cook, etc. As a former Peace Corps volunteer, I know full well what this adaptation feels like!Perhaps for the first time in her life, Seri not only finds a connection with Ri Jeong-Hyeok, but also with the village women and also with the members of Ri Jeong-Hyeok's unit. It's ironic that she had to cross the border to find a group of people who were more like family for her than her real family back home!The best plots are ones that aren't forced or contrived, and this one doesn't use either one. We are taken effortlessly from North Korea into South Korea as Seri and Ri Jeong-Hyeok find themselves at the center of two sinister plots, each one contrived by people on either side (North and South Korea).Of course, the biggest question is: despite the situations they must survive and unravel, can they spend a life together? Is it feasible for two people, from the only divided country in the world, be able to have a relationship? North Korea might as well be the darkside of the moon, as communications between the people of the two countries is non-existent. Finding the answer to this question is the beauty of the journey of this series.The entire cast is simply terrific. They meticulously and effortlessly give us endearing characters who are absolutely hilarious at times and heartfelt at others. All are also able to deftly convey a range of emotions, especially the two leads in Hyun Bin and Ye-Jin Soon whose chemistry is much of what makes this series so incredible.The editing is some of the best I've ever seen in a movie or series as we are given scenes in one episode, only to realize that we were only given a partial look at the whole. Each time, we are given a joyful surprise and many, ""Ah-ha"" moments when we realize what really happened!Apparently North Korean defectors served as consultants on this series to try and make life in North Korea depicted as accurately as possible.Some might feel that the ending isn't the most ideal, but that's why I like it. It's realistic. They end up making the absolute most of the time that they have. These contrived, formulaic ""happy endings"" simply do not reflect life or relationships themselves.I have been watching movies and television series for over 45 years, and frankly, this series absolutely blew me away. It captured my imagination and my heart as I see a veritable ""Romeo and Juliet"" struggling to find ways to connect, love, and protect each other. They are such a short distance away from each other across the border, but as I stated before, the distance might as well be from the earth to the moon. I love stories about relationships, where the two people have to find a way to overcome the obstacles and pitfalls laid out before them. Two people with enough love and determination will always find a way. And that is why the joy of watching this series is in the journey and not the destination! And this journey was simply sweet, magical, and joyful. What more could you ask for in a great series?",10
"My wife and I watched this show and to say we were blown away is an understatement. One of the most powerful series we have seen in years, We were hooked from the beginning and not been so moved in a show for years! Hollywood could learn a lot from the people who made this.",10
"Why, yes, I did create an IMDb account just to review this series and give it a 10/10. I would give it even higher marks if I could!Crash Landing on You was the second Kdrama I watched. I instantly fell in love. The story, the cast, the acting, everything about it is perfect!The series portrays daily life in N. Korea with a human touch but without overly romanticizing it. The character development is excellent, not only for the main cast, but the supporting characters as well. From the main couple (BinJin 4ever!!!!), to Ri Jeong Hyeok's subordinates and the N. Korean villagers, everyone was a delight to watch. The series has a perfect blend of drama, romance, comedy, and action. It also has the wit to take jabs at typical Kdrama tropes in a fun, playful manner.And can we talk about BinJin? Wow. Hyun Bin and Son Ye-jin are AMAZING and their chemistry is out of this world. They are soooooooooooooooo good! You truly feel for Ri Jeong Hyeok and Yoon Se-ri. You cry when they cry and laugh when they laugh. Every scene they have together just makes you melt. This series made me fall in love with these two, especially Hyun Bin. I don't think there's any woman who didn't fall for Hyun Bin after watching this. I binged all his dramas and movies after and am at least $700 in the hole collecting the Japanese releases of his fan meeting DVDs and other media. I even joined his Japanese fan club! I never imagined learning Japanese would come in handy in this manner. I should've taken Korean too, haha. In short, I AM IN LOVE.If you're like me and can't get enough of these two, definitely check out their other work together, the movie The Negotiation (available for rent on Prime Video, YouTube, Apple TV). I truly came to respect the pair's acting abilities after this. The movie is nothing like CLOY and the characters are of course very, very different. Yet, they pull it off with perfection. And HB as a baddie is hawttttttt!I've recommended Crash Landing on You to several friends and they all loved it. I've watched a number of Kdramas since finishing this and I have to say that nothing has come close. CLOY is my gold standard. The rewatch value is great and the series is a perfect introduction to Kdrama.",10
"Best K drama , amazing chemistry and acting from the leads, entertaining from beginning to end, great story line and very well directed. The OST is outstanding just love every song they used in this drama. WOW for the cinematography!!! Son Ye Jin's acting should be recognized again coz she did an amazing job of portraying the character of Yoon Se Ri. Also want to give kudos to the supporting casts, they were all great! I have never done a review on a drama but after watching CLOY just wanted to acknowledge the great work of everyone responsible for creating this masterpiece. This drama has everything in it, it will make you laugh, fall in love, it will also make you cry a lot, it will make you realize the importance of having friends and family and it will make you experience a roller coaster of emotions. Please watch it and enjoy the show!!!",10
The best Korean series I've watched????????????????????????,10
"First ever K Drama I ever watched. And boy, it's so good.
More importantly, it shows the the life of North Korea which most of us are unaware of. Great chemistry and acting of two lead actors aptly supported by outstanding supporting casts.",10
"This is definitely my favorite kdrama ever! the chemistry between the two main actors is amazing, the story is interesting and original, and the acting is great. i was honestly really sad when the season ended, and i'm hoping for a season 2!!",10
"I haven't watched many K-dramas earlier and started watching this one on some recommendation.
I must say this series is worth every bit of your time, if you love romantic genre. It has a different and refreshing storyline, stellar performance from the entire cast, beautiful OST and many amazing moments.
The lead characters Ri Jeong Hyeok and Yoon Seri have convincing chemistry and they would make you believe that they are real life couples. The supporting cast especially 4 ducklings have also played their part perfectly.
The only bad thing which I feel is that once the show is over, you will think why it ended. Probably end of a good dream :)
Enjoy guys !!",10
"I had such fun watching this series. While the main plot of the budding romance between Captain Ri and Se-Ri did the job; they're both cute, charismatic and had chemistry. The real highlight of this series for me was the marvellous cast of supporting characters. They were so good that I've made notes:1. Solider squad: they are hilarious. The friendship! The banter! The loyalty! Special mentions go to Eun-dong (every time he cried out 'Captain Ri' or 'Se-Ri' in happiness, excitement or concern my otherwise dormant maternal instincts went feral) and Joo-Meok (an absolutely delightful dork).
2. Village girl gang: their relationship both during and after Se-Ri's time in the north was lovely. I love Kim Sun-young's acting; she makes me LOL.
3. Dan: ugh so glamorous, so dignified, eyeliner always on point. I love her.
4. Dan's mother, Myeong-run: What a legend. I really enjoyed her character development.In summary, it's ace; give it a crack.",9
"Don't let get thrown away by the first episode. It is just to introduce you to the story. Every episode gets better and better, exiting and intense. I think I might not have enough words to describe this show, so I might just call it an experience, a beautiful one of course.
I have recommend it to my friends and family and let me tell you none of whom have watched it was disappointed. So if you are considering watching it but are not to sure, just give it a try, be leave me, you are just going to love it!",10
How can something be so beautifully written and so amazingly acted at the same time? I have read a lot of other k drama reviews which say the best k drama ever and was disappointed after watching that. But THIS. IS. A. MASTERPIECE. I cried a river watching the last episode and I plan on crying a bit more watching it AGAIN and AGAIN..,10
"Once in a while, u come across a love story and wish the female lead is u.. But only in real life! I don't think guys in real life are actually this much loving, caring and everything perfect like showed in this drama but I would watch it 1000 times more and console myself cz IT'S WORTH WATCHING MULTIPLE TIMES",10
"Must must must watch. If only I had a guy who would care this much.. Love this much.. give me scheduled messages for 1 yr advance! Loved the storytelling, acting and literally everything about it. I m grateful to the entire team. I m longing for more k dramas like this!",10
"I decided to watch it because I liked the story of the series. I like the story and the flow, the subject processing style is good. I like acting for now, only one season has been released, I do not know if I will watch another season or not. The last note; The episodes were a little long, the latest episode, in particular, had little to do with it. I forgot to add; I wouldn't have guessed that a south korean drama would be so good, I usually see things that look interesting from south korea. It was also good not to focus on love.",8
"Don't get fooled by the title because this is a gem! Haven't enjoyed anything as much for such a long time. You get through all the emotions here. Laugh, cry, feel angry, smile as well as get attached to a lot of characters. The chemistry between the two main one is undeniable and kudos to the rest of the cast! The only negative thing is wondering, once you finish it, if something else will ever be this good... No doubt, this is a must!!",10
"The story is funny and emotional and sometimes also exciting. I really liked the first few episodes (good humor) and the development of the relationship between the main characters (in the beginning at least). I felt however that the chemistry between the main characters could have been better resp. Was not delivered. I also got bored by them halfway through the drama and was actually rather looking forward to seeing the secondary couple and their evolving relationship. Without the secondary characters (and here I mean the soldats, the women from the village and the other couple), I might not have finished the drama... although the scenery in Switzerland was so nice :) Gotta visit my own country next before going abroad #covid19",7
"I'm a bit of a North Korea watcher, and have watched and enjoyed several South Korean productions depicting life in the North, including JSA, the Crossing, Steel Rain and The Crossing. I tuned into this program knowing that it had glowing reviews, with considerable praise for its recreation of village life close to the DMZ. It is quite long, but does have quite a large cast of characters, and several plot-lines. Weirdly, it felt like a mash-up of A Mid Summer Nights Dream, JSA, and Crocodile Dundee!The main plot focuses on a Paris Hilton-type character, who endures a parasailing mishap, and ends up landing on the wrong side of the DMZ, where she is discovered by a North Korean soldier. She fleas the scene, but gets lost trying to find her way back across what would have to be the most dangerous border in the world. Turning up in a small village that seems completely alien to her, our damsel in distress is rescued by the hero of the piece, who decides to hide her and somehow find a way to return her to the south. Of course obstacles abound, and our spoilt heiress has to adapt to life in a small village, effectively hiding in pain sight. Before too long, dodgy elements of the local officialdom become highly suspicious of her, which threatens to create catastrophe for our hero and his influential father. Of course the two fall in love, and things gets rather dribbly from there.A subplot unfolds at the same time featuring a conman from the south (who has British citizenship) who fleas to the north to escape someone he ripped off (whom happen to be the brother of the ""Picky Princess."" In a round-about sort of way, he falls for another spoilt girl, who is betrothed to our hero, who clearly doesn't love her. Another subplot focuses on the family of our ridiculously rich girl, who are going all-out to win favour with Daddy, so that he might choose one of them to inherit his empire, replacing their missing sister, for whom they do very little to find when she goes missing.In the second half of the series, our Princess is safely back in the south, and is pining for soldier boy (forgive me for not using names) who similarly, is missing the woman he loves. The villain of the piece, who is caught out, sentenced and somehow escapes, fleas to the south in an attempt to seek his revenge of soldier boy by killing our girl. Fearing the repercussions that would have, soldier boy finds a way to sneak into the south in an attempt to stop the villain. When soldier boy's father finds out his son has gone south, he enlists the help of soldier boy's unit to go and retrieve his son, before the smelly brown stuff hits the fan.There's lots of drama, comedy, and of course romance, with the obligatory display of martial arts fighting (which was a bit silly, and reminded me of fight scene from the Matrix). There were also lots of coincidences, which were getting more far-fetched as the series unfolded. There was one coincidence (I can't say what it was for not wanting to spoil the show) which was a little too much. I didn't have a problem with what happened, it was where exactly it happened. I'll say no more on that.Overall, this was a well made show. I was especially impressed with the recreation of the North Korean village, as other reviewers have similarly commented. The cast did a fine job, (the group of village women were a hoot, as were the men in soldier boy's unit, and the villain was particularly good) and the production qualities were top notch. It was pretty gushy though, and would describe this series as the most Mills & Boon thing I've ever seen. It's on Netflix in Australia. Do check it out.",9
"A 10 for sure all acting was great however the leads Bin and Jin""s chemistry on screen was outstanding. A series that has it all, comedy, action and romance with beautiful scenery.
Definitely hoping for 2nd season.",10
"Ok, let's dont mention how Yoon Se-ri got to North Korea.. they called it paragliding mishap, i call it a complete sci-fi. But i suppose they needed to get her in there somehow. Other than that, for me CLOY is a masterpiece. Beautiful story of a selfless love and fellow friendship. A lot of chemistry between main leads, sacrifising one to save the other, although they only knew each other for a couple of weeks. I was also overhelmed by the parents' love for their son, it was a very lovely touch to the story. What i specifically liked though is how they portrayed north koreans, as kind and caring people (set aside politics).
What i didnt like was Ri Jung Heuk pouting :) an adult man should never pout (and i would like to think would never as well).
I hope to see more of Lee Shing-young in the future, he was indeed the most handsome one ;)",9
"Sometimes you just need a cheesy story, but this series transcents all romantic dramas. The acting, the storyline, the scenery, the perfect mix between humor, romance and drama. If you are in for a good drama, stop reading go watch it.",9
"I have already watched 3 Korean series (Itaewon Class, Extracurricular and CLOY), and I can say for sure that this series is the best of all 3. The characters are so lovely and funny. Yang Kyung-Won is a really great actor too. But the main story between Se-ri and Captain Ri is very, very beautiful. I have enjoyed so much the 16 episodes.",9
"I was pleasantly surprised by this show.
Very well made and the characters were magnificent. It made me laugh and cry sincerely. Also, that moment where they get separated at the borders is one of the best scenes I've watched in a series. So well presented and acted. It still gives me goosebumps. I really liked the ending as well. Recommended 10/10",10
"This story of a rich young South Korean woman that finds herself in North Korea by complete accident is an interesting one. Observing contrasts between the 2 cultures in a number of different ways is often a source of bewilderment and even humor. The central story, though, is a love story between the 2 main characters, the before-mentioned South Korean woman and a North Korean man. They, together, navigate through a number of troubles and crises of life-and-death nature. Quite exciting. As has been mentioned many times, they have a lovely chemistry. I can say that I find the main actress, Son Ye-Jin, absolutely adorable and beautiful. This entire series is stolen by her charisma in my humble opinion. Truly enjoyed watching this series.",8
"I opened this ID just to rate this drama 10/10. It has become my most favourite kdrama.
I think this drama hasn't achieved the amount of attention it deservers.
This drama will make you laugh, will show you sweet sincere romance and will make you cry.
Hyun-bin and Son ye-jin both played their role perfectly and has become my favourite couple.
Apart from Goblin it's the 2nd kdrama that made me cry my eyes out ??
If you're new to kdrama, be sure to keep ""Crash landing on you"" on your watch list.",10
"Let's be honest, the lead actress played by Ye-jin Son really carried the team on this one, her acting was very good but the lead actor played by Hyun Bin could barely give us more than two different facial expressions. I found it so frustrating looking at his same blank dumbfounded look the entire time when there could've been more emotions. The love scenes between these two were not intense enough on screen (it could be because if the blank looks?). The supporting actors played by Kim Jung-hyun (the con man) and Yang Kyung-won (loud soilder) were very well portrayed, captivating, and amusing to watch.
Overall, a good storyline, enough suspense and twists to be engaging, and some heart felt scenes relating to friendship and family love.
I much preferred the love story, romance and love scenes from the series Descendants of the Sun.",7
"This is a wonderful TV story with talented actors, an absolutely brilliant screenplay and one with a biting comedic take on North and South Korea and the frailties of human beings. I am watching it for the second time having just finished it the first time round. It is also poignant and sad at the same time as being hilariously funny. The writer of the series is someone to watch. I'm looking out for his/her other masterpieces.",10
Story not natural. Forcing the emotion too much. It's okay. Not bad series.,5
"Called ""Crash Landing on you"" on Netflix UKThis is described on IMDb as a romantic comedy. There's also a lot of action for folk who like a bit of action, including various chases and gun, knife and stick fights as well as hand to hand fighting.I was engaged by the first episode and addicted after the second episode.One of the things that I really like about this series is that it has a large cast, but each of the characters is clearly differentiated and interesting. Even characters with very minor parts, such as a chicken delivery man, have something distinct about them. This is really hard to do when you're working with so many actors and the writers and director should be congratulated on this, as should the actors for bringing the roles to life.This show is often very cheesy and playing on the heartstrings. But who cares, it's great fun. I really enjoyed the scenes with the North Korean soldiers and the North Korean village life. There was a great deal of charm and humour to be found in these scenes.It was interesting to see the perceptions that the North and South Korean characters were depicted as having about each other's countries and people. I don't know whether this is factually accurate or not but it made for some good dialogue.The only thing I didn't like was that at the end of some episodes there were previews of the next episode. For a moment you're not quite sure if this is part of the existing episode and so you end up seeing spoilers. This may just be a Netflix thing. You really have to have your wits about you when using Netflix. Another thing they do is to put their plot summaries on screen when you pause. Often these are huge spoilers rather than a description that just gives you a teaser.",10
I just finished this - my third ever KDrama and wow it is probably up there are one of my favorite TV shows of all time. It's SO BEAUTIFUL and lovely and masterful and precious and a show that will always remain beloved in my heart,10
"This is so funny and nice drama.i hope thoses actress are do them jobs very well.super lovely movie.but some sence are not allowed to real life......i made an ImBd account just to write a reviwe for this show.this show story line is brilliant.well done,,,,,,,,i rated 100000000000/10000000000000",10
"I haven't watched a KDrama before and was recommended this series by my fellow #AnnewithanE fans! They were not kidding when they said that this was a wonderful series. It's beautiful. The plot, script, support cast, the locations, music, every detail. Perfect. But the main reason it's magical is because of the absolutely magical chemistry on screen between Captain Ri and Se-Ri... Magic on screen!! I have to say the absolutely beautiful score is a gem. My tip is to watch it in the original Korean with subtitles if you are English speaking. Don't miss out on the beautiful performances of all the cast .... dubbing doesn't do it any justice!!!! Enjoy being enthralled by this beautiful story!",10
"If you want to watch a good romcom, then this one is the best romantic show in k dramas list where actors have done a very good job as well as the script is very well written.",10
"I have been watching Korean cinema for the last 12 years or so and Crash Landing is the best! I have watched it more than twice, sometimes rewinding and watching certain scenes over and over again... yet I want to watch it again. The two lead characters are exceptionally brilliant and so are all the others (in particular, the villian 'Gang').",10
"Tell me a genre that is absent here except horror, scifi and fantasy. Yeah, it is that kind of a drama. After laughing some times, you will feel thrilled and suddenly you will found yourself being sad and sometimes so romantic. That is how this drama progresses.Hyun bin and son ye jin were top notch as always. They are in top form even at this age.Storyline is superb. Songs are awesome. A rare perfect mixture of everything.Should watch it with high expectation and you won't be dissapointed for sure.",10
"Everything Is Just Perfect , It Will Sure Melt Your Heart.",10
"I've never scored a 10, but I decided WHY NOT? This series has everything I want in a TV series. It has a sound plot, believable motives, great chemistry between main actors, interesting character development, a bit of action, enjoyable setting and every episode ends on a cliffhanger. Episode 1 was not convincing (I thought oh no, a cheesy Asian drama) but after episode 3 I was hooked. Watched it with my sceptic husband and he loved it too. Will watch this series again.",10
Loved each and every character and fell in love with the couple in story. This is must watch in 2020 as this story never ends in negative and uplift mood and help us look forward to hope and faith in adverse conditions. More power to your whole team and hope to see new soon from your team,10
"Outstanding applause for all the elements in this drama series. The acting from each cast complements each other. The lead actor, Hyun Bin - is able to bring Captain Ri with such a charming persona because supports from a remarkable acting by Son Ye-jin as Yoon Se-ri, supporting actors/actresses from
Seo Ji-hye, Kim Jung-hyun, women in NK village, NK troops, until antagonist role by Oh Man-seok. They are all contribute a huge effort to bring this series into such an enjoyable & delicate show. My sincere congratulations to Ms Son Ye-jin who let us enjoy her various acting skills in both sadness & happiness :-).Furthermore is the sinematography, how each scene is beautifully framed, each detailed background is carefully crafted. Your eyes is spoiled from opening scenes in Switzerland, NK scenes into SK scenes and everywhere in between.One particular excellent work goes to music score. They are nicely put, beautiful pitch. Song for brother - the piano instrumental touch my heart deeply and I would often listen to it to seek for calmness energy.CLOY production team deserve an appreciation for their hard work. It's not easy to maintain such an emotion during prolong shooting process.I'm looking forward to see more awards for CLOY cast & crew. Koreans should be proud to have such a world-class drama series production. KUDOS!",9
Loved the cast loved the settings loved the chemistry and the great sense of humour throughout the show. Great soundtrack and score as well.,10
"I was obsessed with this show when I first watched it. It was my second k-drama and I couldn't believe how perfect this show was. I RAVED to everyone to watch it, but no one I know watches kdramas. Finally my mom, the least likely person to ever watch a subtitled tv show, tried it and also became hooked. She has told everybody she knows and gotten like 5 more couples she knows to watch it. If SHE likes it and can overcome subtitles, anyone can. She just finished it a second time and says it's the most perfect tv show ever made! I can't help but agree. Loved the acting, storyline, cinematography, everything. This is a real delight in the glum of 2020. Most kdramas haven't lived up to the bar this show set, but I'm realizing kdramas are way better than American tv, so get on board people! :)",10
"As far as a series goes, this came close to picture perfect. The writing is just so nuanced. I know some may find it overly romantic, almost soap operatic, but that misses the point. It's beyond clever. The acting is amazing. In a world where our differences do nothing but divide us, we need Se-ri and Ri Jeong Hyeok. This is the best thing I've watched since the quarantine started. And I've watched a TON of stuff. Highly recommended. And kids can totally watch this too.",10
"After watching several cookie-cutter Korean rom-com series I was getting tired of the genre. There's only so much same-old-cliche, cutesy, repetitious, hearing the same song over and over that one can take before moving to something a bit different.Then this was recommended to me and I gave it a look. This series brings the very best of Korean rom-com-drama. They did very well all through this series. While yes, it does stretch on a bit (the final episode is 2 hours long, the equivalent of a movie of itself)... the unique settings, diverse plot, non-standard personalities of the characters, and subplots make this well worth watching.It's not that it doesn't have some elements that were a bit over-the-top and excessively sappy... but those can be excused due to the unusually complex and interesting plot line and excellent work by the actors. There are parts where the dialog and acting is supposed to be excessive, and they do very well in those parts. Both lead actors show a wide range of talent in their parts, as do the supporting actors.There was a singular gratuitous use of MF in the English translation. I have to wonder if that was in the original language or just something the translators thew in there to be idiots. Either way it was lame and spoiled the moment.Other than that this series was excellent, and put K-coms back on my list of ""good stuff to watch"".",9
"I am not a die-hard fan of romance, but I have watched enough romance to know the cliches and common plots. Once in several years, comes a movie or a series that gets you hooked onto your seat cherishing every single melodramatic moment, immersing you in the taut plot where you simply don't want it to end. ""Crashlanding On You"" is one such perfect drama. It ticks all the right boxes from crackling chemistry of the protagonists, gorgeous cinematography, catchy background score and lilting tunes to memorable side characters, brilliant editing and the ideal mix of fiction and real issues. A cross-border love of a North Korean army man and a South Korean chaebol enterpreneur is all you need to bingewatch this weekend and feel all the emotions within you. It will definitely remain one of my most favourite romantic stories of all time. :)",9
"I am a bit disappointed watching this series since I have high hope towards this series cos I love Hyun Bin very much and Park Ji Eun is one of the best writer so far.The storyline is too simple for 16 episode drama, it could have been fit to 4 episode, even can fit into a 2.5 hours movie. I find the story is so boring that I couldnt finish it and I gave up on 11th episode.Compared to previous Park Ji Eun project (ie. My Love from The Star), the story was too plain. The acting is good, the cast is good, the biggest weakness here is the plot.I dont understand about the hype of its drama, but nothing I can relate towards this drama message to its viewer. Its just typical romance story.",5
"This was my first Korean drama, and I was very surprised to see how well they make movies. It's the most amazing show I've seen on TV (I've seen mostly Filipino and Mexican telenovelas). Story is unique and interesting...for the first time I saw North Koreans being portrayed as normal people with feelings, emotions, humor and capable of love. Every character was interesting and well developed; I loved each one of them. Acting is superb, especially by the four main characters. I laughed and cried with them, because I really felt the emotions that they showed on screen. It's a wonderful experience watching this show (so wonderful that I decided to watch it 4x). I recommended to everyone who reads this to WATCH THIS SHOW, and you will not regret it!",10
"Everybody should spend sometime and watch couple of episodes to get addicted and start watching till the end. True love story with family concepts and lot of ""indigestible truths"", I mean simple things of our life which really matters and that we are used to leave behind.",10
"Clean content . Shot at nice locations.
Love and suspense in all episodes",9
There are uninteresting characters and scenes I only enjoyed watching the captain comrades and the lead role.,8
"It is the first kdrama I watched and it changed my attitude towards kdramas.After that I watched a lot k-series. It is the best romantic series I watched . It makes you laughf, cry , heartbroken. The main reason for the success of the series is the chemistry between both of them. The supporting characters where also done a great jobe. Each episode is 80min+ long but I didn't get bored for a single episode. It has beautiful background score and shooting location were beautiful. It's an masters piese and I am going to watch it again. I strongly recommend to give a try and I am sure I will fall in love with the series.PLOT
Crash landing on you had a simple story but the exicution of the story makes it great. Crash landing on you tells the story of two people Yoon Se-ri, a South Korean fashion entrepreneur and Ri Jeong Heyeok is a north korean special forces caption One day while she paragliding a tornado knocks her out to north Korean. When she wakes up she is in north Korean border where she met Jeon Heyok . He helps her secretly back to her country. They fall in Love between than time. I can't say any more you should watch the rest.",10
"Makes you feel good and makes you emotional at numerous times.
The friendship and loyalty apart from the lovestory are worth a watch.",9
"I've watched this show twice (not something I often do). I've never encountered a series where I switched between crying and laughing so effortlessly. I'm also glad that I watched it again, because the first time around I only realised after episode 5 that there is an explanatory epilogue after the supposed ""ending"". There is usually a conclusion with a set of freeze frames, so it's easy to mistake that as the actual end and wonder why Netflix doesn't realise it as well. Although these epilogues are sometimes a continuation of a previous scene with more revealing information, they often supply important backstory information. So make sure you watch until the start of the credits.CLOY is about successful South Korean businesswoman Yoon Se-ri, played by Son Ye-jin, who accidentally ends up in North Korea after going paragliding during a freak storm. She meets Captain Ri Jeong-hyeok, played by Hyun Bin, and after several mishaps they're stuck with each other while trying to get her home safely. If the two main characters were not from powerful and privileged families, the story would probably have ended in episode one with a gunshot, but this is about survival against all odds. Both Se-ri and Jeong-Hyeok have had to deal with trauma in their past, and this adds a deeper dimension to their characters and relationship. The story is strongly supported by the other main and secondary characters, who are easy to sympathise or identify with.The series doesn't have an idealistic or simplistic solution for the tragic division between North and South Korea, but it does make you think a lot about geopolitics, divisions and hypocrisy. CLOY will one way or another stay in your thoughts, even if you just watch a few episodes, or missed the epilogues!",10
"Till the 11th episode, i loved it. new story, funny moments, cute, somehow thrilling lovestory, i liked them so much. but after that, it was all cliché and slogan. so 7 out of 10 seems fair.",7
Can't get over this drama..the more I watch the more lovely it becomes..almost watching some part or the other..the cast is absolutely favvv and in love with the leads..(hyun bin and yi jin son)... The best korean drama ever...CLOY..,10
"Perhaps the story has been told before, but I was riveted by every moment of this drama / thriller / comedy / romance. It was a perfect blend of those elements, alternating deftly between them to serve the story and characters; after a dramatic scene comes some comedy relief to relieve tension, and then a tear-inducing romantic revelation. Every emotion is earned and emerges organically from the characters and the story they are immersed in. It is rare that I've been so affected by a drama like this, and that's good; I don't think my heart can take it.",10
"Its the typical rom-com full of clichés but the setting of the story is good and heartwarming. The love story between the main leads are very classic. Although I have to admit the plot is kind of dragging, I stayed because of the four cute and funny soldiers ??Overall, it is a good drama to watch to fill in your free time. If you love typical rom-com dramas with clichés then this drama is for you.",7
"Every episode is a master piece. I thoroughly enjoyed every frame. Comedy, romance, action and thriller combo.Feel good series.",10
This show is so good. It is the best. The chemistry between the two main characters and everyone in general is perfect. Mr. Ri is mysterious and quiet but actually makes you want to cry. I watched this show in three days and will probably watch it again. You yet can't stop watching! It is a little dramatic at some parts but it just adds to the tension. Please watch this show you will be hooked and won't regret it.,10
"I can not express how much I love this show!!! The way Mr. Ri acts make ""my heart flutter""! I am obsessed!! I would 100000000% recommend!! This is what a romance needs to be like. It makes you yearn for more!! It's actually funny and sweet, but also serious and perfectly executed! I love all the characters and the way it is translated to English is gives me quite a laugh! I actually can't stop thinking about it! If you love fantasizing about crazy circumstances and love this is a dream come true! Gah my heart!!!!!!!
If I could I would give this a 47/10!!!!",10
"This is a beautiful love story of no matter where you are, destiny speaks volume.
This is the first KDrama that I've finished. Thankful for this series, made me introduced to another KDramas and no they are my happy pill.Highly recommend this series. Hyun Bin and Son Ye Jin are perfect for this show. You'll fall in love with them. The comrades as I call them are the best, the loyalty and friendship speaks volume. You'll see the contrast between South Korea and North Korea. There are aspects in North Korea that are heartwarming and vice versa.I love the location in Switzerland, oh what a beautiful site.",10
"I was surprised to see this drama's high ratings.
I'm writing this message hoping that other non-Koreans will be alert.
It can be fun to watch the content itself. But I hope non-Koreans watch this drama and do not think that the reality of North Korea will be the same as this drama.
I first heard the plot of this drama and tried to watch it, but I was curious because it was popular with people at the time of the show.
If you think the genre of this drama is fantasy, everything will be interesting.
However, I am worried that non-Koreans who watched this drama will think that all the contents of this drama are true.
The background of North Korea is not true at all.
Do you really think North Koreans will live like that?
North Korea has no religious freedom because it considers The Kims as God.
Pyongyang is home to the top 1% of North Korea's powerful people, and other areas are like dead land.
The drama is so beautiful that The Kims should thank Hyun-bin and the drama producers.
More than you think, North Koreans are brainwashed by The Kims.
Drama is drama.
For your information, the odds of you falling into North Korea while paragliding are lower than the odds of you winning the lottery.
If the genre of this drama is fantasy, I don't blame you even if you give this drama 10 rating.
Don't forget all the actors and actresses including Hyun-bin are South Korean. DO NOT HAVE A FANTASY ABOUT NORTH KOREA.",1
"I was slightly sceptical starting watching this show, however the plot and scrip are amazing as well as their acting. I have never watched a spontaneous, natural and well-done romance between the lead roles. All in all, it is a must watch.",10
"This show would be so good if the main characters weren't so blatantly stupid. Minor tweaks to the storyline would have made it a great show. For example, if you expect a military caption to try staunch the wound of someone who has just been shot, rather than cry over their body looking around for help like a helpless child. If multiple people are trying to kill you, you don't return to your house and chill out for an evening. These plot holes are so so easy to fix. But in the end it was just insufferable. I don't think I'll watch another Korean drama now, this has put me off them completely.",2
"...get over this now? Words can not describe how beautiful this was. Everything: the comedy, the action, the story behind, the chemistry between the characters (not only the two main)... For me it was the most beautiful thing I ever saw in my life.",10
"I have never expected this drama to be STRAIGHT UP PERFECTION!!!!!
The story line was sooooooo amazingggggg !!! Omg I swear it's definitely a must watch !!!!
Beautiful story.. amazing cast... the setting was so so so perfect.. straight up 10/10
No jokes ! Absolutely worth watching ! Each and every single episode is perfection !!!",10
I just didn't like the ending but the whole drama was super good. They showed mature but innocent love story. Hats off to the story writer. It's really a good drama.,10
"This romance story is set in that place. That place we wish we can save people from. It was really hard to see what we know and choose to ignore. What hurt so much about this series is that I knew it was near to impossible for the main characters, who were from North and South Korea, to be together. It feels so stupid in this time age that people can't be together because of nationality but this alone will be enough to break every part of you but more will come that will weigh even more on you. Those invisible shackles that people from North Korea must live through, in this series, you'll see it all. Thank you so much for this series and I hope to god that Korean will unite so the suffering at least lessen of those living in the north.",9
Why don't the Koreans kiss more in their movies etc,3
"This drama is everything you want and more. No better way to put it. First of all the cast is about as good as it gets. Son ye-Jin is gorgeous, hyun bin looks fine, but to have someone as stunning as Seo hi-hye as a supporting cast and the villain as oh man seok who just killed his role is just too good to be true.First of all the ye-Jin has a lively and humorous personality and she keeps us engaged every times she in the scene. Hyun bin is more cold and calculated as a officer should be but his buddies that work in his battalion provide that level of comedic relief and depth that takes this drama to another level . Just love the whole group. The drama starts off in North Korea and then just as you think it's going to slow down when Ye-Jin returns to her lavish life back in South Korea it picks right back up and continues in South Korea as well.Just the perfect kdrama that all types of people can watch and enjoy.",10
"I am a big cinephile, but never written any reviews on social forum . After watching CLOY I felt like I should start with this masterpiece!
This series is perfect in every possible way, starting from story, writing, production design, music, editing, direction, casting etc etc ..I can just go on and on.
Lead actors are so talented and the chemistry is just fantastic. Ye son Jin is absolutely gorgeous and her cute expressions will stay with you for a long time.
The entire supporting cast are also amazing.
This romantic drama is one of the best I have ever seen and it's 16 episodes of absolute delight .
This is my first Kdrama, didn't have much expectations but I was hooked like crazy and ended up watching 4 other Kdrama in really short time. Koreans are really experts in making Romantic dramas. I know it now.
CLOY will stay with you for a very very long time and bring a smile on your face whenever you think about it. Just go ahead and watch it....I'm sure you will end up watching it again :)",10
"Is good, maybe is long, it's perfect with 10 episodies",9
Best Show ever IMO!!! Loved the chemestry between the lead actors. Great story.,10
"This drama was well done from the acting to the cinematography to the writing. I personally think the Seri's acting was outstanding! One issue I had was that some of the epilogue scenes got too cheesy for me. In addition some of the side plots were a little bit too long, however it is understandable since they were trying to show the differences between the North and South. THE CHEMISTRY also between the two couples were electric! This drama was definitely worth the hype.",8
"Exceptional is an understatement. This drama the reason why I have become a Kdrama fan. With the hundreds of Kdramas I've seen since, no one can match this drama yet for me. From main cast to supporting and extras, eveyone just did great. The visual of the drama is very beautiful too. Romance, drama, comedy, action and suspense all in one, superb! And did I mention how beautiful Son Ye Jin and her exceptional and verstatile acting in the drama as always? Love her!",10
"One of the best shows I've seen in a long time, it was perfect! The actors and the main characters are just so funny and so good, it feels so real, every episode and every emotion. You are going to laugh and cry together with them, I just love it! It has action, drama, romance and comedy. Such a heart welming and such a kind show.",10
"This series was not really what I had expected. It turned out to be basically a soap opera, albeit partly in an unusual setting. Sixteen 80-90 minute long episodes was way, way too much to tell this story. The subplots, especially the one with Jeong-hyeok's brother, were not very interesting. Combined with too much Korean over-the-top style acting in some parts, it gets a bit dull after a while.The show can be divided into two parts: The first half in North Korea, and the second in South Korea. The show is essentially over once Se Ri is back in South Korea, but at that point we still have 7 episodes, or roughly 10 hours, to go.The first half is without a doubt the best, a solid 9. The second half could easily be summarized in one 90 minute episode, because it's painfully drawn out with plenty of slow motion romantic shots and cheesy Korean ballads blaring repeatedly, with a score of 4-5. In the end, a combined score of 7 is quite generous considering the second half which is quite a slog to get through.The pair in the lead are good. The character which turned out to be the most interesting, Seo Dan, isn't given a whole lot to do.It was interesting to see a portrayal (realistic or not) of daily life in North Korea, in the city as well as the countryside. One thing I liked in particular is that the North Koreans were portrayed as humans, and not mindless automatons.I travelled around in North Korea a few years ago, and some of the exteriors of Pyongyang were spot on (like the view from Kim Il Sung square of the Taedong river with the Juche tower in the background), others were not, especially Pyongyang at night. The fictional international hotel in the show is clearly meant to represent Koryo Hotel (where I stayed), judging from the exterior (although it's missing a skybridge). The interior however looks nothing like the real thing.6-8 episodes which focused on the actual story would have been perfect.",7
"Wow lots of love for this series. I suppose once Netflix started to carry KDs it is not surprising this series got great votes. The production is good, chemistry between the 2 main characters are there in spades, but for me Goblin, Weight lifting fairy series of KD are more memorable. Catch those too if you can.",7
"This show is my first korean tv series. There are a lot of haters on here talking about North Korea. I for one didn't click on this show looking for cold hard facts on North Korea, historical accuracy of the political tensions, or the feasibility of accidentally falling over there. What I did come for is the entertainment, and this shows got it. It's funny, it's sad, and it's got great production!",10
"Awesome storyline, character bonding. A perfect love story!",10
"I've been watching Kdrama's for a couple years now and they've really opened my eyes to a different world. I've seen a lot of them now and this was easily my favorite series. It is so beautifully written and acted. These are true professionals. The scenery was breathtaking. This story has so much love, lots of comedy at just the right times. I adored watching the wives in the North. They were such a funny group of friends. The military group of men were equally as funny. Each personality of the men really came through and all put together it was awesome to watch. I really enjoyed watching the different customs between the North and the South, even if some of it wasn't true to life. It really fascinates me to watch since our customs are so different. Even the action scenes and bad guys seemed so real and lots of fun to watch. The love story in this touches your soul. I haven't seen a gut wrenching love story where there are so many obstacles keeping them apart since Bridges of Madison County. I never cry watching a series and I absolutely cried many times in this and as the series started to come to an end I didn't want it to stop. I was counting down the episodes. The song he plays on the piano will forever be in my heart and on my phone. ;) I will definitely recommend this to anyone. I'll be watching it again for sure.",10
"The story line is very predictable, very boring, almost nothing much really happens through out the entire series.. poor performance from the lead male and female starts.. no chemistry what so ever between the leads.. unnecessarily long episodes.. very boring long conversations.. I think this drama could have ended in 5 or 6 episodes max.. but anyway the rest of supporting actors did a great job that's why I give it six",4
"I must admit it took me the first 2 episodes to fully get into this show, but from that point on I was ALL IN! Crash Landing On You is one of the best K-drama's I have ever watched, only second place to Guardian.Everything was on point- the acting, the characters, the storyline, the scenery. I'm truly lost for words. I finished watching the show less than a week ago and I'm having massive withdrawals. There were so many great moments- ones I laughed way too hard at and watched repeatedly, ones I cried for ages to, and many more.Anyone wanting to get into the genre, this is one I'd definitely recommend! Way better than anything you watch on American tv these days.",9
"This was the first korean drama I've been able to get into and it blew me away completely. Definitely the best television show made in the past 12 months. If you like romance, action, suspense, drama, and empathetic story telling then this is the show to watch.",10
Best series i watched in a really long time. Their chemistry is no joke. It awesome !!!!,10
"This drama is so amazing. Everything about this drama is so perfect. Love the chemistry between capt ri and seri, it was so natural. At first, I wasn't interested at all to watch K drama but my friend asked me to watch it and bang, I watched the first episode and can not stop. I just finished it in 3 days.",10
"Very interesting to watch as entertainment, but not repeatedly. once was enough.",8
"I really really loved this show! I watched it in like 3 days and I've never cried so much at a show. Genuinely very good story, amazing actors, and a great ending. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone. Please please do yourself a favor and watch it, you won't regret it!",10
"This series, available on Netflix, is the finest available worldwide!! It has everything: great acting, deceit, machinations, pathos, comedy, intense action scenes and a heart-rending love story. I agree with all the reviews that gave this ten stars. Everyone who has Netfix worldwide is watching it has watched this show. Everyone I talk to has said the same thing: I LOVE THIS SHOW!!!",10
"My first attempt to watch Korean drama, I commend the lead actors for a believable acting and great chemistry. . No sex and no nudeness involve but will still shake your core. I felt every feeling, I laughed, I cries, giggled, and I can't get enough of it! I am hoping they will reunite this two if they can't make a season 2. Out of this world, You will want to fall in love all over again.",10
This show never failed to put me in a better mood everytime I watched it.,9
"If you're looking to see what true, real love and dedication/effort is, then this is the show for you. Will never forget.",10
"This was the first ever Korean Drama I ever watched and to be honest after watching this show I was speechless. Absolutely AMAZING. Each scene is memorable and beautiful. I loved the writing and I loved the acting of Hyun Bin and Son Ye-Jin. AMAZING chemistry. I really wish there would be a season 2 :( - Of course our two main characters stole the show however it was much more than this. Each and every character played a remarkable role (The comrades, The family members, The village Ajummas) - All together this was a 10/10 drama. It is a must watch. I am definitely going to give this another watch from the start some day because like a said, each scene is 10/10.",10
"No spoiler, I will just say I fell in love with this movie.
Maybe bec also remind me a bit of my past",10
"One of the best TV series I have ever seen. And I have seen most of them so I know where to set the bar. A fantastic production. Gorgeous photography and atmospheres. The show is an exciting combination of an ever evolving love story, humor and cold action. It is a story that brings hope and unites people, finding the common good human denominators in ourselves no matter if we come from North- or South Korea. The chemistry between main actors is so engaging and authentic. The story is engaging and fascinating. Everything is perfect and you never want it to end. What more is there to say? In one word: perfection. You just have to watch this brilliant show. Enjoy!",10
Just loved the show ..every bit of it ...not even a place where you get bored ... Just watch the first episode ...aft that there's no stopping you ....need to say the chemistry between the two were brilliant ...need a find a word ...it's Soo soooo awesome.....loved it ... Cried and laughed along with the characters ... The emotions in every scene is captured very well and love scenes are ..man ....must watch show I can say .....overall I loved every bit of the show ...really fell in love with the heroine ...Yoon se-ri <3,10
"Very typical Korean production: Male & female become love interests; usually from very different backgrounds. Usual emphasis on attractiveness in actors. Usual emphasis on wealth. Usual parent and/or offspring conflicts. Typical confrontational style behavior (is this a Korean behavior norm?) Very predictable ending.Movie starts out with a very cheap CGI of a tornado (especially the whirling farm tractor), and very fake sucking of hang glider into it; surviving completely intact (a little dirt makeup). The worst part was the script's downplaying of North Korea's totalitarian control of it's people. Besides being poorly educated; fed the same propaganda for memorizing; facing imprisonment or death for voicing an opinion (also Russia & China in that cadre); using it's resources to maintain the military while ignoring the feeding & health of it's people. The script, probably for political reasons, whitewashed all of that while portraying most of the North as kind & thoughtful of others.",3
"Wow, what a refreshing, clean, romantic and educational drama. I went to YouTube and watched the main actors interviewed over and over.Beautiful love story, as many Korean dramas are, without having to rely on violence, corruption, drugs and so on. So fresh. I will watch it again in a year to develop a feeling of love consciousness.",10
"How can two grown and scarred adults fall in love against their better judgment? But they do, and this this is a story of pure and selfless love... But it's so much more: The personal growth of some of the secondary characters is something uncommonly well done. The OST, scenery and production quality are beyond the charts. (And all of that, without goblins) It's a pity that I had to wait half a lifetime to find a romantic show of this quality.",10
"Everything is perfect. The actors and actresses, the story and director, everything. The actors who played lead roles, the first and second male and female leads, and other actors who played North Korean roles nailed it. Really felt sad, when Gu jeun dong died . Also big shout-out to the music director for amazing background scores. ?????",9
"I normally don't like to watch series. I prefer movies that start and end within 2 hours max. But when I saw my wife and daughter hooked on this series, I decided to give it a try... I got hooked. The plot is amazing, the acting is top notch... not the usual Hollywood bang bang with guns and blood. A beautiful love story with two incompatible individuals. I loved it. I recommend it for everyone... don't miss it. A true masterpiece.",10
This is drama that brings me so much emotions..I cried few times. Love it <3,10
"What's most incredible is that Hyun Bin and Son Ye-Jin fell in love in real life! ! ! !Haengbokhaseyo??????Perfect and touching acting????????????
Marvelous OST??????
Warm and humble lifestyle????",10
"I loved this drama, all actors did a great job in producing a great fun romantic drama. I really enjoyed the storyline, the outcome was good and acceptable, as always, we always wish for more. Yes its worth watching.",9
I have never watched a series that made me feel this way. From the plot to the actors everything was just perfect and so touching.,10
"I dont even know how to start. AMAZING. The acting is so good. You can feel the chemistry between the two main characters. It was so real that now that chemistry turned into a real relationship. Anyways when watching the first few minutes of it, i thought it was something not for me, but i thought wrong. Its very funny as well. Highly recommend",10
"Yes this production really is THAT good! I can't even call it a series because it's more like an amazing group of consecutive films. My mom and I binged this in 3-4 days, missing lots of sleep because we could not stop watching. We HAD to keep going, it wasn't even a choice.
I'll have to admit, this was my first Korean romance series! We needed a break from the tense political news & wanted to watch something we could escape to. After the first episode, I was not sure what to think as it was a bit slow. But after that first episode, things pick up and completely submerse you. It's everything all wrapped up into one: romance, drama, thriller, suspense, comedy. The acting is so amazing!!!! I'm in awe of this wonderful production. I laughed in the beginning & middle, while I cried and gasped in the last half. Watch all the way until the end, you'll love it! It's an intense journey of love, family, cultural difference, friendship and community. I'm praying and PRAYING for a season two!!",10
"One of the best drama series I've ever seen! All of the actors were outstanding and all had amazing chemistry! An absolute must watch, so heart wrenching and heart warming..",10
"If you're looking here to find encouragement to watch this show... don't look further than all the 10/10 reviews you see. I've had an IMDb account for years and I never wrote any reviews. Well this is it. This show pushed me through so many emotions I can't find words to explain them. It's beautiful, sad, joyous, devastating but ultimately... heartfelt. You will cry tears of sadness and heartbreak but the tears of joy will leave the biggest print. Watch it. The actors don't only bring the characters alive, they live through them and bring the masterpiece the writers created for us to see. You won't regret it.",10
"I can only say this series was flawless. Direction, location, music, story. And the actors -- leads and supporting were superb. I will probably add this to films and series that are my go to for feel good entertainment.",10
Brilliantly executed and absolutely keeps audience captivated.,10
"Back in early 2020 I came across this drama as it kept coming up on Netflix. I was immediately hooked and in fact this started my love for dramas! This is a must watch - there is a mix of romance, comedy, drama...it made me go through all sorts of emotions (be prepared for tears!). There was great chemistry between the leads - Son Ye Jin and Hyun Bin, who are now an actual couple now (announced in Jan 2021) - I love them so much. Perfect cast, perfect story, perfect script! You will want to watch it over and over again!",10
"9/10 is my rating. This is a 2019/2020 South Korean television drama with 16, 70-110 minute episodes.Yoon Se-ri (Son Ye-jin) has lived the life of a Princess as a chaebol heiress to one of the largest conglomerates in South Korea. She is the only daughter and has always been somewhat of a black sheep leading her to form her own successful fashion sporting goods line. She has two older brothers who would be the logical successors to her father, however, he does not feel like his sons have what it takes to run the business. He announces his plan to have his daughter, Se-ri, run the company when he retires and plans to announce it at the next shareholder meeting. Se-ri is excited to have proven herself and vows to wrap up her own business and put it under management with just one final campaign. To test a flight suit she goes paragliding in Seoul and a freak weather event, with tornadic winds, blows her off course into North Korea's portion of the demilitarized zone. Having lived a pampered life she does not, at first, realize how dangerous the situation she has found herself in is. As luck would have it, she is discovered on patrol by Ri Jeong-hyeok (Hyun Bin) who is from a powerful North Korean family and is serving as a Captain in the Korean People's Army. Unlike Se-ri he knows all too well what might happen if she was turned in to the North Korean military police. After some reluctance he decides to protect her and help her get back to South Korea. Meanwhile, Se-ri's family, particularly her brothers, assume her dead, and began competing for the role of their father's successor. When they find out Se-ri is alive by chance, they conspire to keep her from returning to South Korea. Meanwhile Jeong-hyeok has been trying to solve the mystery surrounding his brother's death and winds up with an enemy in common with Se-ri who is determined to expose them both. Although Jeong-hyeok is engaged to a North Korean heiress, there is no love in the arrangement, and he finds himself drawn to Se-ri and she to him.
spoilers*. I like the glimpse into North Korean life that this show gives. It illustrates how people all over the world are very much the same in that we want good things for our kids, to have loving friends, and see the people around us happy and healthy. In the beginning, when the female lead first landed in North Korea I liked how they did not immediately befriend her but had a debate about what to do with this person who was possibly an enemy. It felt like they went through the same type of discovery and found that they had fewer differences and more similarities. I liked all the young military men and how loyal they were to each other and to their captain. I thought it was interesting how she found a way to fit in with the local women and came to be friends with them. The male leads fiancé and him were in an arranged marriage and it was interesting to see the conflict as he started to fall in love with someone. It also delved into love versus obsession and there was a lot of character growth on all of their parts. The female lead started as a spoiled and ""Picky Princess"" but she learned through being around people that had so much less than she did yet still found ways to enjoy life and each other that she did not need all those things she had back in South Korea. I thought the way her family had very little love between them as they were too busy fighting for control of the company showed the way when the focuses is on the material a lot of the joyous things in life are lost. I would've scored this even higher but I was, unlike a lot of people, disappointed in the ending as I thought they might find a way to be together either her going to North Korea or him defecting to South Korea. I thought perhaps there was an angle with her being rich and them wanting her money as the father had mentioned. It turned out in the end that they were only able to be together in SwitzerlandJust a couple weeks out of the year. I was also disappointed that the side couple never got to be together because he wound up dying around the time he finally came around and redeemed himself. I still feel like it is Netflix influence that makes it so the females in these act as if they don't need a man in their life. That is a very modern Western concept. I know some people would say there are families that live that way and that is considered a normal type of ending or at least one possible ending. To me I watch stuff not to see the harsher parts of life play out, I like the happily ever after stories as I think life is hard enough as it is. Still it was very good and very well written with excellent actors. The chemistry between the couples was very believable and the friendships were heartwarming. I highly recommend this to anyone that wants a glimpse into North Korean lifestyle as I understand there were many North Koreans who provided information and insight for the script so while it is still a movie and not entirely based on facts a lot of the major elements such as power outages, house searches, and a lack of technology for most people I understand accurately portrays life for many North Koreans.",9
"My wife never wanted to watch a show twice, but after we finished watching CLOY we immediately started all over again. We laughed and cried all over again. We felt like we were part of the story all over again. It is just perfect. It will be forever our favorite show of all time.",10
"I have been won over to Korean drama by Mr Sunshine and then by this very moving romantic comedy thriller. I would rank these two series as the best thing I have seen on television in years.Crash Landing on You builds up such an emotional head of steam, driven by the predicament in which the leads find themselves and great central performances. Son Ye-Jin and Hyun Bin are both perfect. The final episode is simply sublime.If only western dramas could rediscover the power of story telling and forget the mandatory inclusion of gratuitous sex and bad language.",10
"My friends keep talking about this and after seeing such good ratings I decided to try. Honestly I still gave it the time until episode 5. My god this show is boring. Like the episodes are wayyyy too long and dull.
I love romantic stories but if this is what it's about then it's just plain boring.
Do not understand the hype.",3
"Let me say, first, that this is a really, wonderful K-Drama, but it's not my favorite. It is up there in my top 5, though.The writing and the cinematography are excellent, but the very best part about this series are all the extremely lovable characters.Worth the watch.My top 10 are, as follows:
1. It's OK to Not Be OK
2. Mr. Sunshine
3. Start-Up (2020)
4. Rookie Historian
5. Crash Landing On You
6. The King:Eternal Monarch
7. Cheese in the Trap
8. A Korean Odyssey
9. DoDoSolSolLaLaSol
10. One Spring Night
Sorry, had to add an eleventh...
11. Strongest Deliveryman
Honorable mentions: ""My Holo Love,"" ""Strangers from Hell,"" ""Vagabond,"" ""The K2,"" ""Something in the Rain,"" and, ""Cinderella and the Four Knights.""Currently watching, ""My Sassy Girl"" and ""The Uncanny Counter,"" which I'm totally enjoying!
If I left out any of YOUR favorites, I probably haven't gotten around to them, yet.",8
"Everything about this drama is just wow! The acting, scenery, plot and especially the OST (probably listened to this more than I'd dare to admit). The whole ""paragliding accident"" can seem a little far fetched, but the story really really evolves from that. Cried like a baby during the last episode and will probably need some time to emotionally recover from this show. Don't think I've ever watched something that would get to me this much, being able to portray such a powerful love story without a single sex scene, just wow.",10
"This was the second Korean series I had watched from start to finish and since the first one was Sky Castle (which is also very good, by the way), this was my first romantic K-drama. Lots of K-dramas are now available for streaming, so it is easy to watch them.The plot is actually quite complex and the episodes very long, with plenty of time for character and story development. The production seems pretty high budget, with an (almost) high budget film-like quality.The basic premise of the story (Chaebol princess accidentally lands in North Korea when paragliding) is quite silly, so my recommendation is that you should watch at least two episodes before deciding whether you like it. The romance element is quite important, but I think the series might also appeal to people who are otherwise not that much into romantic stories, due to the North Korean angle. Most of the story takes place in North Korea, with lots of North Korean characters and a very interesting, nuanced portrayal of life and people there. I've read that the producers used North Korean defectors as consultants when developing the story. The portrayal of North Korea is said to be somewhat idealized, although there are lots of negative things depicted (informants who spy on ordinary people, frequent power cuts, etc.). Actually, what is very interesting is that North Korea is portrayed as a fairly modern country that has changed a lot, with some elements of market economy (with thriving black markets selling all kinds of South Korean products and the relatively lavish lifestyle of rich people there), while also being more traditional than South Korea in many ways (for example, due to the unreliable electricity supply, people still store kimchi in the traditional way, under the ground). The North Korean characters are quite nuanced and multi-layered, too, with the exception of the villain, who is just plain evil (by the way, he is played by a good-looking, charismatic actor). My favourite character is the North Korean girl's, Dan's mother, who is just hilarious.Talking about humour, it seems that K-dramas tend to have comic relief characters even if the subject is serious. The comedy mostly comes from these characters yelling and hitting each other, which can be irritating, but in this series, there are also examples for more subtle humour, e.g. when the otherwise perfect North Korean captain (the male lead) is shown to be quite vain or childish. There is a very cute scene where the female protagonist restricts his time on the computer because he gets too hooked on online gaming.The male and female leads have very good chemistry (it comes as no surprise that they are a couple now in real life, too). Hyun Bin, the actor who plays the North Korean soldier, is a handsome, masculine and charismatic guy, but his character is such a perfect gentleman and so reserved here that he seems a bit slow on the uptake. The female protagonist seems to be a spoiled, entitled woman at the beginning, then slowly becomes more complex. Son Ye Jin seems to be a good actress and she is pretty, too (although the actress playing the North Korean girl is much more beautiful, in my opinion). I really enjoyed the romance, although it could have been much better. First, it was not shown why the two characters were drawn to each other (except for the story of having met years before, which was a bit over the top). There were no scenes with them flirting, having a good time or having interesting conversations. It was all about them disliking each other first, then all of the sudden falling in love and making sacrifices for each other. For sure, chemistry can be more than enough for a love story, but, at least for a person used to American/European films and series, the complete lack of physical intimacy/passion seemed strange. Considering that the two protagonists are in their thirties and single, there was no allusion even to touching, let alone making out or having sex, even though they spend weeks or even months living together and being head over heels in love. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that there should necessarily be sex scenes, which are probably awkward for actors, anyway, I'm talking about an almost complete lack of intimacy, except for one or two chaste hugs. The very few kisses with pressed lips (like in American movies from the 1950's) are as sexy as this romantic series gets. There is another cute scene where he is showing her his scars at the hospital, but it doesn't go anywhere, either. I'm guessing the main target must be more conservative Asian audiences. However, what is lacking in intimacy and passion is amply 'compensated' by the obtrusive, cheesy love songs that start to play very loudly every time the two protagonists are together (even while talking!). There is also a secondary love story between the North Korean girl and a South Korean guy, also played by cute actors, but I had the same problems with this love affair, too (at least here, the guy was trying to flirt).",8
"This is a first class show with two well known actors; Hyun Bi as ""Captain Ri""
and sexy Son-Ye Jin as ""Yoon Se-ri."" And instead of the usual teenagers, these two are both 37, tho', IMO, look younger. However age does have its privilege's as they can surely act and have good chemistry together.Premise is that a wealthy and independent Queen of Fashion and skin-care products (Se-Ri from Seoul, South Korea) tests a paraglyder, gets caught in a Tornado - AND ends up in North Korea! - where she meets Captain Ri, and the games begin.17 x 2-hour episodes is long enough to flesh out the story. Highlights are the differences between life in North Korean villages versus the capitalist and hedonism of South Korea's Seoul. Which leads to some hilarious exchanges.Throw in back-stabbing siblings, power hungry military types, Chinese Mafia, naïve army conscripts, the usual Love Triangles with jealousy abound, nutty parents - and you get a pretty decent show. Have your tissues handy for the last few episodes. Check it out. All in all, IMO, worth 9/10.",9
"I might be a little late with this review, but I had to.I started watching the series in march 2020, but after the first three episodes it got boring. At that time it didn't get to me.
At the beginning of this year I overheard some friends talking about this show. It got me excited again, which let me to grab my laptop for the second time. Let me tell you, I was hooked to the series. I definitely stayed up late many times.There are many things to notice from the series. The chemistry, the development of the characters and the interactions between the characters. Name it, this show has it. Yes, this show is about romance, but let us not forget the well-played action scenes. And when you watch the last two episodes, you realise that you finally really know the characters and the motives of their actions.Crash Landing On You, you definitely left some scars. The numerous times I had to wipe away some tears, uncountable... It also made me realise that love does have boundaries. Even if you love someone deeply, you will always face obstacles along the way.",9
I enjoyed immensely this Korean Tv series. It was the most delightful surprise!!! A most beautiful love story with a glimpse into the Korean way of life!!! Great performances by the actors as well. I was moved more than once.,9
"I do not know how many times it has happened after watching this web series that I was just about to cry but it did not happen, but I loved it very much....
Love you Ms.Yoon SI RI & Mr.Ri",10
"Captain Ri and Yoon Se Ri are one of the best pairing in Kdrama land! A beautiful romance yet comedic scenes are well portrayed by Hyun Bin, Son Ye Jin, and all the cast as well. No wonder that they are dating dating nowadays hehe. Ok, back to topic, the plot, the cinematography, and the good soundtrack are unites as one as well this drama ends. I really appreciate the cast, the director, the writer, and the whole crew for making this beautiful drama! Good Job!",10
"I love every single moment of this drama.
The story and the cast are soooo amazing.
This drama has everything that a good and perfect drama should have.",10
"Selfless, deep and intense love. I watched many korean drama series but this one is so engaging. I wish everyone find this kind of intense love.",10
"OMG I don't want that this stops I want this will go forever, I love this show I feel for this show feeling bad after this finished",10
"I did not want to finish this series and did everything I could to prolong watching the finale. I was mesmerized by the woven subplots and the honesty portrayed by all of the actors...especially the 2 leads. While heavily emotional, there was enough comedy, suspense and action to drive each episode's content. Everything that I wanted to happen happened and the expectation of karma coming around; or character/relationship developments had me binge watching this series. As I was getting closer and closer to the end, I just wanted to go back to the beginning and start over again. I loved the vulnerability of Ri in Hyun Bin and Se-ri in Son Ye-jin, along with the N Korean military crew. Men should not be portrayed as emotionless statues. It's refreshing to see the emotion, respect and devotion from them.
Such a beautiful and respectful culture/country that I will visit one day. Yes this is fiction, but some of us still dream about finding that kind of devotion, respect and love. I was begging my friends to watch this series just so I had someone to share and discuss it with. Great job to everyone involved with this series. You have made me a dedicated K-drama fan!!",10
"Everything about this show... EVERYTHING is sublime. The storyline and all of its subplots, the acting, the direction, the pace, the comedic moments on the heels of heartbreak. Just... everything.
It's the small moments that get you. The women's reactions upon receiving their face cream. The bewilderment and grief of the ducklings when Se-ri is shot (No... NO!). The abject fear of the villagers and the utter self-loathing of The Rat. The steely sang froid of Ri Jeong-hyeok's abuji...
Unable to stop yourself, you become a voyeur of the most profound moments in these people's lives and are left richer for it.",10
"I don't write review usually. But this one compelled me to do so. This is one of the best series period.
Watch it to experience awesomeness..
For Indians, they have voice dubbing in Hindi. The dubbing is awesome..",10
"The series actually shows that there can be nice people and humane people who are true to their feelings and keep their promises. The sensibilities of this series matched so much. Love is not physical, though not denying the importance, but I like to believe that it is more than that to last.",9
"There is no words to say..loss for words.
love you hyunbin
love you sonyejin

"Review By Kamal KCrash Landing On You was about our main female character that ends up in North Korea after getting into an unexpected accident and a North Korean soldier that ends up falling inlove with her. Sounds interesting right? Well the premise of the story is already an attention grabbing . Every episode leaves you wanting for more. All characters are potrayed very well by the actors. You will enjoy every bits of it, This drama makes you care for every characters, no one is left behind. Our main leads have great chemistry like I can't imgine any actors playing the same role, Hyun Bin and Son Ye-jin were really meant to play the roles of Captain Ri Jeong-Heok and Yoon Se-ri. All in all Crash Landing on You managed to give everything I want from a rom-com series. It might be cliche and predictable at some parts but it was done right and this series will also give you a new perspective on how people actually live on the other side of the korean peninsula.",8
"This show absolutely changed my life. From the first episode I was laughing and enjoying myself! This is the first Korean Drama I've seen, I had seen a few Korean movies here and there, but no shows. This is a MUST WATCH for everyone no matter what language you speak. The story has romance, action, drama, comedy, suspense, LITERALLY everything. I never write reviews, but this show is an exception. I cannot stress this enough: WATCH IT.",10
"I gave 1 because the guy in North Korea died. now I feel so bad for watching. If he was alive I would give 10. In general, movie was awesome.",1
"Since the first episode, or even the first 30 minutes, I know this is going to be a big hit! I usually am not into K-drama with melodramatic storylines. But CLOY is something different. Still with that Korean romance that happens, adding politics and well-researched facts, the story happened to be very interesting with logical explaination. A bit too-cheesy set-ups, but we all need uplifting stories to hold onto nowadays don't we? The second part (after Se Ri left North Korea) was a bit cliche, but still hooked. I love how the crew carefullt research about the most mysterious country in the world, and worked on production. Beautiful visuals, logical storyline, very well acting from top Asian stars, this is definitely phenomenal!",10
"Korean television dramas are usually well produced, featuring attractive protagonists, decent acting, and occasionally interesting set-ups. But they rarely scale any great heights and they are often laden with irritating tropes and lazy writing and they rarely have much to say. Crash Landing on You is the exception. It is a show that can hold itself up against anything produced around the world.
Two key elements: First, the perfect pairing of Korean megastars Hyun Bin, playing a North Korean army captain undertaking a tour of duty in the DMZ that separates North and South Korea, and Son Hye-jin, playing a chaebol heiress who paraglides into the DMZ because of a freak tornado. Their charisma just explodes off the screen. Second, the nuanced portrait of North Korea, with many realistic aspects, even if some of the worst villainy of the Kim regime (the Kims themselves are never mentioned except in banners praising the leadership) and the extremes of poverty and suppression are toned down. The producers and writers went to a lot of trouble in this regard, including hiring as a co-writer a defector who had attended film school and served in the Kim family protective detail.
Supporting all of this is a very well written story that combines drama and comedy, the drama arising out of the efforts of the captain to help his unexpected visitor to return to the south as well as his dealings with a villainous commander in the State Security Department played with snarling aplomb by Oh Man-seok; the comedy from the North Korean villagers, especially the women, the terrifically funny foursome of North Korean soldiers commanded by Hyun Bin, and the various half-witted members of Son's South Korean family and other hangers-on. The script manages to avoid all the idiotic cliches that overpopulate Kdramas and manages to bring itself to a satisfying conclusion without the saccharine overdose that one might have feared. I can't think of a single time the story dragged.
The great supporting cast is mostly too numerous to name, but a tip of the hat to the second leads, the ravishing Seo Ji-hye who manages to keep the straightest of faces as Hyun Bin's erstwhile fiancée, and especially Kim Jung-hyun, playing a mischievous half-bad guy, half hero from South Korea who flees to the north to escape the consequences of his various fraudulent business schemes.
All in all, a triumphant piece of work, that manages to combine adventure, comedy and romance in a perfect family-friendly blend. The real crash landing is when you've finished watching it.",10
"No movie or tv show i've ever seen, has come close to compare to this. And i've kept track of every single one, which is about 540.I laughed, i cried, i got shivers down my spine. Their chemistry is immaculate and the story... wo! Also their acting! I feel everything they feel. I've never cried so much my entire life (ep 7-9). They have a way of always finding the exact right thing to say to completely break your heart.The character arcs. The script. The scenes. The music. No words can explain how much this has changed my standards for both movies, tv-shows and especially men...Well done.",10
"Just as several other reviewers has mentioned, you get totally hooked on the characters! I just finished watching the last episode and I already feel like I miss them all. I don't know how I move on with life after this masterpiece. I've laughed out loud and cried my eyes out. The quality of this is insane in so many aspects. You won't regret watching it!",10
"I watch a lot of k-dramas and I always skip the parts I'm not interested in, but in this one it didn't happened once! Everything about it was so interesting, specially the characters. From the army boys, to Dan and her family, to Seri's family, to the women from the village. Honestly, there isn't a single dull character in this serie. It's been two months since I finished it and to this day I still catch myself missing the characters. And don't get me started on the main couple, I mean, they were absolutely perfect. Amazing chemistry between two amazing actors, they couldn't have been better. I'm so happy I watched this and I'm so happy it got the recognition it deserved. Only bad thing about Korean dramas is that we never get second seasons, and I wish so bad we could have a second season of this one.",10
"This show is one of my fav shows ever! It's a sweet romantic show with some action and comedy. The friendship between the soldiers and the main lead girl is so funny and the chemistry between the two main leads is so good. I've watched this show two times and I never do that as I tend to get bored. When i first finished it, I was really sad and now i'm sad again because I finished it again. This show is a must to watch!!!",10
This series is pure genius. Gripping and satisfying from beginning to end. I want to watch it again.,10
"Whether you are fan of K-drama or not... seriously you'll gona... become die hard fan.,of K-drama after watching this show.... seriously it is tooo good.....start watching it from today with your family and friends..,.",10
"Watched first 8-10 eps with some effort. Simple & elaborated, some are predictable & fake compared to real world life.",6
"I thought it would be a good story with deep drama and comedy.I love korean dramas, and liked Netflix series too, so I expected the same values from both.Unfortunately this drama is flat, way too long and the dialogues and so much repeated sentences.Direction style like a Chinese comedy what doesn't mean good.Some parts are ok, but most of the time is not.Music is not matching with the story, sometimes too loud and even annoying.Character error in every person.The story does not add up.All people out of their characters.Why they more than 1 hour long?It could be a good 2-3 hour movie, but it is not:(Childish, characters,childish jokes.Too long, over explained.",4
"Normally this story firstly show you the cruel part of North Korea how they are surviving their lives and then after that you fall in love with this series, the love story, of both are heart warming ,in last episode you really going to cry. And yes I also cried a lot in last episode, but end with happily.Give a try to it. This series gives u big lovable emotions.",10
"It is the worst k-drama i have ever watched, I saw so many people raves about it and how popular it was, i have high hopes when first staring to watch it and immediately dissapointed.This drama is so cringy and the storyline and scene is just so boring, waste of my time watching it, i have seen better k drama and this one was no where near it.",1
"Best best best show! I have got so many of my Indian friends addicted to this show! It's flawless! What chemistry!! Imagine having Hyun bin character in real! His smile and his positivity will ball you over! His acting was always praised but this one did a huge number to us .We love him and his character is our most favorite ever. You have lived us through so many emotions, you have made us cry, we felt pain when u were hurt, we were happy n clapping when you hugged her and we were worried when you crawled out from tunnel. Thankyou director for giving us him.The casting is spot on! From the leads to support, no one could have played these characters better than this crew. First of it's kind that I have gone n googled n Instagram followed a supporting cast! Go n sweep away all the awards of this year. You have set a benchmark and it will take a while to some other Kdrama to match you. The writer knows his characters and these actors have really skinned their characters especially Dan's mom ( who was also in Oscar winning movie parasite), the way she speaks English n says ""oh my gosh"". It's quite tough to say who is my favorite supporting cast. Maybe it's all four soldiers and Dan's mom!Yejin, Se-ri, she has never played such a fun character before who is Rich but street smart. I am just smiling when I see them together.She never played a victim and that's what made this drama more interesting. The way she looks at him and gets all worked up wen he answers he is okay. She knows he is always pained. She wants to help him by stepping back , n we feel that emotion of hers! Best expressions she ever gave on the show was wen she takes him shopping and he steps out in a suit . Omg not only her jaws fall down, mine too along with 1million girls watching the show!!!They have paid so much attention to detail that even his video game name was ""tomato cultivator"" because se ri had gifted him a tomato plant. Such small small details not only makes us smile but wonder how romantic the writer is himself!Definitely kdramas have fate as their backbone story but it's so touching that you become their cheerleaders. I have watched all the episodes at least 4 times in loop! I am glad to learn Korean language and I m so eager to visit South Korea!From secret garden to something in the rain, you both have got the crown of king n queen of melodrama respectively but this show has made u both king and queen of our hearts forever. It's gem and we will treasure this forever. I will still smile and blush and cry and cheer for this every time I see it .Special mention of beautiful OST. Amazing songs and lyrics. Descendants of the sun and Globin had their ost on billboard charts and now Cloy is taking over!I would like to thank the crew of crash landing who have worked round clock to deliver this . I remember reading news of cast falling sick because of tight deadlines. Thank you u deserve all that applause.Main cast to supporting cast, everyone just stands out and has their own charm. It's one of those few shows, in which u will have favorite supporting actor and will always remember their character and their names. Amazing bonding with leads, their humour to their feelings, when they unite, I m sure even the toughest heart will cheer and have a tear! Screenplayng is their backbone . Now it's over, what I am going to do on my weekends??Plz come to India also. U have massive fan following here.",10
Great K drama. I watch this with my mom and my cousin'sThis is Amazing!!!!!!,10
"This is a must watch if you want to enjoy superb filmmaking, acting, and a fabulous original sound track. The screenwriting is so clever, and unearths a whole world few think of - the lives and people of North Korea. For an international audience, subtitles can be a turn-off, but get over this hurdle and you'll enjoy a beautifully told love story, that is embedded in a world filled with thrills and suspense. Honestly, it's the best show I've seen in years. I rarely rewatch shows/movies, but I've enjoyed this one as much the second time, and wouldn't be surprised if I come back to this one again and again.",10
"How good is this Kdrama?Well I have watched dozens of Kdramas and movies and this is the only show that I have bothered to write a review.I loved the chemistry between Hyun Bin and Son Ye-Jin, have always love their interactions since ""The Negotiation"" and this show just brought it to the next level. The wonderful cast of all the supporting roles have also contributed positively to the show. Kudos to the director and the screen writer.This show has touched the deepest side of my emotions, and I have never thought that I could actually feel the joy and pain with the characters when the story develops.The side effect of watching CLOY is, I couldn't pull myself to watch another Kdrama as I believe none will be as good.",10
"One of the best k-dramas I've watched so far!?? In the beginning when she crashed into his world they thought it was a coincidence but it actually was the fate!????At the beginning he didn't knew anything about her, what she liked, didn't like, who she was e.t.c. And she didn't know who he was, how he lived, what he liked and didn't like. The more time passed they got to know each other better and better until they started to fall in love w each other!??At first Jung Hyuk was cold as ice, he didn't smile, laugh or showed any type of emotion. He worked in the military which explains a lot but at the same time not. He just did as his parents wanted and he didn't break any rules or laws until Se-ri came into his life. He became sweet, warm-hearted, caring and he laughed, smiled and even fell in love! He learned things from her like he's never done before. He sheered her up when she was sad and got jealous over her showing her appreciation to other men.??
Se-ri in the beginning was strict, a popular business woman who was going to take over her family's company. She didn't do anything except working hard for her company without taking any breaks. She wanted her business to become one of the best in the world. She didn't either laugh very much, was also cold as ice and didn't let any people into her life until Jung Hyuk came into her life. She opens up to him, teaches him a lot of stuff, laughed, smiled and became really warm-hearted to, started to take breaks from work and eat with other people like she never done before!??And when it comes to sacrifice their lives for each other it's just so sweet and adorable!!???? He sacrificed his life for her once and protected her all the time, and she even protected him once! It's just so adorable how much they care and protect each other. And I'm ever more happy for them when they're dating irl!!????Again, one of the best k-dramas I've watched so far! Loved the chemistry between all of the actors, in this k-drama they have a bit older persons, it's usually actors between 20-35 but they're over that and it makes the drama even more amazing and better than the others!??????",10
"Honestly this drama was one of the best parts of 2020 for me and introduced me into the fascinating world of Korean dramas. This drama has captivated the world because of three main factors I believe:1) It beautifully showcases the deep divide between North and South Korea, while not demonizing the people of the North as one would expect. It many ways, its a love story between two peoples not just the characters of Yoon Seri and Captain Ri.2) The writing: romance, action, thriller, comedy, the script balances all these aspects so well. You are laughing one moment and in tears the next. Managing intricate storylines and dozens of characters over 16 hour + long episodes can be challenging, and to do in a way that keeps the audience engaged is noteworthy. If you watch enough kdramas, you realize most drop their quality half way through but CLOY draws you in from beginning to end.3) The Cast: a story like this heavily relies on the chemistry of the leads and the production really scored with Hyun Bin and Son YeJin. Both are veteran Korean actors and it shows. Even though they are characters in their mid 30s, there is a lack of intimacy in this drama that would be frustrating in Western shows but somehow it works here. Luckily these two actors display more chemistry is staring at each other 2 feet apart than most actors do in love scenes. They play off each other so well and really just justice to their characters. The supporting cast is just as strong. From the village aujummas to the soldier squad in NK, to Seri's family and employees in SK, you'll find many wonderful characters.",10
"Oh man where do I even begin? This show has the perfect balance of drama and comedy, I find myself glued to the seat wanting more and more after each episode, it is truly a beautiful illustration of love, friendship, and family.",10
"The storyline is amazing the plot is well writen there are funny/goofy/romantic/dramatic moments the tv series is a complete package, the cast is so lovable and the chemistry beetween Hyun Bin and Son Ye-Jin is superb, truly breathtaking and the most terrific drama i have EVER seen !!! DROP EVERYTHING YOUR DOING AND WATCH THIS TV SERIES NOW
!!!",10
Even I hate romantic web series.. but this series awesome.. please watch.. Bhai Korean dramas to dhamal macha rhe hai India...,10
It has been several weeks since I watched the last episode of Crash Landing on You and I am utterly shocked by how much I miss these characters.,10
"Romantic comedies are easy to like and consume. Usually, nothing particularly profound happens, but they stir your emotions and deliver some good laughs. The Hollywood versions come in many shapes and sizes, but still tend to be a bit formulaic.Crash Landing on You uses many of the same devices as a Hollywood rom com, but it's set in such an unlikely context: South Korean woman, North Korean man, with the story spanning the border between the two nations, adding political, cultural and economic intrigue. It's not that cross-border rom coms haven't been done before, with culture clashes being one the elements of the romantic interest; it's actually been done many times. What makes this story different is the nature of the relationship between North and South Korea, which puts funny, crazy, and downright dangerous constraints on a romance. The writers make this a central element of the plot, and do it beautifully. It leaves them with no shortage of villains, unlikely allies, and all kinds of plotlines to work with.The characters are endearing. The two leads are beautiful, apart or together. Performances are generally excellent. I'm watching with subtitles, and it's not my culture, so it's a bit hard to finely gauge the acting performances, but in general, I think the cast is quite good.It's one of the strangest television experiences I've ever enjoyed. Highly recommend it.",9
I loved it verymuch .It's the best K-Drama availabe on Netflix . Mind blowing . Most recommended.,10
The problem is that this was the first Korean drama that I ever seen and now whatever I watch it seems to me at least lower.,10
"I just finished watching this drama and it gives an amazing feeling and keeps your heart warm. This drama will make you laugh,cry,love and all such things will give you a memorable feeling. You won't feel like fast forwarding in any episode, each episode will leave you wanting more. Everytime I think about this drama there is a warm feeling in my heart. The dialogues are mesmerising the cast is superb and everything about it is so good which makes me wonder if any drama will be able to reach its level. I'm not telling anything about the plot or storyline though I would've liked some changes in the ending this drama is nothing less than a masterpiece. You will regret if you don't watch this, you can cherish every moment in this drama wholeheartedly.",10
"After three reviews here, I felt I am being unfair for not sharing my impression of «Crash Landing on You». I watched it last year when Netflix had it on its list. I was hooked completely by this series that I've been a follower of South Korean dramas ever since.I've seen «Crash Landing on You» three times... the last one with me doing some fast forwarding to the scenes where the two leading stars are in it. Hyun Bin & Son Ye-jin tandem is one of the most perfect couples I've ever watched on screen! Their chemistry in this drama was unforgettable ??. The scriptwriter may have these two in mind when the story popped out; or maybe the manuscript was actually written for them purposely. Mr. Hyun Bin, with his charismatic smile, handsome face, debonaire personality and his awesome performance as Capt. Ri captivated the hearts of many, including me. No age limit (I'm a grandma). Miss Son Ye-jin, with her beauty and outstanding acting... what can you ask for more? Oh, Yes...the supporting casts were awesome too! The cinematography was wonderful. The soundtrack was fantastic. Kuddos of course to the director and to the screenwriter.I am still a fan of South Korean dramas. Thanks to «Crash Landing on You» for opening my eyes to their film-tv-music world. The country seems to have a lot to offer. If it was not of the pandemic, I would have visited South Korea last year. It is still on my bucket list.",10
I really hope there is a second season. Acting is far better than anything on NZ tv. Kept me in suspense the entire time. Casting was superb. Highly recommend to anyone who likes good drama. But why did I cry so much?,10
"It would be crime if I don't give a review of this wonderful show! What an amazing story, direction and acting! Romance, Thriller, Adventure, Fighting everything is there! Just a perfect package!",10
Anothervbest series of k-drama. Crash landing on you is best combination of drama and entertainment this is best show for all keep it up dragon cinema...,10
"A 10 here wouldn't necessarily mean perfect. There are some obvious cliches, particularly the amount of coincidences that happen in this show but the show still delivers right through it. The relationships between the cast, I can't quite describe it. I can't even comment if that's what I would expect when comparing North vs South but the consistency through the show is spot on!We're not even done yet, and I'm not sure what to expect with the ending but we're almost there and still continue to appreciate each episode (especially as it gets longer through the season!) Actually the only thing I can't stand at this point is that we're almost out of episodes to watch.",10
I created an IMDB account just to rate this series and write a review. I cannot watch another show after watching this series. I cannot move on from this series. I literally cried at many scenes. I loved the show very very much. I love the couple of Yoon Seri and Captain Ri Jung Hyuk. Absolutely infinity ratings to this series.,10
"I just created an IMDB account just to review this series and rate it 10 out of 10. I cannot watch another shows after watching this series. I don't think I will be able to move on from this series. I am just in love with series and the characters very much. I usually don't cry on any emotional scenes. BUT THIS SERIES. OH MY GOD!!!. I literally cried at many scenes. BEST ACTING BY ""SON YE-JIN"". A perfect couple of SON YE-JIN and HYUN BIN. I just want to rate this infinity stars. LOVE!!!!!!!!!",10
"Very first K-drama I watched. And, got hooked to!Beautifully made!",10
Aftr i a long i cried soo much... Nd laugh too... ???? Thanks to all the makers nd actors 4 making such a beautiful Drama..,10
"This has been a breath of fresh air. What an incredible show. Actors, story, setting, humour etc and the side characters are brilliant along with the main 2.. Would recommend definitely.",10
"This was my first korean drama and i must say i don't know what to look for after this it took my heart away when it ended and i feel like i'll always remember this, this show is the perfect example of how love should be and the only thing bad about this show is when it ends it makes you feel like you lost a family or someone you loved and you'll miss them endlessly.",10
I've been watching a lot of k-dramas recently on Netflix. I'm British so it's subtitled and I know nothing about Korea but I love them and this one is one of the best! It's suspenseful and the acting is amazing. I cried through most of the last episode. There are some action/fight scene that were really good as well. Overall just a brilliant series.,10
"It is the second Korean film I watched and the first drama. I already like Prison playbook but this one - holy shit!I often wonder if these two main characters are actually married or a couple as the energy between them is so electrifying, unbelieveable.Not knowing what to expect and not usually into romantic shows or movies, this one is really amazing!Need to admit it is slow at times and one episode to be around 90 mins is VERY long and so takes quite a bit to finish one episode. That seems to be normal for K-dramas.Still I love it and hell the chemistry is just so wow and the acting also first class! Romantic without being Hallmark-cheesy!Gonna look for more like this on Netflix.",9
"I have watched Korean Movies during College days and I was fascinated by their impeccable style of story telling. Amid Pandemic, K-Dramas were getting popular in India. And The Crash Landing on you is right on top of all K Dramas. The Story line is incredibly strong to evoke vibrant emotions among viewers. The Lead pair had done commendable job to bring this story alive. The cinematography, particularly the North Korea set up was infatuating.I didn't realize that the series has 16 episodes and each episode consist of more than an hour. The Writer and Director must be praised and patted on shoulder to maintain the theme of the story and brought it to its logical conclusion.This is definitely must watch series.",9
This Drama is all about ture Love ??.... emotions and patriotism towards ... one's country....,10
"I don't write reviews but I absolutely had to for this wonderful series. I am a guy and I am more interested in normal drama/action/mobster movies and series. It's not that I dislike the romance genre (I enjoy it when done well) but I just never preferred media that is strictly romance. For the past few months I was familiar with the plot of CLOY because of all the time spent scrolling through Netflix, and I always thought it sounded like it could be interesting. I was mostly interested in how the portrayal of North Korea was going to play out, and this would be my first K-Drama. One day I decided to go ahead and just watch it, and little did I know I was starting something that would literally change me. I was not expecting this roller coaster of emotions.It's only been about 4 days since I finished CLOY but I still think about it every day. It's one of those shows that you don't just watch, you experience. I was absolutely hooked once the ball started to get rolling later in the first episode. At first it came across as a corny show; there were some hilariously bad special effects and some goofy characters / dialogue. I was thrown off by that because I was expecting a much more serious tone. But at the end of the first episode you are very intrigued, and by the end of the second episode you are addicted. The show is so very full of life, and what was ""corny"" at first turns quickly turns into charm. (The special effects do get better) This show has a charm that is unmatched by any show I've seen. It knows when and where to be serious, funny, calm, thrilling, suspenseful, romantic, intriguing, and sad at the right moments.By far, the two main characters (Captain Ri and Seri) steal the limelight. The supporting cast is amazing and could have been an entire show on their own, but the chemistry between Ri and Seri is unrivaled. Jim and Pam from The Office are nowhere near the power couple these two are. When I think of the show all I think of is their journey together and nothing else. That's how amazing their performances were. You could literally FEEL the emotions through the screen like they were right in front of you. You can feel these characters develop throughout the entirety of the show, and there is never a dull moment in the entire series. You feel the love they have for each other and you feel the pain that they have to go through. You want them to be happy together. I can't recall any relationship in a show that was as amazing as this one.NON-SPECIFIC SPOILER ALERT: I would say the ONLY flaw with this show is how the story ends in the final 20-30 minutes. It felt extremely rushed, and I was left with more questions than answers. It seemed like an odd way for things to wrap up and the characters seemed a little too okay with it. That being said, it doesn't take away from the quality of the show.As for how I feel this show changed me: it taught me, someone who enjoys being single, the importance of loving someone. It makes me want to be the best version of myself in all aspects. When I finished watching this show, I felt an emptiness inside of me I haven't felt in a long time. I became so attached to the world of CLOY and before I knew it it was over. It was like a girl I had fallen for had said goodbye and left me. There are actually threads online talking about ""Post CLOY depression"" for people feeling the same emptiness after watching the show. I am unsure of how long these feelings will last, but no show has ever made me feel this way. I would have never expected a simple 16 episode TV show would have such an effect on me.CLOY is a powerful show that I believe I will cherish forever. If you are thinking of watching this show prepare for an experience you will never find anywhere else.",10
Ek number fantastic mind blowing extra ordinary heart touching love storyLove from india.,10
"Maybe I shouldn't have tried to watch this so soon after finishing Mr. Sunshine, but this k-drama turned out to be a big miss for me.I'm generally not a big fan of romance, unless it's handled well and not too over the top. However, from the very first second, this series feels like a generic rom-com.This series could have been really suspenseful, heart-wrenching and spectacular, yet they went crazy with the jokes and downplayed the gravity of the actual situation (which was pretty dire if you think about it).In the first two episodes (the only ones I've watched), the main character makes some pretty dumb decisions, which is understandable given the circumstances. But instead of portraying her panic and fear, they made her seem really ""quirky"". Oh look haha, she takes the wrong turn, how funny and stupid of her!No, I had hoped for a thrilling, interesting and maybe even romantic story, but instead it turned out to be a rom-com...",5
"Seriously in 10 years this is my first romance comedy show I have ever watched till the end and wanted it not to end ...
The chemistry and comic timing is super .All the Hollywood peeps , watch this and get ready for a happy ride ??",9
"What can I say about Crash Landing on You? I was recommended by a Korean friend and (having never watched a Kdrama before) had no idea what to expect, but I was hooked from the first episode. I can't remember the last time, if ever, I was so invested in a show and its characters. Finishing was actually painful for me, because I felt heartbroken to leave them behind; I missed the people like I miss dear friends. The romance is of course the best part - more on that - but the secondary and tertiary characters, the script, the humor, the pathos, and the direction are all delightful and enthralling. I won't repeat what others have said; I just want to explain what makes this love story so special.First, the chemistry between Yon Se-jin and Hyun Bin is unlike anything I have ever seen on screen. They are both amazing actors independently; the range of emotions that each is able to express with total realism is extraordinary. There are very few actors who can portray humor and pathos equally well but these two do it with ease, going back and forth between lightheartedness and heartbreak seamlessly. But when they are together - I don't know how else to describe it except to say they shine like the sun.Second, I love the way the romance develops. The length of the show and each episode really gives space for a slow, slow burn that is delicious to experience. And more importantly, it's believable. Too often movies and tv shows throw together two beautiful leads who fall in love without any realistic reason. Either they quarrel for three-fourths of a movie and then have a total change of heart out of the blue, or they fall in love at first sight - both of which are easy cop-outs.With Yoon Se-ri and Ri Jeong Hyuek, however, you see their relationship evolve over time and their attraction makes sense. He falls for her playfulness, spirit, and open heart; she falls for his honor, courage, and kindness. He helps her become more compassionate and caring for others; she helps him express his feelings and find humor and joy in life. It's amazing to behold - to see how they make each other more complete and WHY they are so well-matched.Finally, I wish every Western director would take note: you can show two people are in love without graphic and explicit sex scenes (I'm looking at you, Bridgerton). These two barely touch, but you can see their passion and adoration just from the way they look at each other, and that's 10x more powerful than showing skin. It's worth recognizing the skill it takes to do that - if there was an award for facial acting they'd both win hands-down - to express love with just eyes and a quirk of the lips. Of course, there does reach a point when the lack of touching strains credulity, especially once the story relocates to Seoul, but I suppose that's as much to do with the conservative nature of Korean society and what's acceptable on television as anything.There are many other reasons to watch this show, but the romance is, of course, the heart and soul. I love this show. I want to watch it again and again, and I probably will. I am so sad that I will never get to experience it for the first time again, but I will always be grateful that I got to live in Yoon Se-ri and Ri Jeong Hyeuk's story for a time. Thank you, CLOY, for letting me experience this journey.",10
"It's the modern day version of Romeo and Juliet, only more interesting. Captain Ri Jung and Yoon Se-ri truly know love. It was refreshing to see two lovers in their mid thirties, scarred and jaded at one level and yet so beautifully innocent and hopeful.The story is dramatic, of course, but with a little suspension of disbelief, it's truly engaging and free of any major plot holes.I have laughed and cried with so many characters in the show, I was actually a little sad when it ended, I needed more of their love.Definitely a show worth watching.",10
"Something fresh and great to watch. Great story, Great Direction, Great Cinematography. Beautiful Music,",8
This is the best K-Drama of all time - nothing left to say here.,10
"More than fabulous.. A great love story! Once you started watching it, you won't be able to stay away from it.",10
"Amazing series, excellent story, great acting by lead pair and others. Must watch all the 16 episodes.",10
First time I have ever watched a Korean show and not disappointed.,8
Simply outstanding. Go and watch all the episodes. You wouldn't regret.Still can't get over this masterpiece.So real and emotional.,10
"One of the best shows I have ever watched! A famous CEO of a prosperous fashion company from South Korea gets caught up in a storm while paragliding, which lands her in North Korea. There she meets a patrolling officer who hides her from the government officials in search for her, and falls in love with her in the process. The plot, the love story, the music, the dialogue I mean it is all incredible. There's drama, there's action, and there's love.",10
"Crash landing on you was my first kdrama and it totally deserves the best. Unique and amazing script makes you laugh , cry and love all the characters. All supporting roles were so good. Also, the lead couple had so much chemistry. Beautiful ost too. I would like to see this drama again and again.I just was a little disappointed from the finale and that's why I don't give 10/10. Totally recommended to everyone. One of the best kdramas of all time.",9
This is one of the best romantic drama and I suggest you watch this one time it's full of love .,10
"I don't know if this is a good thing or a bad thing but this is one of the very few shows which actually gave me a Post-Series Depression..The chemistry, story, cliffhangers, slow mo, everything.... Is perfect.",9
Here's a show I would just pass on but it got great reviews so I took a shot. Only the Koreans could pull off such an implausible premise. But I Love it! Another spectacular love story. Really good job.,9
Just do yourself a favour and watch this amazing series.Hyun Bin and the Son Ye Jin!!!,10
"CLOY was my first K-Drama and I FELL IN LOVE! Such a well done production, terrific story line, and charming and beautiful actors. I found it very entertaining and a refreshing change from the same old drek of Hollywood and cable shows. Really enjoyed it, every minute of it. Got me started on my journey through KDramas and I've probably watched about 50 since watching CLOY in May 2020. I haven't watched a US show since that time.",10
I have loved every minute of this! It's a slow burner and I would recommend watching an episode or two before you make a decision on it. It's a really beautifully told love story. It's made me laugh and it's made me cry. I can't recommend it enough.,10
"Worth for watching..,... I am little disappointed in ending... But that is not bug deal.... Everything is very good.",9
"It's been more than 2 weeks since I last finished this show and I'm still thinking about it.The acting, directing, cinematography,music,OSTs,characters,emotions, chemistry between the leads all are top notch.I'm still in tears listening to the OSTs reliving the show through the memories. It started of as a light interesting plot show but it got too deep with emotions that I'm still mesmerized by it.I cried and cried for days ( first time in my life).I'm still not convinced by the ending (2 weeks really?).Still it made my heart warm and gave me comfort so it deserves all the praises.Probably the best Show(not just kdrama) I have ever watched.",10
"To begin with , this show centres around the values of humanity and unity of people torn by political boundaries through a unrealistic love story. The story seems to be well-written and implemented on the screen and it has many good thrilling , romantic and hilarious scenes which adds to the brilliance of the show. The actors were amazing in playing there respective roles and I would like to praise the special entry of Kim-So Hyun as a division 11 guy working as delivery boy. The actions were good considering it a 13+ age group show. Other than that, it brings out some interesting facts about North Korea which you will counter for instance, the train journey and find out more by yourself. Also, it shows how a cultural interaction would be between North Korea and South Korea and the gaps there.As for cons, I found it a bit boring after episode ten and episodes seemed quite stretched but all is well that ends well. More of such works are expected from the Korean industry and international companies like Amazon prime or Netflix should bring such amazing content to other countries. In the end, I would say that this show would remain in my memory for a long time.",9
Bro just go ahead and watch it.... it's the best after breaking bad..,10
"This series starts out a little cheesy and superficial setting the scene in the beginning, but once the 2 lead characters meet and the real story starts, it's hard to stop watching. The series is filled with compelling characters that provide a lot of complimentary storylines and comic relief. The chemistry of the 2 leads will suck you in and having you on a roller coaster of emotions following their beautiful story. It might be a little cheesy at times, but it's a quality production that lets you enjoy looking at life through a rosy Korean lens.",10
"YOU can definitely watch this drama , Story , acting all are superb. Comedy , emotions , action all together here , you can definitely enjoy this drama. Ending is superb I like this from beginning to ending.",10
It's a beautiful and an excellent series. Everything is amazing about it .,10
"I've seen so many k dramas,but never seen such a masterpiece,it's a complete package of emotions comedy romance and action,besides descendants of the sun,I like this very much,each and every cast member stood out and performed extraordinarily,it's one of the best drama I've seen recently.",10
The way this series has been written and shot just feels so real. The story and the acting by each one of them Touches your soul. You can actually relate to the character.

The innocence and purity of their relationship is reflected in each and very step of the series . It's a must watch . Cherish it as long as you can .

"Yoon Se-ri (Son Ye-jin) is a South Korean chaebol heiress to the Queen's Group. However, her existence threatens her elder half-brothers and she is intensely disliked by her stepmother so she steps away from the family business and successfully founds her own fashion and beauty company, Seri's Choice, which makes her independently wealthy.Se-ri's father, who was recently released from jail and can no longer run the Queen's Group, wants Se-ri to take over. He favors her over her brothers, whose leadership and skills are no match to her talent and business acumen.As the Queen's Group prepares to make the official announcement, Se-ri goes out paragliding to test her latest line of extreme sportswear and is caught in a sudden tornado, which blows her over the Korean Demilitarized Zone and into North Korea, where she has a fateful encounter with Captain Ri Jeong-hyeok (Hyun Bin).Desperate to go home, Se-ri escapes capture from Captain Ri and his four patrol officers and accidentally makes her way to his stationed village, where they meet again. He shields her from intelligence authorities led by Cho Cheol-gang (Oh Man-seok) who were alerted to the presence of an intruder.Meanwhile, Se-ri's elder brother Se-hyung (Park Hyung Soo) becomes chairman and his wife, Sang-ah (Yoon Ji-min), wants to take over Se-ri's company. When Se-hyung hears from his North Korean contacts that his sister is still alive, he and his wife take active measures to prevent her from returning.Captain Ri takes Se-ri into his own home and enlists the aid of his four officers to protect her from Cho Cheol-gang. He also makes plans to smuggle her back to South Korea. Their first attempt by boat fails miserably when they are spotted by the coast guard. On their second try, he helps Se-ri secure a slot on a North Korean team headed to Europe for a friendly games tournament. In between these efforts, she makes new friends in the village and begins to appreciate their old-fashioned, simpler ways of life.Their plans are discovered, and Captain Ri is shot by Cho Cheol-gang's men in a highway confrontation. Se-ri drives the badly injured Jeong-hyeok to the hospital, giving up her chance to flee. He recovers and is angry at her failed escape, but his anger turns to gratitude when he is told she donated blood that helped save his life. By this time, the two of them can no longer hide their growing feelings for each other.Jeong-hyeok's fiancé, Seo Dan (Seo Ji Hye), returns home from musical conservatory studies in Russia and discovers Jeong-hyeok is protecting Se-ri. She uncovers proof of Se-ri's wealthy family background and reports this to Captain Ri's father. To help his son and appease his future daughter-in-law's family, Director Ri organizes a fake border patrol search for an alleged deserter. This provides cover for Se-ri, who is safely escorted by Jeong-hyeok and his men to a path across the DMZ line.Sang-ah calls an emergency board meeting and asks the members to vote in favor of a merger between Seri's Choice and Queen's Group, but Se-ri arrives at the meeting just in time, halting the vote. She resumes control of the business and returns to her opulent but empty life, and finds herself missing Captain Ri and her time in North Korea.Up north, Ri Jeong-hyeok finds mounting evidence of Cho Cheol-gang's racketeering and direct involvement in his brother's murder. Cheol-gang is brought to trial and found guilty, but successfully escapes on the way to prison. Jeong-hyeok realizes Cho Cheol-gang has crossed the border and sensing Se-ri's life might be in danger, he follows in pursuit and also crosses the border via an underground tunnel.Jeong-hyeok reunites with Se-ri, who builds a cover story for him as her new bodyguard and introduces him to the comforts of her luxurious life in Seoul. She connects with city gang members to help locate Cho Cheol-gang.Director Ri sends his son's men to retrieve Jeong-hyeok. After hiding out in an overnight jjimjilbang and a few near-encounters, Captain Ri and his men finally reunite. A grateful Se-ri takes care of them, providing them with food and shelter and sends them on a shopping spree.Cheol-gang, alerted by Sang-ah of Se-ri's residence, tries to capture her, but Jeong-hyeok's team protects her. She is critically wounded in a confrontation between Cheol-gang and Jeong-hyeok, but survives. When Se-ri's father learns about Se-hyung's and Sang-ah's misdeeds through a recording which was provided by Man-bok, he takes away the chairmanship from his son and kicks them out of the family. Se-hyung blames his wife for their situation and she decides to inform the National Intelligence Service (NIS) of Se-ri's North Korean activities.Cheol-gang is killed by the NIS, but Captain Ri and his company are detained. Jeong-hyeok takes full responsibility and lies to the authorities that he manipulated Se-ri for his own gain. This would absolve Se-ri and his company of all potential crimes. However, the NIS finds no incriminating behavior and even offers amnesty to the North Koreans and help to get settled in Seoul, but they decline and decide to return home. Both governments agree to a quiet prisoner exchange and Se-ri is exonerated of any crimes. Her stepmother, having reconciled with Se-ri, drives Se-ri at high speed to the exchange, where Se-ri gets to see Jeong-hyeok one last time before saying goodbye for good.As Seung-jun is about to depart from North Korea, he learns that Dan is being held captive and he goes to save her. He succeeds but is shot. Dan professes her love during the ambulance ride but he dies in her arms. She grieves over his death and decides to avenge Seung-jun and catch the culprits. Ultimately, she finds evidence that Sang-ah and Se-hyung had used Cho Cheol-gang for their own purposes, which leads to their arrest by the joint task force of National Intelligence Service and the Seoul Police. Dan tells her parents that she will never marry and intends to continue her musical career.Three years later, Se-hyung remains in jail and files for divorce. Se-ri continues managing Seri's Choice and her other half-brother, Se-jun, is the Chairman of Queen's Group, with the day-to-day business being handled by a professional CEO.Before Jeong-hyeok left, he programmed a series of text messages for Se-ri with some help from the chief of National Intelligence Service. He teaches her how to lead a better lifestyle and to enjoy life with the people around her. Se-ri's tough boss image drops and she becomes a nicer and generous CEO to the people under her. One day, while landing from paragliding in Switzerland, she finds Jeong-hyeok in front of her. He has since been discharged from the military and has come to Switzerland to represent North Korea as a pianist. This would become a path where both can be together.Se-ri creates a musical scholarship foundation that supports talented underprivileged children from around the world, with headquarters in Switzerland. She appoints Jeong-hyeok as a director of her foundation; every year he spends two weeks in Switzerland on foundation business and as a judge in the final competition for scholarships. Se-ri is also a director of her foundation, and every year spends the same two weeks with Jeong-hyeok, with whom she finally finds love and happiness.",10
I love this web series so much. Everyone should watch it.,10
"I loved this series so much!!! It's spectacular! I used to judge Korean TV because I usually only watch American stuff and I thought it wouldn't be good or too cliche, but I'm fascinated now. I can say that it's one of my fav series now. Captain Ri and Yoon Se-ri have such a strong chemistry that I get goosebumps every time they stare at each other. Love them so much! Also, it's such a funny show, I laughed multiple times with Captain Ri crew hahahah they are hilarious! I would recommend everyone to watch it, but be aware, cause you are going to fall in love and get addicted!!! 10 stars.",10
"I can't stop rewatching this and thinking about the characters. I just started watching K dramas after a long time as a fan of Indian cinema. CLOY is amazing, far surpassing my expectations. The script, acting, cinematography, costumes and settings are all exquisitely detailed. Everything rings true, even things that are meant to be humorous. If you are sick of the pointless cruelty, inanity, fake sentimentalism, and violence that tend to be the stuff of Hollywood and you long to fall in love with characters who are complex and believable then do yourself a favor and invest your hours in this extraordinary drama. Yes there are parts that are contrived but all in the service of good storytelling. The acting, particularly between the leads, sizzles. Hyun Bin and Son Ye-Jin, who apparently are an item in real life, calibrate this love story with depth and finesse. I hope they won't be seduced by Hollywood-it doesn't deserve them! I am always on the lookout for high quality films and television from around the world. Few other works have involved me so deeply. And the soundtrack deserves special mention as well. Just a great experience!",10
"...this series have more than 8,5? The plot is so bland. It started very promising with this female lead character who was about to be the new president of the family company without the support of most of her relatives but her father. And then the tragedy happened... And started the boring plot of the girl landind in North Korea by accident. That also seems interesting to watch, I mean its North Korea. But no, its not what I wanted it to be. So unworthy to watch.",4
"The reason i saw this show was because someone told me,"" watch this show even if you are not into k dramas"". That person was right. Some people call this show too cheesy. On the other hand i heard most of the people cried while watching this show. Just the fact that they were able to make people cry without showing any intimate scene, is enough to judge a show. And in order to achieve this kind of emotional connect with the audience, you have to be a little cheesy but it is not fair to underrate it for being cheesy.I personally liked it alot.",10
"I'm at 12th episode , and I seriously don't want it to end.please suggest me more such series.",10
It is my first Kdrama n I randomly started watching it n now I m a fan of the drama n all the actors. Such an emotional series????,10
I have never watched Korean dramas in my life but this one has changed my perception about these. I literally fell in love with their culture. Both Seri and Ri have done superb acting and their chemistry was unmatched.,10
"I want more episodes, each and every character is touched my soul. In this show you can feel romance, thrill, action, sadness, comedy everything, I can't get over of this show. Its highly recommend ??",10
"I am speechles!!!! There are more than 17k people review it, nothing left to tell about this drama... Just watch it ASAP???????? it is 1000% worth to give time...",10
"This definitely takes the award for the best Netflix series I've ever watched.I was hooked from the first five minutes and couldn't stop watching it.I loved all of the characters. It's such a beautifully and cleverly produced love story.One minute you are laughing out loud, the next minute you have tears streaming down your cheeks. Get the tissues ready!I rarely write reviews but this one deserved it. Thank you, thank you, thank you to everyone who was involved in this production. Bravo!",10
Ehhh I've seen better. Don't waste your time watching it. Especially if someone suggests it...,1
"I just can't believe this series. It makes me want to cry, laugh, smile, get mad and then back to crying all over again. The scenes are very unpredictable. I love the roles of the supporting actors as well. This has by far the best korean drama i have ever seen. It has been 2 weeks already since my last episode but i just can't seem to move on yt. Forever inlove with the characters!!",10
"Well I watched many korean movies and i am not intrested in k drama. But I came across movie named be with you, moment to remember and some son je jin movies. Finally I got this CLOY. I had best feeling ever... All of them executed well there roles. Especially both hyun bin and son je jin. Must watch for who loves dramas.",10
"This is one of the finest show covering geopolitical tensions and complexities with soulful love story full of drama, action and very good storyline. I loved every episode and recommended to many of my contacts who loved it to core too. Highly recommend!",10
Loved it!! I would watch this on repeat. I wish there was another season.,10
"Beautiful. I sobbed through every teardrop shed on the drama. Acting superb. Captain Ri! He's gorgeous. I'm a retired high school math teacher in SC, USA. Actress playing Se-ri, her facial expressions and her heart bleeding for every one but herself. Ive only watched a couple of the K-Drama series. Crashed Into You has been the best.Why don't K-Dramas end with marriage, children, bright futures? I need a nap now. Great writing, acting, scenery, LOVED EVERY SECOND!",10
"When someone recommended this show to my sister and I, we were very hesitant to watch it, but desided to give it a try.After episode two, we were hooked. We got to episode 6, and had to stop watching it for a month due to having some trouble with Netflix (if you have seen the show and remember the cliffhanger ending for episode six you know that was not easy) so I bought it for my sister for christmas on disc (before I was half way through it).We desided to try and get my two teenage brothers and our adult sister to watch it with us, because we were sick of them making fun of us for loving it so much.We finally convinced them to watch it, and they were also hooked after episode two. My brothers said they weren't, but they were bitterly dissapointed whenever we didn't watch it. One night we were so busy it was 2 am by the time we were finished. We desided to watch it anyway, so I went and told my brothers (who were asleep) that we were going to watch it, and they jumped out of bed and we watched it on a computer because the TV would be too loud. Another night we also couldn't use the TV because it would wake our family, and the laptop was dead, so the four of us watched it on my sister's phone (my other brother thought we desided not to watch it so he went to bed, he was so angry when he found out we watched it without him.)
After I had finished the drama, I wanted to show it to my younger sisters and mom, she had been making fun of us for loving the show, so she made up excuses for a month why not to watch it. One night my sisters really wanted to watch it and my mom had no excuse so she said,
""Let's just get this silly show over with, then.""
After the first episode she said it ""wasn't really her type"" But soon she was hooked too. She even start copying the characters faces while we were watching it.If you go on her Netflix feed, all it is is korean dramas.We've since watched many other korean dramas, most of which I loved, but this show beats them all.I've seen the show four times and it's been a year since I started it, and I still love as much as I did the first time. I've recommended the show to 15 people, some who were extermly determined not to like it at all, and everyone of them loved it. The show only gets better and better as it goes on, the OST is AMAZING, the hilarious and loveable company five is the second best thing about this show, after the beautiful love story between Yoon Se-ri and Ri Jeong Hyeok. I 10/10 recommend this drama. Who knows? You might have just found your new favorite show.",10
No chemistry between the actors. The female lead doesn't show much expression on her face.,1
"If you're looking for a drama with a different storyline and a different atmosphere it would be a perfect choice. There is always a beautiful smile on my face each time I watch an episode. It's an entertaining combination of fluff, romance, drama, and political/police procedural. It shows the humanity in all echelons of society, from poor to rich, from communist to capitalists, from military to playboy. The chemistry is incredible, the emotions are real, and the casting is perfect. Watching the show brings you the joy of being alive.",10
"This show is a reminder of what true love is in the age of modern day relationships. At every goodbye, your heart aches, and at every union your heart rejoices. The beautiful sound-tracks, the mesmerizing locations and the intriguing plot have been the core of entire series. It also keeps the romance, adventure and humour alive throughout. I wish I had watched this series sooner, but I am glad I watched it anyway. Would definitely recommend it to all viewers across the globe.",10
"It is most beautiful journey. Everything in this is so beautiful, I want this masterpiece to forever be in my memories. One of the best ever for me.",10
"This is the best korean drama I have ever watched what a love, what a sacrifice, what a pure love in this web series we all love this I have no words.",10
"Push ""fast-forward"" button so many time. Some scene are just too cheesy and predictable. The conversation is just too slow.",1
"This is the second Korean series I've ever watched and not gonna lie, my expectations weren't high at all. But it surprised me with a different (even though it had some logical mistakes) and touching story. It was not only about love, but also about friendship, family and faith in good things. It took me so long to finish (I watched it literally nonstop) because episodes are very long. Hence it takes you to a really long journey during which you sometimes cry and sometimes laugh. Loved it.",9
I loved the male lead in secret garden so was looking forward to this one but it's a complete disappointment.First he could not express for most of the series except a few scenes. Is it because of too much Botox ?Second didn't like the character of jeong hyuk. Always acting hero to protect the lady are we? Not to mention those text messages with a world of free advice including how to be a good driver.Thirdly the South Korean part of the drama was so cringe. The security agencies acted like match makers.Finally they killed the other guy and ended the only promising love story in the series.Seriously I couldn't care less if they killed the main male lead.,1
I just love this drama. I never seen something like this. It's made me a beautiful person from inside and I love Yoon seri ( son ye jin) every single person should watch this before die. It's feel like love.,10
"''Crash landing on you '' was my first kdrama and then I got stuck with THEM !Super plot and storyline , sooo funny moments that you can burst into laughs but there are sad moments that can make you cry too
It is a kdrama with full emotionals moments .I loved every single character and the leading couple has soo chemistry and romantic moments!!!AHHH the ost is sooo catchy too!!This kdrams may help you to learn history as it talks for the war of south - north korea and it offers positive messages for the union of north -south Korea .The only thing that prevent me to rate this kdrama with 10/10 is some special effects that it is too much but after 4 episode it stopedI TOTALLY RECOMEND THIS KDRAMA TO ALL OF YOU !!!!",9
"Reallity is presented with comedy
...not only rom-com but more than that...i watch it thrice ...i can connect with every small charachters...side stories of people living in the north korean villlage is heart warming and pleasant at the same time...2nd leadcouple love story is also touching..
everything i found perfect..they also add political drama and actions to fetch more male audience from different ages...realism is enough for anyone to watch it once and never regret , never forget type feeling..i sometime felt it is as little bit longer but at the same time i want to see the comic scenes and romentic scenes more and more.Many dialouges are not just dualouges but having deep meaning in them.All actors from big to small fro. 5 min to 5 hour appearance...done a great job..they are fully into it.I think it will become in top20 webseries of the world.If it reaches to more and more people.For that it is must that this become famouse.If we do not consider GOT and vikings type historical fictious and avengers and harrypotter type of super duper fuctious stuff.Crash landing on you will remain in top 10 list in my fav. Webseries list.Which is not much fictious or magical but heart warming and surrounded by harsh reallity and full of very very cute and pleasant stories and movements.Hindi dubbing is also very good ...one can watch it in hindi it will be more interesting..because some comedy hindi proverbs are used in dubbing...I can not found any mistake in this drama
And enjoyed a lot with my family...
I am giving all 10 which i can do.",10
"You will gonna thank me for it...
Please watch otherwise your entertainment life will missed a gem.!",10
"To say I have become hooked on K-Dramas and films is a massive understatement and in the last few months I have lost count of the number of dramas I have watched. I keep thinking I've seen the best they have to offer, and then another series comes along and blows me away. However, with CLOY, we have been given something really really special, 16 episodes of sheer TV perfection, I haven't come across any tv show English language or foreign that has such brilliant casting, writing, acting, cinematography it literally doesn't put a foot wrong. The two leads were amazing, especially Son Ye-Jin who is one of my favourite actresses and their chemistry was palpable. The storyline is unique with wonderful romance elemements mixed with lashings of top notch action, comedy and thriller scenes. I can't not praise this series enough and I can say in all honestly I was more than a little devastated to say goodbye to these wonderful characters. Do yourself a favour, forget about the crap served up by American and British TV and really check out what K-Drama has to offer, you will not be disappointed.",10
"I think CLOY will convert a lot of people to being fans of asian dramas. The pacing of many asian dramas is often so slow (with all the flash backs and 60 second stares when they ""almost kiss"") and it can feel a bit wasteful of your time to take 20 hours, or even 50 to complete.But CLOY is engaging the whole time. It's worth the time. (Full disclosure, I'd probably happily watch 20 hours of Hyun Bin painting walls). Son Yejin is always amazing - and she is fantastic as usual here. Hyun Bin is great too, but his range isn't stretched much (watch him in Secret Garden) he is only being perfect.Some of the best parts of CLOY for me are the scenes with the North Korean characters. I absolutely love the soldiers as well as the ladies from Capt Ri's village. Kim Sun-young is hilarious. The writing is great.I think why I like Korean dramas so much is how they are full of just humans caring well for each other. And the banter. Koreans are masters of beautiful conversation. They leave you feeling full and happy.Watch it! You'll love it.",9
Do not trust a kdrama person who doesn't know this drama.,10
People who doesn't like this drama are from North Korea!,10
"Look what the tornado dragged in.Here's an effort to acknowledge the craft that went into CLOY while gliding around any spoilers.Some of the themes are:??The meaning of true family
{Who said this?: ""That's why I never go to Olive Garden- They treat you like family"" ""True family"" is not about DNA. It illustrates the highest ideals: Loving, providing, protecting, happy over the good stuff, & distressed over the bad stuff life brings our loved ones.}??Survival in an oppressive, despotic situation??Survival in a wealthy, greedy, love-starved, viper pit of a family??Misery, love, loneliness, & warmth are often w/o respect to wealth or social status??Overcoming fear in order to do right??Politics won't beget love??Korean women sure do love a tall man with broad shoulders. (& don't we all?)??Visual Metaphors:
In CLOY's very first shot, a hawk glides on a pendulum strung from heaven, far above politics. Yes, it's emblematic of freedom, but also lifting to the sky. Hawks always look down to swoop onto their prey. Is Se-ri a hawk?? Hmm. Ri's got the??, but is he de-facto prey?When Se-ri fails a ""mission"", Ri loses his temper. SO~ She exits. Decidedly. ??... Ri overhears how Se-ri bravely saved his life... She's been nonstop ??????... Rain falls as /that/ seeps (titit-tat-TAT) in...???CrrAAckk???? We can hear it on his face: OH. NO? I'm in Trouble!????/? Visual Contrasting + Crisp Editing:
The church/phony prayer scene contrasts with NK villagers who seem sincere about their beliefs re their country & the outside world. Compartmentalization? ?? Freedom-&-prosperity-engendered-greed that's twisted the SKs' faith. It's not about who's better. It's a c?ution; a reminder for those of us living in comfortable countries: it isn't politics or even poverty that erodes a person's ""humanity"". Usually it's 1 poor choice... followed by another...We go from a humble, but warm, NK clambake?? to a most appallingly self-aggrandizing & *shame??lessly lavish (yet profoundly unsatisfied) family plotted round the table in ice cold scorn. What is the first true family-time that Se-ri's ever had, we wonder?They just hadda put the villain in that creepy, overcompensating hat. Even bad-guy Cheon Su-bok is skillfully humanized. We can feel the pain in his gasping voice as he recounts that he was an orphan with nothing. It's juxtaposed with the two orphans that appear in the show. These adorable children are in danger of walking his path.??The opulence of Pyongyang is grotesque against the debasement of the little village's starving Children & comrades struggling beneath peasants' standards. Let's not guess about the ominous absence of any cats or dogs in the village.??Wordplay: One of the soldiers is playing video games at the internet café. We see him type: ""I request an alliance."" Cute.?? vs Swallow'Type' is used in more ways than one. They each know what ~rather~ ?WHO? their 'type' is.Did Se-ri crash, fall, drop, or descend? ...?She Swooped!Se-ri talks abt Ri feeling 'pressured.' Given their high-risk crisis of imminent death at the time, it's high comedy.Se-ri sleepily mumbles the ""liking"" gives her a headache. Does she mean liking going home, or is she liking her head on his much coveted shoulder???Repeated Words & Themes For Impact & Foreshadowing are like lyrics:
Was it... Is it Des?T?iny? It descends ? on the entire series with: Meant t? be... Must be fate... Again & again it's destiny.The word ""bodyguard"" dutifully works shifts. Ri bristles when he first hears it, but he had been doing the pedal work already, anyway.Over& over we hear: ""That's just like a ??"" or ""This isn't a ??! That won't work,"" or ""This is just like a ?? from the South."" A soldier obsessed with Kdramas explains/predicts it ALL, based on what he learned by spying on the outpost's ??. ""Dramas in the South always {__X__}."" Kim Ju-meok solves for X every time (esp w/: ""L??verboy!""). He was making connections betwixt Ri+Se-ri+dramas almost immediately, to Ri's unease. That gag never gets old. It strikes a chord with Kdrama fans.??Ri: 'I'm okay'.??Se-ri: 'You always say that' ??... If nothing else, Ri is consistently on tempo.??Reciprocity??:
They play CLOY on the black & white ??. The series' key shift in the 2nd half, treats us to a review, or a tour, of everything Ri did for Se-ri from a fresh angle. ?? shh! ??spoiler order in effect + We don't know who is???????They Understand Romance: These 2 are keyed into eachother. The way he looks at her truly is wistful. She knows when he's feigning sleep even when his comrades don't. Each tries to turn pages for the other; each looks to protect the other. Later, there's yelling over exposing h/hself to danger. Over the course of the show, they mirror, then fit eachother like base & treble. But early on, they can't hear the other's music. Watching their struggles to listen is hilarious. He's usually at a loss over her fine distinctions. Once each of them pronounces ""10 nice words,"" the contrasts become manifest. Afterall, beautiful harmony comes from complimentary keys, not uniform ones.?? Ri's recently honed grim discipline is palpable. He admits he's resigned to never expect happiness. The only tell that he's agitated is some moderate fist clenching. Early on, it doesn't look like he'll strike any wrong keys: He isn't one for breaking the rules or crossing the ??. He seems so stodgy that it almost shocks when, like an eagle, he soars in immediate & decisive action w/ precision timing. His silent frustration & confusion over the descending realization that, now, the rule-breaking may never end. His last of the '10 nice words' is the 1st step in his healing.??Hyun Bin's acting as CPT Ri, is prodigy level. When Se-ri declares Park Kwang-beom the most handsome one of them ""by any criteria,"" Ri has subtle, but clear disappointment on his face. When he sees the patch on his uniform, one corner of his mouth twitches up, & his eyes soften. His command of expression is virtuoso. There's not one stray muscle twitch: He holds a rigid stance for the length of the show. He's a Kpop idol fo-sho.Son Ye-jin is also exceptional as the loquacious Se-ri. She had ?? lines to learn for every 1 Hyun Bin did.??The show used consultants from North 'OZ' to ensure accuracy. It's a peak into the deficiencies & documented wretchedness but, moreso, the ??s. The system in NK is suffocating. Similar to Se-ri's family, everything is currying favor w/ superiors. As demonstrated, it extinguishes love & decency. After an arrest, village marms are terrified to be seen helping the wife, lest they get *arrested(?) too. Even families are encouraged to turn on each other or face prosecution. We see a father whose son is nearly dead, but his mind is on his position (Jun Gook-hwan is the perfect stern father & unflappable official). The ?? has nothing in it. It's just a hollowed out ??. The hospitals don't have blood for transfusions. Even Pyongyang suffers multi-hour rolling blackouts. Supplies are scarce but there's never a shortage of little bullycrats barking for IDs. ??There's a profusion of rules, regulations, & records to the point that /everyone/ is guilty: Queue up! They get you when they want to. Besides actual rule-breaking is the institutionalized corruption, such as when Ri is brought in for questioning & told he's #guilty!?> of whatever they ? declare. Human life isn't cheap there, it's disposable.??Clearly, Ri's father toughened him up. Ri's obviously loving mother composed the finer parts of his nature. Ri & his brother, Mu, exhibit exemplary qualities such as respect, integrity, loyalty & kindness. Ri's a natural leader. His unit reflects his example. (forget that mess on the day Se-ri arrived; that was destined).??Yet, as restrictive as Ri's upbringing plainly was, Se-ri's was even more ??dysfunctional. Both of them are from influential families - yet hers - w/ all that freedom, is worse than his. Despite the odds, the NK siblings in CLOY are more loving than the SK ones. Beware: if we allow it, freedom can corrupt us. But Se-ri, with her skills & being her expansive self, was able to brighten many lives in NK. She even turned a committed Commie into a metrosexual with a bottle of shampoo! Skills, indeed. It's darling to see this little group form a true family.Gotta love that budget. The special effects for the tornado are fabulous. We are treated to no less than 3 paraglides in the ??, all breathtaking. The second paraglide scene is esp gripping.When ?action is called for, they come correct. One scene is a shootout between a ?? & 2 armored ??. They practiced restraint, which boosted the realism. It took 7 or 8 shots to blow up the gas tank! No magic bullets here. The effect played out better than typical action features: That.scene.is.straight.bad@$$! ??segue into theme music??What a man, What a man, What a man???? Sing it, Salt n Peppa?????CLOY has something for all the senses: visual delights, a lovely soundtrack, the taste of fresh roasted corn, clams, & Soju (I could taste it), the hair that smells of flowers, & the feel of tears on our cheeks.Watch it and sigh, laugh, & (s)whoop.Watch it & weep, but no biting thru that??wrapper!And remember, nothing comforts after a good cry like a creamy cup of Swiss??Cocoa.??IMHO?

I enjoyed every second of every episode. It is a wonderful K-drama that depicts northern Korea in a lovely human way.I did't give it 10 points because of the poor kiss scenes (watch it and you will agree with me),9
It is the Best K drama I ever watched and it has everything there are many romantic series but this one is felt in way more different way.,10
"I'll start by saying that I'm not usually a fan of romances, but due to long covid I've been stuck at home more than I used to be and have exhausted most of my usual genres on Netflix. That together with Hyun Bin's beautiful face persuaded me to give this show a try, and I must say I wasn't disappointed. I quickly fell in love with the vibrant set of characters and their respective storylines. It's true that, at times, I had trouble believing that what was depicted was really an accurate depiction of life in North Korea, but if I'd wanted reality I'd have chosen to watch a documentary. The performances of the actors all around were outstanding and I was hooked from the very first episode. Definitely want this show if you're looking for something that'll make you laugh and cry in equal measure.",10
"I fell in love with this story. It is original and deeply moving. The actors are so incredibly talented! The cinematography is spectacular. It's filmed in Switzerland, but you will feel like you are in North Korea and South Korea. I felt the main characters love so deeply that my heart ached. Hyun Bin and Son Ye-Jin are phenomenal lead actors. The supporting cast was perfection. This story about an heiress from South Korea landing on an Army officer in North Korea was inspired by an actual event where an actress and three friends accidentally strayed into waters between North and South Korea by boat in the fog. This series is more fantasy than reality. It is an epic love story.",10
"I have watched almost 40 dramas till now and this remains my favorite for so many reasons. Top notch acting and chemistry between the leads. The plot is very unique and well written. The side characters make a lot of contribution towards the plot as well. Funny, sad and wholesome at the same time. My Favorite Kdrama couple of all time!",10
"I don't know how I ended up watching this show, but I am glad I did. It's funny and heartwarming. I am not familiar with Korean shows, but I just love the premise and the two leads. Recommended.",10
No words to describe how good this drama is. Just a spectacular piece of art.,10
Never ever have I bothered to write a review of a series or movie BUT several weeks after watching & re-watching this delightful series I felell compelled to do so. This drama/comedy/action show has unforgettable staying power! The leads have palpable chemistry & the supporting cast is truly endearing. The marvelous cinematography & musical score add to the pure enjoyment of my now favorite series!,10
The first K drama that I have ever watched ang I loved it.,10
"I love it , I'm not going to write down a research here , Just simple and humble , It really is good .",9
"When Worlds CollideAfter finally giving the Korean Drama genre a chance, I have to say that my expectations were absolutely blown out of the water. The brilliant writers of Crash Landing on You, were able to create a story that is able to sway your heart at a moment's notice. The drama begins with the lead protagonist Yoon Seri, the successful heiress of a large business company from South Korea, who gets into a paragliding accident and finds herself stranded in North Korea, only to be found by a North Korean military officer, Captain Ri Jeong Hyeok. With the work of the brilliant writers and amazing acting from the cast, we can see how the drama utilizes the concept of contrast to get a much more developed story about two very different people from two very different worlds. At first, their differences were what set them apart, but it turns out to be the very thing that brings them together.One of the many ways that Crash Landing on You utilizes the effect of contrast is its ability to change locations from one to another without it feeling forced or unnatural. The scenery of the film is able to feel like its own character. It takes us from the rural and undeveloped towns of North Korea, to the extreme opposite in the more urban hustle and bustle business life in South Korea. It even manages to take us to the beautiful green landscape of Switzerland that has this very mystical feel to it. As the show progresses, it's able to blend multiple plot lines while incorporating all of these different types of settings. A majority of the story's plot comes from the location itself. Where they are affects them heavily and that gives whatever setting the scene takes place in a unique personified effect. There is one scene in particular where Seri finally makes it back to her luxurious home in South Korea after being trapped in the North for close to a month. She finally is able to relax and unwind, and really reflect on all the differences she faced when living in the North. No more random house inspections from the village security guards, no more random power outages throughout the day, and no more having to take baths in a wooden barrel. It allows us to really feel the gravity of the situation a little bit better since North and South Korea are two extremely different countries.While the contrast in the setting and location plays a big part in the making of this story, the characters themselves may be the biggest contrast there is. The two main protagonists, Yoon Seri, and Ri Jeong Hyeok, are about as different as two people can be. First, we have Yoon Seri, the heiress to a wealthy family in the heart of Seoul, South Korea, who has everything money can buy, with the exception of unconditional love from her parents and siblings. Very similar to other headstrong female leads like Mulan, and Leia Organa, Seri is a very independent, and witty female lead who isn't your typical damsel in distress when it comes to traditional Korean dramas. Then we have Ri Jeong Hyeok, the hard working, calm, cool and collected military captain from North Korea, who grew up as a soft spoken and kind piano prodigy, only to have his world change after grieving the loss of his hero in his older brother. Clashing these two different personalities with each other is a work of magic as we get to see how opposites really do attract. After finding herself stranded in North Korea with no idea how to get out alive, Seri stumbles upon the DMZ, or the demilitarized zone,(area between North and South Korea that divides the two countries and is under heavy military watch) where she literally crash lands into Jeong Hyeok while on patrol. Being the quick witted, fast talking business woman she is, Seri is able to convince Jeong Hyeok that her being there is a mistake and that she needs his help if she's to escape. Jeong Hyeok, being the morally correct person that he is, decides to help her only to find out that the biggest challenge isn't going to be how to send her back to the South, but how to maintain his sanity when he's with her. The pairing of these two opposite personalities leads to some of the most colorful chemistry I've ever seen between two characters that definitely take the show's atmosphere to another level.Being a Korean drama, the show's tone and feel are naturally gonna play towards one genre, however, Crash Landing on You is able to play with different tones and styles that make it so much more diverse. Thanks to the different kinds of contrasts throughout this series, the writers are free to have Seri running and hiding for life from North Korean soldiers, and the next have her drinking and gossiping with the other housewives from a small village. Jeong Hyeok will be shopping for suits off in a South Korean mall in one scene, and then be taking part in an all out brawl of a street fight in another. The show is able to seamlessly weave its way in and out of different tones as the show goes on to feel like a mysterious and secretive spy thriller, to a light hearted fun filled romantic comedy. Crash Landing on You is able to take inspiration from other genres and sprinkle bits throughout the show while still being able to stay true to its Korean drama roots. It allows the show to always feel fresh and give it something unique to stand out of the crowd among other Korean dramas.Crash Landing on You is a wonderful story that takes the viewer on quite the expedition of feelings and emotions that can even appeal to someone who has never watched a Korean drama. With the use of very cleverly placed contrasts throughout the series, the writers take you on a well developed and unique story of worlds colliding. Every character and every emotion is so well understood simply because there's another element in the story that's there to show what it is and what it's not at the same time. How North Korea is such an underdeveloped and rural country yet simplistic and peaceful compared to the fast-paced urbanized and loud country that South Korea is. We can expect to find a good laugh but at the same time shed a tear at any point in the show. It shows us that no matter how different things may seem, it doesn't always mean it's a bad thing.",8

"This series was really great. Really good storyline. I couldn't stop watching. I like humor, action, drama, romance. Although it was fictional, this also had some truth I think. Very good actors and actresses. I laughed and cried so good job!And what a beautiful places in the serie.",9

"As an avid kdrama fan, i know what to expect: romance and sob-stories wrapped in a specific theme. This particular one is an epic kdrama spanning north-south korea and switzerland, interweaving scenes between military intrigue, family company politics, romance and daily life in rural villages.The comedy isn't too forced, dialogues are really good, acting is excellent, the conflict is real, action scenes are pretty good, fighting scenes doesn't use slow mo cameras, editing is super tight and no scene is unnecessarily long, story is solid and keeps you interested, not predictable like 99% of the kdramas out thereHyun bin acting as north korean is consisten, perfect, all the way to the accent.Son ye jin's acting as heiress/self-made billionaire is solid, funny and enjoyable to watch.A minus:
1. Some of the action scenes are below hollywood quality. Could've been better.2. The military intrigue is drowned by the conflict between main protagonist vs main antagonist.",10
"I laughed with this series
i cried with this series
i lived with this series
ty for make it <3i offer u watch this korean seriesFlower of evilGoblinMy Dangrus wifeHotel de Luna.",10
"I recommended this to my British friend who had script writing work experience. For the first 2 episodes, he said this isn't his style - cheesy romantic comedy. But I recommended him to be patient, if you like to write a story.Few weeks later, he texted me ""I am completely addicted to Crash Landing on You !! I blame on you!!!"" Haha succeed !I truly hope that all of you are wishing North and South Korea reunify one day.. and cry with us..",5
"Without being biased, concerning culture, religion or ethnicity I believe south Korean romance/adventure movies that have continued with season shows followed by there episodes. These past ten years or soouth korean screen writers, producers, casting, directors and all other pertinent staff that are involved in making korean historic romance/adventure movies are by far to ME continue to be most aspiring and most important a feeling of realism South Korean romance/adventure movies were made based on time period movie depicts. As a filipino American citizen movie enthusiast myself whom enjoys watching romance/adventure movies from all cultures - I must say these past 10 years watching romance/adventure South korean movies my favorites have been 'Mr. Sunshine' 'The King's Affection' 'Crash landing on you'To all south korean people involved making movies such as the ones I mentioned in my fisrt paragraph for many nations to watch - and Im sure I speak for many other movie enthusiasts that are not south korean citizens-keep up these kinds of romance/adventure movies:) Greatly appreciated?????",9
"I liked the comedy from the soldiers but that's it , I don't see any chemistry from the main characters. I really don't get the hype. Jus Overrated.Asdfgghjkkkhgsaaasd.",2
"I loved this drama. All four main characters are amazing - Ri, Se-ri, Seo Dan, Gu.The only thing that is unbearable is that Gu dies.I loved the vibes and dynamics between the characters; Dan's beautiful outfits; Se-ri's fashion sense and at the end of the last episode, her classic outfits that look perfect; Ri's devotion, kindness, principles. I loved Gu's gentlemanly mannerisms and charms. I was swooning over him.I hope to find a love as strong as amongst these characters one day that will last forever.",7
"I never finish any series I've watch before but this one I get addicted I start from the beginning at about 10pm Saturday night end up to stop to watch Sunday 2pm !Every night after work I watch 1 episode before goin to sleep then finally ends to the last episode . I will keep looking for more episodes of crash landing .To captain Ri and Se Ri I'm in love with you both !Se Ri sorry don't get jealous I got crush with good looking captain Ri! Good story of romance funny action with life lessons .I will be waiting patiently for Crash Landing on you Part 2 ! Thumbs up for the director
To Captain Ri and Se Ri I'm now your number 1 American fan !!",10
"This K drama is something you should not miss at all. Whether you are beginner in this genre of K Drama but trust me on this.The Drama picks at very good pace where the clear representation of the two Koreas has been displayed.A way too emotional journey for me. I literally CRIED in between episodes.I appreciate the cast, the writer and the director for giving such a wonderful experience in the Romance genre.",10
"This was the first kdrama I watched after being hounded by my sister to give it a try. It is as good as it is reputed to be, an emotional roller-coaster of comedy, romance and tear-jerking moments.I was impressed by how well a South Korean drama depicted North Koreans, showing them to be lovable, patriotic and heroic. Ri Jeong-hyeok (Hyun Bin) a captain in the North Korean military and member of an elite family would risk his life and career to keep Yoon Se-ri (Son Ye-jin), a South Korean businesswoman who accidentally fell on North Korean soil in a paragliding mishap, safe and back home. The camaraderie between Captain Ri and his comrades as well as that between Se-ri and her North Korean friends is stirring.Side note: since it was my first kdrama, I wasn't aware that men could be as clear-skinned as women and thought that some camera trick was done to make Hyun Bin's skin so smooth-looking.",9
There Is no contest with each others. That' s the best drama ever produced. The golden globe award should be given to the protagonists Kim HyunBin e Son Ye-Jin!,10
"I might be the only one who found this show overrated. It is excessively long with too many unnecessary scenes and too much padding. The portrayal of North Korean people helping someone like Se-ri and being a mix of corrupt, unsophisticated, or peasant types is laughable. This show is the Disney-fication of North Korea, which, in reality, is a cruel, merciless regime. The storyline is utterly ridiculous.",2
"I've just recently got into watching kdramas. Needless to say, I'm obsessed. This one is so good. Such a good story, very funny, and just the right amount of romcom without being cringey.",10
This drama went so deep into feelings that it made a heaven for the audience. If you are here to see if you need to watch it. Just rush and go to watch it. You will never regret seeing such a great amazing series. There is not a single thing that is not good about this drama. I always cry after I see the trailer again and again. It's 2 months since I have seen this. I am not able to get this off my mind.The Chemistry between them can't be expressed in words. I have never seen so much caring people for each other. Though there are some villans too in this series and they actually make the drama more exciting and romantic. I commit that you can never forget this series. I was in love with Son Ye Jin myself. So sweet and nice acting. Hyun Bin also played his role perfectly.The more I say is less. I will really miss them. Just go and watch it if you have not seen this.,10
"A clever concept that is well executed, It is glossy and professionally made in a way we've come to expect from South Korea's booming entertainment industry.The casting of the two leads is inspired. Hyun Bin is charismatically handsome playing the North Korean captain with almost superhero powers (although comes across as much less sensually attractive after his South Korean makeover). There are parallels with the sort of appeal that Cary Grant had at his peak. An excellent performance that is so subtle that he can make your tears well up with just the slightest change in facial expression. He is matched with the brilliant Son Ye-jin, whose character has more variation as the story progresses, giving her more to get her acting teeth into. The captain's loyal crew provide much of the comedy (which fits into the overall mood of the piece, and never descends into cartoonlike behavior) and are well performed supporting roles, as is the main villain of the piece.The series is not without its faults however, One or two of the older actors needed to have been held back. They give performances more suited for the stage than the intimacy of a television screen. These stood out against the subtle and believable acting of the leads. The director has to be faulted for allowing these to mar the otherwise excellent production.And there were a number of grammatical errors in the shooting and editing which were disorienting. It's OK to break these rules so long as you do so knowingly, aware of the effect of doing so. They mostly felt like sloppy mistakes. Again the director needs to own these, Two stars were lost for these flaws.And lets face the fact that it did not need to be as long as it is. The endless replaying of scenes, and repetitive flashbacks all felt like padding, as though the production company was being paid by the second of airtime.Despite these complaints, I was completely sucked in, wanting, wanting for the two leads to admit what we could all see, tears running down my face when they started to acknowledge each other's feelings. Often laughing out loud. Forcing myself not to binge, rationing to one episode at a time (except for the last two, which turned out to be the weakest).If you can cope with a long very soapy action love story, with compellingly beautiful leads, set in the two Koreas, go for it. You'll have a ball (and a bawl).",8
"1st part was enjoyable. It was nice though there's no way she'd land in North Korea like that. The 2nd part was cringe af. It got too repetitive. A million times of ""it was my fault"", ""no it was my fault not yours"", ""you're getting hurt because of me"", ""I will protect her with my life"". I got so bored of hearing the same sentences over and over again and the lead guy's countless 'poems'. I enjoyed the 4 friends tho the whole time. It also didn't really have a storyline. It's very basic, cringe and clingy.",6
"After completing this it was just okay, it started out really good and interesting but like most KD dragged on to much still this introduced maybe a new Korean actress that could be a star",7
"EDITED REVIEW-
I wrote my earlier review after watching the second episode, and am editing now after watching the last episode.
I am in tears and the joy I am feeling right now is heart warming. This drama was so beautiful and fabulous... I have no words.
The story line is so good, you will be in tears and you will think again about K dramas, its that beautiful. Every character development is smooth, and its not complete 360 change which usually is shown. Its just becoming better. The costumes, music, scenes, dialogues, actors, editing, production... everything is so perfect I-... Its just awesome.
This show didn't disappoint me even for single second. The last episode is so beautifully, you will be crying that it ended and be happy about the ending the characters got.
And Boy did the actors act?! Kim Soo Hyun is famous I get it, but Oh Jung Se?!! Major shout out to him and Yoo Sae Ji!! these two acted so good that I got moved for real. I have seen Oh Jung Se acting as support actor in so many dramas, but this? This is how a good actor makes a supporting character into a Lead character. Its brilliant. New respect for both Oh Jung Se and Yoo Sae Ji.
This show is a must for everyone who thinks they are 'Not Okay'. This show will show you that being 'Not Okay' is 'okay'. You can have flaws too, and you will see that everyone has them too. You will see that being not okay is what makes you human.OLD REVIEW-
I have watched many k dramas, and this is very different.
Maybe because it's a Netflix original, but it has the touch of more than just k-drama. Whole production idea is different, including the story book display. Great concept. It's not the flowery, lovey dovey k drama fairy tale. It's a dark fairy tale. So i would recommend it for anyone, who likes k drama's concept of childhood friends meeting again and dark deep dialogues. To say it's playlist is good, would be an understatement. Just two episodes and I am already in love with it.",10
"I Just Say That This Is BlockBuster Drama I Ever Watch
Seo Ye Ji Just killed it and kim soo hyun performed very well
this very very interesting do watch and
plzz RATE THIS 10 STARS
Plzz Watch U Will Never Disappointed
RATE THIS 10 STARS",10
Very interesting and charming Tim Burton-esque opening sequence. I looked it up to see who designed it and sadly there are no credits listed toward the artists. Not sure why this is but maybe someone can get on that.,9
"A very well made drama. Interesting storyline, cast, strong female lead, and great cinematography. It has deep meaning behind the plots. As long as you get over the 1 episode, which to me was kinda boring, you'll get hooked!",10
"Best k drama
Wouldn't change a thing about my review .",10
"This drama is perfecto, the main characters, the story, the ost and the chemestry is on point.",10
"I wanted to like this show because the premise is very unusual. A young man (Kim Soo-Hyun playing Moon Gang-Tae) is the sole caregiver to his mentally and emotionally impaired older brother (played by Jeong-se Oh as Moon Sang-Tae).
Gang-Tae also works as a caregiver in a succession of mental health care facilities. The brothers constantly move from place to place as a result of Sang-Tae 'acting out', often in the form of panicked episodes based on his fear of butterflies.A famous writer of dark, twisted fairy tales (Seo Ye-ji as Go Moon Young) is worshipped by Sang-Tae for her stories and illustrations. Inevitably, Gang-Tae crosses paths with Moon Young, not realizing he knew her when they were both very young where he was severely traumatized by her behavior. As adults, Moon Young now relentlessly pursues Gang-Tae and the storyline goes from there.I'm four episodes in and I can see why this K-drama was not very well-received when it initially ran in South Korea. The character of Moon Young is written as an extremely annoying, privileged, prima donna who has childhood secrets and traumas of her own. However, it's hard to care because she's been written as such an exasperating person with a spoiled, cruel attitude and actions to match. I'm finding her tediously painful to watch. Sadly, this leaves the role of Gang-Tae reduced to a series of blank stares, speechless moments and zero emotional range. The secondary roles of a male and female friend to the brothers are relegated to sounding boards and only used as filler to round out the story.I'll try to finish ""It's Okay to not be Okay"", but I can't commit to it. The pacing is off, and the writing (in my view) borders on being unsympathetic to the world of mental illness. That being said, I've yet to find one character or storyline interesting enough to warrant watching the show through to its conclusion.",5
I just finished four episodes of this show and all i can say is WOW! This one is a MUST watch even if your not into korean tv shows you still have to watch this one. It's truly moving. The acting is simply amazing and the issues are real and I feel so many people can relate to the issues because in life everyone goes through alot of downs and this show truly covers peoples dark areas inside themselves they want to hide. Its a stunning show please watch if you haven't yet!,10
"The writers did a marvelous job with the storyline, and to have S.Korea's top actors n actress portray these characters makes it even more beautiful.. I have to say I've watch Oh Jung-Se- ( who is the brother) act in a lot of other shows, but this series , Oh- I hope you win best supporting actor award, your acting role in this series, is so different from your other roles and you mastered it! Bow down to you Oh Jung-Se..
And of course the main lead actor- the BEAUTIFUL and TALANTED: Kim Soo-Hyun
I gotta say for someone who hasn't done a new series or movies in awhile came out strong with his acting, but of course that's why he's the top korean actors in S.Korea.. Watching him ""work"" this character in details, you can see he has his entire heart/mind in this for the next 16 episode, the connection between him and his brother (oh Jung-Se) melts my heart, the sadness in his eyes, the love, the laughter, we can see it through his acting.. so far just 4 episodes, and I see awards coming their way! Great work, just beautiful!",10
"Let me say that the writers did a marvelous Job! On top of that the best of the best S. Korean actors portraying these characters and doing it brilliantly is great!
Oh Jung Se, you are going to win best supporting actor again! I've seen other dramas he's in and this one is something different for him, ??.. and he's doing it very well!
And to the main lead: The BEAUTIFUL n TALANTED: Kim Soo-Hyun, watching each episode you can feel his sadness, his love, the caring, he has for his brother (Oh Jung-Se) the character his portraying he nailed it!
Ye-Ji Seo, great character for you! Love it!
Worth to watch, if you like mysteries, and dark drama..",10
"If you haven't watch this, you better start watching it. It's not just a typical RomCom and a little bit of Dark side Korean Drama, but it also talks about Mental Health Issues which is timely relevant and everyone should be educated with",10
"After watching many dramas, this is by far the best I have seen so far. This is why...
Every scene is beautiful in it's own way. I felt an emotional connection to all of the characters and have become invested in the story.
It brings the topic of mental health to the fore front so is very current.
The chemistry portrayed between the two lead actors is heart stopping......just kiss already!! ??",10
An absolute must watch kdrama of all time!!!! This has been upgrading Kdramas to another level of amazingness. You should experience it yourself and I'll bet that you will not regret or feel like youre wasting your time for this. This is a masterpiece.,10
"I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS DRAMA. THE ACTORS, THE CONTENT, THE DIRECTOR..... THE WHOLE TEAM HAVE DEFINITELY CONTRIBUTED OUTSTANDING EFFORT INTO CREATING THIS AMAZING SERIES. IT TEACHES US ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF FAMILY IN OUR LIVES AND THAT SYMPATHY IS ALWAYS AN IMMORTAL MEDICINE FOR A BROKEN HEART AND A VULNERABLE SOUL. A TOTAL MUST WATCH!!",10
"From watching this show, people get a chance to learn about their true-self !",10
"Even though this show just recently started streaming, it already got me hooked on its first four episodes. I can say that this is not your typical romantic comedy tv show because the story line doesn't just focus on that alone. It also promotes mental health awareness, which I think, is not always seen on tv shows. It shows that there are different kinds of mental illnesses and how each one should be given of importance and should not be neglected. Anyway, its a tv show that is worth watching and looking forward to the next episodes.",10
It's only been 4 episodes but it's the BEST K-Drama I've EVER watched. I'm confident they can keep up the energy! LOVE THE PAIRING!!!!,10
I fall in love with this drama ?? the best drama in 2020,10
This drama is very different from your typical kdrama. It addresses the sensitive topic of mental health and it has me completely hooked after watching only the first few episodes. The actors have great chemistry; their charisma is insane. I really enjoyed the animations that were incorporated into the film. I highly recommend everyone to try experiencing this great drama for themselves because it will surely not disappoint.,10
This drama raised sensitive issues in which you can identify yourself . I just love how it's not only a drama but a healing process.,10
"Best actor and actress , good chemistry both of them",10
"Just finished episode 4 and am blown away, everything about it is spot on. Can't take my eyes off Go Moon Young who is made even better by the male lead who never changes expression, he is totally wooden throughout which just makes her that much more spell binding. Looking forward to more episodes.",10
"THIS IS A HEALING SHOWThere are definitely some things I've learned from it.~ Accept your reality
~ Remember your pain and overcome it
~ Love yourself first before loving others",10
Creativity at its finest. Highly recommended. This drama will open your eyes to what's going on around the world right now.,10
"Love the drama. A must see. The cast, the acting, the cinematography, the animation literally everything is so good.",10
"Actually I am not a fan of either the main actor or actress. I am a typical person who chooses to watch a drama because of the cast, while watching this drama my desire is actually just to fill my free time, not to wait for the comeback of the actor or actress. It could be called just an accident, but dang! even from the first episode I was very much in love with this drama, the main actors were equally very strong, their wives were very good, the storyline was not common and boring, it tells about someone's mental state, they have a good moral message. To be honest, since I became acquainted with the world of Korean drama, this drama has been included in the best drama of all time, in my own opinion. Look at this drama, I guarantee you will not be disappointed",10
"This k-drama feels different and I love different! I'm astounded with the animation, cinematography, writing, and acting. I smell Baeksang Arts Awards.",10
"This drama is just perfect, u can't find one better!",10
"I will keep it simple and short.The story tells about the girl who needs help in her life so that she can push through her life.She was devasted inside because of her mother being dead and her father who disliked her very much,who even tried to strangle her two times.When she gets to see gang tae she really wanted him to be partner but the obstacles that comes at both their life must need to be faced. Gang tae has to take of his brother meanwhile mrs.ko has to lift her company up once again and wants gang tae by her side. She is evil outside but angel inside.",9
The English OSTs in the drama are so good. Makes the drama even more unique. The adaptation of the fairytales are done so nicely. And Seo YeJi did a marvelous job. She made ne almost tear up many times,9
"I don't know how i can explain it, but this is best Korean drama ever. You know that story line, story idea is so interesting and anti mainstream. In every episode we get sad, happy, scared, curious, cuteness and many more. The actor and actress also so good. Oh god wish Saturday came so fast. Okey bye, i hope this drama also the actor get achievements",10
It's not a typical love story. I can't wait for the next episodes!,10
It just got you hooked from the first episode. the aesthetic this drama have was just *chefs kiss. i really tortured myself by watching this while it's still ongoing. but i could already said that it's a must watch !!,10
"This is such a great show!! It got me obsessed within the first two episodes. The main characters are both so good at portraying their emotions! I LOVE that the character of the main actress is so different to other main characters to diverse K-Dramas. Ok so let me explain. In most Dramas its always this quirky, shy, innocent girl that has no idea about life or whatever and that always needs the help of a man to achieve something. In its okay to not be okay though, the female character is strong and independent. She has more like this personality where she knows from the beginning what she wants and tries to get it by whatever means. And can we just take a minute and appreciate how visually pleasing the main actors are like omg they are GOREGOUS !!!",10
It's one of the best K series of 2020; Wonderful production with a brilliant script and dialogues; Very different drama with a great concept. Acting is the best I have seen in K dramas and with a very strong female lead.,10
"Wonderful production with a brilliant script and dialogues; Very different drama with a great fairy tale concept and perfect performance by the leads - great cinematography. Acting is the best I have seen in K dramas recently with a very strong female lead and with many amazing tension and romantic sciences, most are done with face expression only.",10
The best kdrama I have ever watched .. I highly recommend this drama.. you won't be dissapointed ..,10
Loved everything about. Loved the acting. Loved the storytelling. Loved the chemistry between the whole cast. Am hooked!!!!!!!!,10
The plot and storyline is lovely. Seo Ye Ji is a superb choice for Go mo young character. Feel happy to watch whenever Seo Ye Ji and Kim so hyun are together in a scene. The acting skill of San Htal brother is mind blowing. Hope to get much more success and awards in the upcoming years.,8
"Not your typical kdrama, it's really different and the chemistry between the characters is amazing. I love everything about it and highly recommend it.",10
"Excellent performance by Kim Soo Hyun and Seo Ye Ji.
Perfectly matching couple.
? fm SL",10
"It's different from the kdramas you will see. It's artistic, it's magical. It's so beautifully portrayed. Every scene is so emotional. I think it's one of the best I've ever seen.",10
"This tv show does not generalize, sensationalize or glorify mental health issues. They show that every person despite their appearance may have something they're working through. The main characters have insane chemistry (brother to brother, friend to friend, lover to lover) which makes the story even more believable and the scenes more enjoyable. I have never seen a tv show like this before and I absolutely love it!",10
For almost 10 years of watching kdrama this one is my top on my bucket list.amazing,10
"I agree that once you passed the first episode, you will be hooked and you can't wait for the next episode. You will never get tired of watching it over and over again... while i am waiting for the next episode, i watch the old episode again, can you imagine that. I like the acting, very spontenoues , very natural, i like the chemistry of the 2 main characters. They are all good delivering their roles though. very real. Not lousy or overacting. They delivers. The story is not boring and one of a kind. The story and characters are all unique. This will be my one of the best ever kdrama. I will be very sad if this will be missed out by everyone.",10
"Ethereal and mischievous, the show is truly a work of beauty as it contrives to thrust its viewers into a world surrealism. It's Okay not to be Okay (IONTBO) manages to weave the fairy tale stories of Ko Moon Young (SYJ) into the central plot of the show. Each of the fairy tale story is reflected on each episode. Albeit whimsically portrayed through stop motion animation and silent film production, the fairy tale stories speak of volumes as it mirror the real lives of the characters of the show.I would also like to commend the chemistry of all the actors involved on the show ---especially the leads, Kim Soo Hyun and Seo Yi Ji. Their on-screen partnership blossoms as they perfectly embody their characters on the show.",10
"Absolutely LOVING this drama. Everything from the writing to directing and actors/acting, Just amazing. By the way just found out it ranked No. 6 in Neflix world TV drama Jul13. Hope more people can watch this drama. Best KDrama so far this year.",10
It is the best drama of 2020. We can see how versatility kim soo hyun is.,10
"1. Sizzling chemistry of Kim Soo Hyun and Seo Ye Ji!
2. Beautifully gothic fairy tale aesthetic.
3. The sweet brotherly relationship.
4. The quirky sense of humor.
5. Perfect casting!
6. Fabulous wardrobe!
7. Best CGI effects!
8. Addicting OSTs!
9. The cinematography shots!
10. Most importantly, this show showcase Mental Health Awareness which is very timely and relevant.You are missing out a masterpiece if you're not yet watching it!",10
"Not your ordinary romcom korean drama, it's really amazing how they tackle and discuss this kind of issue. Because nowadays its becoming more and more stigma being emotionally unstable. In this novela they delicately discuss every issue and concerns of persons with disability. The acting of actors both Soo Hyun Ssi and Yea Ji are highly appreciated as well as Se Oh Oppa. Every episode is to die for and every episode exceeds your expectations.",10
"Best chemistry I have ever seen in a Kdrama. They're so good that I don't think there is out there who can match their chemistry. For me, they should be proclaimed as the PRINCE AND PRINCESS of Kdrama. This drama and leads will go down as one of the best. Broke the ITAEWON CLASS & THE KING ETERNAL MONARCH record and now holds the highest rank in the global ranking as (6th) WORLDWIDE!!! They also dominate as Top 1 in 8 countries and making a wave in western countries!!! (c)MelaParkALL IN JUST 8 EPISODES!!!!",10
I love this mix emotion you feel.. Great job the the cast and crew.. Director and scriptwriter good job.. Excellent!!!!,10
"Good chemistry for Kim Soo Hyun and Seo Ye Ji, aside from they're both looking good.
Interesting plot. You get excited for every episode. You'll feel their emotions, sometimes you'll feel you can relate and you can laugh and cry while watching.",10
"I really love it. Actors are beautiful.
Attractive script. I hope everybody love it too.",10
"Deep, meaning full but also fun and romantic drama.",10
"Who ever give lower rating must be lee min ho fans , they cant accept that , kim soo hyun havingbetter acting skill in so many ways",10
One of the best if not the best kdramas I've watched. Beautifully-written. Heartwarming.,10
"Never felt this excitement before when watching Korean drama. This is perfection from the casts, storyline, script, acting and in overall. This is my favorite Kdrama so far! Superb makes my heart flutter.",10
"The animation, cast, and plot are A+ I hope they can continue with more seasons It's amazing how talented these casts are, especially what they are portraying I hope more kdrama will be like this for the reason that it is so addicting Seo ye ji and kim soo hyun's acting skills are superb! so as the other casts",10
"The storyline, acting, characters, soundtrack, visual aspects, costumes are just amazing.The lead actors are perfectly cast for their roles. The show deals with so many real world aspects and has some real heart wrenching scenes. It will leave you with a sense of nostalgia and a sense of belonging. There are very few shows that come along and make you feel this way. This show will make you laugh, cry, fall in love with the characters. One of the best k dramas to watch in these uncertain times which will tug your heart in all the right ways. A definite 10/10.",10
"It's really awesome. Different from the normal trend, Best Korean drama ever",10
"It has been a while since I have not watched a spectacular korean drama. I think the last drama that hook me is The World of The Married. But it is different genre. As k drama fans know, kdrama recently introduce many types psychology and mental illness drama but mostly the drama only focus about their love story and the script seems off sometimes until it becomes so typical like any other kdrama. But unlike this drama.. every phrases, scripts all hook me up. The animation, direction, well written, and well acted as well.",10
Well written drama.. creative direction and excellent acting!! plus visually stunning actors.. chemistry between the leads is intense.. favourite drama this year so far...,10
"Superb acting, great chemistry, best drama! Sobrang ganda jusko!",10
"This series is great
everything about it is brilliant",10
"I have watched ahead of many k dramas in my entire life, and a lot of unique plot of the story and i've encountered a lot of lessons too. However, this fresh k drama gives me chill and goosebumps because of it's flawless storyline and ofcourse it's cinematography whereas the whole cast is very great with their acting skills. This is the only korean drama that has a different plot story regarding about our reality, the whole production idea is very quite impressive and it's not only about the flow of the story but also the lessons you'll get to know here in the drama. This is the new whole package korean drama of 2020 that you'll never forget.I know that we haven't complete to watch 16 episodes yet, but we already knew from the start that this drama is something. My experience towards watching this drama is that unexplainable or i couldn't just explain it through words but i'll try to express its feeling towards watching this. First of all this drama has an interesting storyline and i can say that the main cast has the chemistry because of its uncommon similarities. My experience of this is that, i was hooked when i first heard that it is one of the ""Upcoming drama of 2020"" and then when i read the whole story it gives me goosebumps because of its interesting storyline and ofcouse we all agree that we also want to watch this drama because of ""Kim Soo Hyun"" But actually it doesn't matter because this drama got me hooked. It makes me feel overwhelming every episodes that i've had watch gives me a lot of lessons, i mean every episodes will give you a lot of lessons in life if you're actually sad, bored, broken hearted or any other feelings you have in life it doesn't matter when you start to watch this drama. It also makes me smile like an idiot ofcourse like what i've said it has the most interesting beautiful storyline among the best kdramas that you already watched. As soon as you've start to watch this drama you'll never get bored or tired of watching this endlessly. This is the first korean drama that made me express my feelings through writing a review and also it mades me express my feelings that i've been holding inside for my entire life at last i've no longer to hold any pains inside because i've learned something from this drama. I thank the whole production for releasing this drama, i bet that a lot of people will love this wholeheartedly as well as i do. I am a leukemia patient, trying to live peaceful life while recovering and i found this drama that gaves me a lot of courage and hope. For many people out there if you found yourself needing a help and then this drama will provide everything for you especially the awaiting lessons! And one thing for sure i'm a die hard fan of Kim Soo Hyun! A lot of love coming from philippines! I love the whole cast and production, keep up the goodwork!",10
"Truly a masterpiece, with wonderfull music, talented actors and a breathtaking storyline. The director of the psychiatric ward Ok said: It's just like when You fart. If You hold it in 99 times and finally let it out, it could kill people. (in ep9)",10
"The best kdrama , I wouldn't change my mind about it.
I like their acting ; they are varrrry talent .
I like kim soo hyun alot ; he is one of the best korean acters .",10
"I watched around 200+ korean dramas and i'm so amazed by this drama. Excellent cinematography, editing, animation, directing, writing and most of all acting! The performances of the actors are one of the bests i've seen in a kdrama. Kim Soo Hyun, deserves to be the highest paid actor in south korea with many acting awards for the past 10 years of his career! (baeksang best actor and 4 Daesang awards)",10
"It's Okay to Not Be OkayIf you haven't started watching this series which is trending top 10 on Netflix, then please start watching and trust me you will fall in love with this unusual love story.I am finished with 10th episode of this series and I liked Everything thing about this series, it's story line, characters and actors playing those character fit perfectly to the characters, Aesthetic, cinematography and character development of every character with every episode, supporting actors are like cherry on the cake.Writer (Jo young) and director (Park shin woo) who is also directed Encounter another one of my favourite series.I feel director Park shin woo really have nack of portraying unusual love stories.As I said Every things about this series is so good that it will keep you hooked and with an excitement what will happen next.As the title says that it's okay to be not okay, which is well justified with the story line. There is one important character Moon Sang tae (Oh jung se) and one of my favourite who is an autistic person.Moon Sang tae cannot well understand human emotions but have memorized these emotions looking at different human emotions which he always sticks to his wall and remembers it and also never fails to show what he feels inside. Moon Gang- tae who is younger brother of Moon Sang-tae (Kim soo Hyun) and Ko Mun -yeong ( Seo ye-ji) children's book author. They being normal' human being suppress their true emotions deep inside their heart and keep a different face to the show the World.
It's not only the love story between two doesn't make this series exciting to watch but a different human psychology depicted through Ko Mun -yeong ' s children's book and titled episodes with the same.This depiction psychology and different perception is something where we are able to connect ourselves in our life and can understand others too.I especially liked the ko mun Yeong character which is not normal korean heroine character like cute and innocent (that place is taken in this series by Moon Sang tae.)This character is being shown as a real witch with breathtakingly beauty and fashion and it's not just because she is a lead she has to be in good fashion, there is a reason why is this character being shown as over dressed or high on fashion which you will find out once you watch.Moon Gang tae is a character with lot of patience who works as care taker in mental Asylum and whose whole life is been spend taking care of his brother Moon Sang tae
Being the only one to take care of his autistic brother and sacrificed entire life for him is craving for little care and love for himself.There are supporting characters who fills gaps and also make you laugh hilariously , especially jo jae-soo (kang ki dong ) who has really good comic timing , I have seen him other series as well, and his work in comic timing is just awesome and yoo seung jae (Park jin -joo) as well is very funny and cute.This series is just not the roller coaster of different human emotions but also the added suspense from the beginning where you could not to stop in between instead you will keep waiting for the next episode to release",9

I can relate to this show. I so love this drama :-) congrats KSH,10
"An absolute gem. I've never seen Seo Ye-Ji before, and i'm still mesmerized by how deep and sexy her voice is.",10
"I can't begin to explain my obsession for this drama. From the cinematography, unique scene transitions, animation to the sound effects is all done so well. It's not just a romance, it's so much more. The title speaks for itself, it's a story about healing but we have to keep in mind no one is perfect or will ever be and it's okay. It's okay to not fit into the ""norm"" that society has etched into us. It's about understanding and accepting. It's everything! It's not heavy but it's not light on the emotions either. It's the perfect balance. You will find yourself laughing so much then the next you find yourself in tears. I am fully invested in the imperfectly-perfect characters.",10
"This is the best drama in 2020, and maybe one of the best of all time. PERFECT",10
"I don't wanna this drama to end, but I'm curious about the ending. This drama is really amazing. They're great actors, really!!",10
"You guys must watch this drama, this one really out of the box, how they talk about mental illness is no joke. How the team of this drama production do their best in this drama, the cast, the lines, cinematography and the whole ost of this drama is really great! Let's watch and support it more and more guys!.",10
"The story is like an onion- it has many layers. Each layer reveals a mystery. It also took on a heavy subject such as autism and managed to cover it in a realistic manner. As I watch the show I feel the struggle for the caregiver and at the same time begin to understand and appreciate the uniqueness of the person with autism. This is brought about with good storytelling and great actors.The story is also about people who have been hurt and they are not doing okay. Just like the title, ""It's okay to NOT be okay."" , it helps the audience appreciate each character with their flaws and their struggles to the point of being endearing.It takes a while for the story to build up and it gets more intriguing as each episodes progresses.Unlike the typical K-drama, the characters are not immediately likeable and thus if one is expecting that- they may be disappointed. However, this show is worth watching because as the onion is being peeled off- we learn to love ourselves and others a little bit more. Also, we get to see the world with different perspectives, 'broadening' our hearts",10
"It took me a few episodes to be gripped but now I am obsessed and have watched them all again. Stunning acting - all of them, especially Kim Soo Hyun and Oh Jung Se. Such difficult roles and they are completely convincing. The reconciliation scene between the brothers was so touching.",10
I love this drama! It's probably going to me my number 1 kdrama!,10
"This is the best drama I have seen this year, very touch, be sure tissue ready before you watch, it makes you laugh and cry",10
"Very so much the best of this ""its ok to not be okay"". If you don't watch, you will regret it, because there is a lesson from the contents of the story in it. I like it, sarangheo...",10
Truly a very valuable treat that is awaited every weekend by fans of Kim Soo Hyun and Seo Ye Ji around the world.,10
"Almost every interview the cast mentions or describes it as healing drama. As I reached the 9th episode, I can get why they claimed it.",10
"This is the show that everyone might relate to. Some topics are quite sensitive and hits a spot to anyone watching. This is a proof that anyone might be struggling too. So if you're someone struggling too this might be the kind of show to make you feel better and light hearted.
This is not like any other kdrama. The actors are very convincing and gave great justice to the roles they're portraying. I can't imagine any other actor/actress doing this. I like the on-screen and off-screen chemistry of the lead actors. I commend the writer and director for pulling off this great show.",10
The most PERFECT drama ever. You must seen from ep 1... the visual is no kidding and also ost totally suitable with every episode,10
"Watching this drama is like riding a rollercoaster. Love everything in this drama. Actors, storyline, script, cinematography, etc. Best of this year.",10
"All about this drama is absolutely incredible. The storyline, visuals, actors and even the soundtracks",10
"Easiest 10 rating of my life. It's really hard to do romance movies or series that actually bring anything new to the table and feel distinguished and intimate. This series deals with the real harsh nature of life that most media choose to mellow while carefully easing you in. I haven't watched a romance series in a while and this one is what I would describe as perfection. If you are someone who reflects one's self on the lead characters, whether you are a man or woman, you'll definitely enjoy this couple's relationship. I know I do.",10
"Have watched a lot of Korean Dramas since Prince Hours/Goong and I can say this is not only one of the best but THE BEST drama I've watched. Not your typical romance drama. This also about brotherhood, friendship and makes you face your own mental health. Repeated multiple times each episodes and never get tired of it. It makes you feel a Rollercoaster ride of emotions, it definitely gets to your heart. Storyline, cinematography, the actors, OST and Tim Burton like animation is PERFECTLY GOOD. This drama is one of the best things that happen this year.",10
"You must watch it! Dark fairy tale mixed with slice of life, romance, and comedy in this drama is epic. You'll find that this drama is not like others. The actors and actress really impressive. They're so good at playing their role. They are also good looking. Worth it!!! I really love this drama, ^^",10

""Best kdrama of 2020""",10
Best kdrama series of 2020 and lead actress seo ye ji outstanding and standout of the drama and all cast are doing wonderful job!!,10
"This is probably a fruitless effort to actually describe how great this drama is, since I absolutely cannot express it in words. However, I want to elucidate that the way mental illness along with the romance and thrill are connected and interwined together has won over my heart. Not to mention that Seo Ye-ji is such a beauty, it's literally a treat to watch her. I love her and I never thought I'd be such a die-hard fan of this woman.",10
"It's an Asian hit. However, I personally disliked the drama for its limitless pity. Psychos are one-sided victims. The main character works in a mental hospital. He looks like Cinderella. Already in the first episode, the man was showered with misfortunes - he was beaten, humiliated, fired, kicked out of school by his autistic brother, he was cut with a knife, someone vomited on him ... And this is only in the first episode. To finish off the viewer, we were shown a beautiful, scarred body clearly hinting at the sufferer's difficult past. The main character is a storyteller, she is also sick and suffering. Like all psychos in this drama, her parents are to blame for her problems. All in turn cry, scream, suffer and sting each other.",4
"Making a drama or a movie on Mental Illness concept is very complicated and should execute it with very accurate information simultaneously show it to the audiences in a very understandable way.
I think It's Okay To Be Not Okay Kdrama has done a great job by showcasing various mental illnesses and how to cope up with it in a very unique way.
On the whole -
Best Story
Best Cinematography
Best Direction
Best Couple - OMG KSH and SYJ....I Love U guys !! Why don't you guys get married ?!
And Brilliant Acting by all the CastESP. KIM SOO HYUN ! Your Acting Skills are god gifted",10
"Interesting story, cast and great cinematography, plots and the chemistry of the lead actor
A great night food for everyone
I have watched many K-drama before, but this is the best.I felt an emotional connection to all the characters and have become invested in the story. It bring for me the topic of mental health to the fore front so it very current",10
"Probably one of the best kdrama I've ever watch. The storyline totally unique and deep meaning, the screenwriter and main writer are my favorite from now on. Beautiful from every aspect-- every angle, I can't find any faulty even its already half episodes. Appreciate for all the team!",10
"I like the story, the characters of the tv drama was really awesome.. Moon Yeung, Gang Tae and Sang Tae, kudos to them",10
"Here's a warning for you! Don't start watching the show before August 9, because you'll be forlorn once Episode 10 finishes, which will make you wait week after week for two new episodes every Saturday and Sunday, and that my dearest, is a wait you don't want to undertake. It's a rollercoaster of a story with sparking chemistry between the lead characters, typical can't live with or without cat-mouse chase. I am tired of childhood friends meet again storylines in K-dramas, but here, they know it at the outset, who they are, no surprises there. It's the sheer fact that they know exactly who they are, that they want to avoid each other, yet can't stay apart. Immensely creative storyline, set against the backdrop of mental illness, a much neglected topic. Regular people walking and talking around a psychiatric hospital, goes to show, mental illness of various kinds, which may not always be visible on the surface. Splendid performance from all actors attached to the storylines of the main characters. It's quickly becoming my all-time favourite K-drama - why? Because it knocks at all the corners of your brain and heart with well thought-out dialogues and screenplay. Must watch!!",10
"This series is excellent, you should give it a shot. From the story, to actors and even the cinematography I'm not gonna lie, it's ?? percent perfect!",10
"I dont know how to express, but im in love with thiss drama, the cast, the story, the background, I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS KDRAMA. THANKYOU FOR CHOOSE SOOHYUN AND YEJI FOR THE LEAD. THEY HAVE BEST CHEMISTRY TOGETHER. Not just they, but act all the cast is really out of the box, i mean ITS AMAZING DUDE. OH MY GOD. i love ITS OKAY NOT TO BE OKAY, HUUU I WISH SOOHYUN AND YEJI HAVE DRAMA TOGETHER AFTER THIS. THANKYOU FOR MAKING THIS AMAZING KDRAMA.",10
Literally the BEST Kdrama of the year. I literally sit every weekend refreshing Netflix waiting for new episodes to be released. I do not have enough words to praise this show!!,10
"It's a heart-melting kdrama. After a few episodes, it made me wonder what a man could endure before he broke down. How much sadness does a man hide behind high walls?",10
"Even though I'm currently watching until Episode 11th, it's good enough to tell that this shows can make you experience all of the emotions that you can expect from a great show. The cast deliver each of their role on point. The 2 main leads, Moon Young and Gang-tae show us how 2 people who need love and can possibly find love, passionately and wholeheartedly. The brother, Sang-tae, is portrayed as accurately as one good actor can, who has autism and is not willing to lose his only family member but trying to learn to let someone in their closed circle. Must watch!!! You will cry.",10
"Amazing casts, brilliant story line, and incredible crew",10
"This is the kind of drama we all need!!! After watching so many amazing dramas, this is a drama that makes me feel like my soul is LITERALLY getting healed. Each scene was so impactful and the whole drama was packed with so many different emotions. The way they could keep it light but still suspenseful is just... i have no words. I just love it.
I especially loved the scene where it was showing the female lead letting go of a rock that was in her hand. It showed how having just one person on your side, who loves and protect you, can help you become a better person. It was a breathtaking moment for me, I HAD GOOSEBUMPS!!! It was amazing how it was just a 1 sec shot.
P.s.
I have a question,
this is a drama that is trending worldwide but isn't doing so well in Korea. Why? I'm really curious.",10
The female lead is probably one of the best characters that I've ever come across in kdramas... She's such a badass queen that you start loving her more as the series progresses. The acting is extremely amazing.The drama handles so many mental and emotional issues beautifully. The personal traumatic experiences of each of the characters helps shape their personality. The drama has some amazing cinematography with such aesthetic visuals that it's hard to take your eyes off of the screen. I'd watch this drama again and again just for the experience.,10
"The story line, the actors, the raw emotions, pure but selfish love of each character, OSTs, iconic lines, mysteries and of course the romance that the world needs to see and experience as we face the pandemic. These drama will surely captivate our innermost desires and ambitions along with emotional and mental health care... To make it short, Its the best and keeps getting better as we approach the end",10
Since the first episode came out I knew that I will love watching this kdrama.I can wait for the next episode...,10
It's loaded with chemistry between the two leads. The visuals are another reason which makes this drama a must watch. The music in this drama are so beautiful and heartfelt.,10
Love this drama a lot!! Every saturday and sunday can't wait to watch it!! Good job to the teams!!!,10
"English is not my first language but I'm trying to put into words the amazing kdrama this is, it made me feel a lot of emotions and empathize with the characters, it's the best kdrama i've watched this 2020, Netflix did great with this, i'm grateful i started watching IOTNBO, the ost, the actors, storyline, everything's perfect.",10
"I hope this will have Season 2, 3, 4 until 100! ?? I super loved this Kdrama! ? Complete package and amazing actors specially SEO YEJI and KSH. Best Couple! Chemistry is on fireeee!! ?? I love youuuuu ate Seo Yea-Ji. ??from ????",10
"This is the first time I ever felt compelled to write a review about a drama. I am not very good with words, but I am obsessed with this drama and so invested in both the main and side characters. Beautiful cinematography, script and the acting... WOW! The chemistry between Kim SooHyun vs Seo Yeji vs Oh JungSe is beyond anything I've seen on any Kdramas. KSH & SYJ are beautiful and are just mesmerising to watch. It is refreshing how each episode is a life lesson and has an underlying fairy tale theme which is inter-wovened into the plot and the character's development. Each ep gets better and better. Counting days when the weekend would come, so I can strap myself and engross in the show. This show will make you laugh and cry, laugh cry within minutes. Thank you production team for this drama and for casting such stellar casts. It is truly a healing drama for me.",10
"It is such a beautiful show that deals with real issues and portrays real people, the storyline is superb and the director did a phenomenal job. I would 100% recommend this drama to anyone wether you usually watch kdramas or not. The actors did a wonderful job.",10
"The drama shared with us that fairy tales are not just about the ""and they live happily ever after"" but it's about pains, emotions, struggles, resentments, and trust that has been vanished and we need to pick up the pieces to find ourselves. Psycho But It's Okay is not just an ordinary Korean drama that you wish to eat popcorn while watching but honestly this drama empowers mental health issues. Another thing is the characters are is trying to give us awareness about the people in our surroundings that are mentally challenged and how can we deal with them. The best Korea drama ever",10
It's okay to not be okay is the best drama I've ever seen??,10
"It is extremely rare for Kdramas to focus on mental health. In this drama, we see people with PTSD, Antisocial Disorder, Autism etc. AND WE LEARN ABOUT THEM IN A DIFFERENT WAY by looking at their experiences and how the actors portray their lines. It is amazing!!!! This drama is something we need to cherish in history! And I am not exaggerating at all. Also, Seo Yea Ji IS THE PERFECT ACTRESS to play Ko MunYeong! I cannot imagine anyone else playing her role. I am happy that she is getting the recognition SHE DESERVES as lead actress. Seo Yea Ji is so committed to her craft, as I read articles of her past projects about how she prepared for her roles. SHOUT OUT to all the amazing cast!!!! The casting crew did an amazing job putting these amazing actors together!!!",10
"It is categorized as a RomCom, but it is more than that. It is a balance of diff. types. One thing it is a 100 percent is it being a healing drama. It provokes you to face the ugly truth we live in, on how we relate to people we consider less or different from us but at the same time give us that sense of hope (if we allow ourselves to be open with it) that we can be better versions of ourselves.",10
"This show itself is an apology letter to people who are mentally different from the society we have created thinking they don't understand us but it is exactly the opposite.
This show gives its audience what we expect from a classic yet different drama. The transaction from one scene to another is so smooth that you don't realise the effect as anything dramatic. The emotions of loneliness Sadness Happiness Jealousy Love are so amazingly portrayed that you feel like this is no big deal but will let you understand human nature.
Also how many times have you felt the need to ignore and not be bothered about those mental patients that we have separated from our regular society.
Think.",10
This Kdrama ruined me so well that it made do an IMDB review (for the first time since i'm too lazy to do one lol) EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS KDRAMA IS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT,10
"The natural chemistry of Seo Ye Ji and Kim Soo Hyun got me so crazy like i mean i can't help but to ship them!!! The casts are all amazing, the story line talks about mental health and how someone should deal with it. The plot of the story got me asking every questions on who's the real culprit. I MEAN HOW CAN I NOT LOVE THIS DRAMA WHEN EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS IS JUST SO PERFECT?!",10
We've all been going through tough times and it's hard to explain what you really feel until i came across this korean drama. This series is like a person who i could talk to about my childhood traumas and my mental health. This is more than just a kdrama. This has helped me accept my flaws and the horrible experiences i had. This has helped me accept and respect whatever life has for me and deal with it. I'm still in the process of healing bit I can say I have some progress after watching some of the episodes of this show. This is a blessing for me.,10
I definitely recommend this drama for you to watch. No spoilers. ;),10
"I'd never thought I'd find the perfect Korean drama, but here I am.. giving 10/10 for this K drama because it really deserves the 10/10 rating. Watching the main leads' acting is a truly enjoyable experience for me. The chemistry between the main leads are out of this world. I can relate to the characters and the stories in this drama.. As someone who has mental health issue, I'm so glad I've found this healing drama.",10
I've never been much of a kdrama fan. I've watched a couple through the years usually casually and would even leave some unfinished if i found it boring already. This is the first kdrama that has ever gotten me so hooked its crazy. Tbh it transcends the usual type of kdramas and its def a must watch even for non kdrama fans. Cinematography is stellar. The chemistry of the leads is FIRE. The acting is excellent. When the characters are in pain u also feel like ur in pain as well. And most of all the story is beautiful and relevant. How they intertwine fairy tales with mental health and mental disorders is so touching to me and it even made me reflect on my own mental state. If this drama and its actors/actresses wont get awards I WILL RIOT!!!,10
"One of the most well written, unique, brilliant, healing , and deep series i've ever seen
every single scene, dialogue is full of hidden inner meanings, and it's really the Best at symbolism and metaphors.the Character development in IOTNBO the SMOOTHEST and the BEST I've seen in k drama.",10
"I love this drama because this give a lesson for everyone.. Kim soo hyun-shhi and seo yea ji-sshi's acting is not joke, oh jung se-sshi also good well.
The point this drama is the best as I see ever, sometime make me sad to happy, suddenly feeling like roller-coaster lol. Umm they look good together and the best chemistry, I love them as the best couple. They are deserve getting a winner this year and getting Oscar.Hyunji forever-Moonmoon forever",10
"First of all I love love the main actor Kim Soo Hyun because he is just beautiful!! But he's a great actor since I've seen him on ""The Moon Embracing the Sun"", ""My Love from Another Star."" And seeing him made a cameo on Hotel de Luna and Crash Landon on You, I just couldn't wait for this series!!!
And I must say this one definitely doesn't disappoint at all!!! His chemistry with Seo Ye Ji and Oh Jung Se just phenomenal!!
The story just keep on your seat and keep you wanting more. It fills with all the right elements. Enjoy!!!",10
"This drama is a must watch! I am not a kdrama lover so its surprising that I can really enjoy this drama. The storyline is a combination between romcom and disney x tim burton, so it is pretty refreshing to see how each episode has a moral story about mental health that is connected with a fairy tale. Not only that, I give my ultimate applause to the main trio! Their acting is superb. Oh Jung Se really nail his performance as a man with autism. Kim Soo Hyun gives a dashing performance as selfless man who really loves his autistic brother (his visual is beyond words). And Soe Yea Ji can portrays her character really well, I got annoyed and jealous with her at the same time. I get hooked by the end of third episode and literally cant stop watching till the latest episode, and get to wait every weekend to watch it in Netflix. I wish this drama gets the attention it deserves.",10
And I didn't even forward 10 sec of any episode and it is my first korean drama,10
"This drama has everything I could ask for consisting of romance, drama, and mystery. Two people meet by fate and find emotional comfort within each other, healing themselves of their scars. Seo Yea-Ji perfectly portrays KMY with the combination of her fierce look and deep voice, charming many viewers. Kim Soo-Hyun is also an amazing fit for this role. One quick glance at his eyes, and you'll be drawn into the painful world of MKT. Both had hardships and grudges they've been keeping in, it's just a matter of when they'll fully express it. Each episode has a message behind it and it never fails to keep me wanting more.",10
The cinematography is absolutely stunning - each shot is unique and breathtaking. The actors are incredible and you're in love with them episode 1. I have never seen another show let alone kdrama at this level of perfection. It better win an award for best show because I'm absolutely floored at the overall gift of this show. It touches and moves you with so many different emotions- I'm only halfway through the season and I'm just itching for more.,10
Loved it. Not those kinds of cringey dramas. A lot of life lessons are told in this drama.,10
"This show is amazing and has you hooked from the first minute. The cast is fantastic and has so much chemistry. It's exciting, heartbreaking, thoughtful, and not as cheesy as other Kdrama/Netflix series. Must watch!",10
"I just really don't have words to describe what i am feeling of this drama. This is a masterpiece, an emotional roller coaster in which you are feeling emotions that you don't know that existed.
I am speechless and so grateful for this drama ""it's okay to not be okay""",10
"I love how this drama is about mental health issues and not a typical romcom drama. After watching this drama I have the courage to face the things that frighten me most and to remember all hurtful memories instead of avoiding them. Thank you IOTNBO! And thank you Kim Soo Hyun, Seo Yea Ji, Oh Jung Se for being superb actors in this drama!This is my favorite quote from The boy who fed on nightmares:
""Remember it all and overcome it. If you don't overcome it, you'll always be a kid whose soul never grows.""",10
"I'm not an expert in K-dramas but I've watched a decent number of dramas. ""Psycho But It's Okay"" has to be my favorite. The chemistry between the leads and the brilliant ideas in every episode amazes me every time. and most importantly, they educate the viewers about mental illnesses and it's normal for people to be this way, hence the name of the drama. I totally recommend watching it if you haven't already done.",10
"This drama is very well made. Its plot, storyline, casts, everything make it perfect. No wonder it will be hit drama. The casts, especially KSH and SYJ, also OJS really did a great job, their chemistry is no joke. Thankyou for making this drama alive. It s sad that the drama will end soon. I will be waiting for their next project and hope KSH and SYJ will be paired again in the future.",10
"Masterpiece is the only word that comes to my mind after watching this series. Amazing screenplay, brilliant story, and perfect actors. Seo Ye-Ji is par excellence. The message conveyed by this show is going to resonate for a long long time!",10
"This is only the second k-drama that I am watching.before this drama,I only watched my love from the star which blew my mind and instantly made me fall in love with Kim Soo hyun and k-drama.Then I searched to only find that most of the Korean dramas are like this same genre.so I was searching for something new and when I start watching this drama, I find that it is something new addition to Korean dramas..not that typical rom-coms.its a unique and emotional journey of love and relationship.this realistic portrait of relationship made me fall in love with this drama",10
"Literally a masterpiece. There's so much more than the visuals of main character. But the way this drama explain how life works through the fairy tale is just.. so pure. You don't even have to think of anything while watching it, the drama will heal you.",10
The 13th episode will surely give u chills. At last we get to know about ko mun yeong's mother.,10
It's a human healing drama. I can even learn about mental illness. Moreover every episode covered in a fairy tail that makes me curious what's fairy tail will pop up each on the next episodes. Still can't believe it will be end up soon ?? but ???????????,10
Salute to all of you (casts and crews). This story is really a human healing drama.,10
The actor who plays the brother with autism is such a wonderful actor. I hope people realize how good he is.,8
"This drama is one of the best I have seen. The story is rich and layered. It is very unique. The acting by all three main actors are sublime. I recommend it as well to international viewers, I am a native English speaker and have really loved watching it. It portrays various mental health issues in a sensitive manner and you will become invested in these beautifully written and acted characters from episode 1.",10
"Kdramas are not what i usually watch but this one is very worth the watch. The chemistry between Kim so hyun and Seo ji is outta this world. I higly recommend. Even if this genre wouldnt be your ideal thing to watch, I guarantee that you will like !",10
Okay at the beginning.Story Started to fall apart since the 4 episode.,1
"This drama is a total perfection. From the cast, soundtract, screenplay .... everything.",10
"This drama has a brilliant plot, stunning visuals , excellent actors and mind blowing editing. Absolute perfection",10
"It's ok not to be ok is a drama which centres around a psychiatric hospital where the sensitive Moon Kang Tae (Ye-ji Soo) works. Moon Kang has an autistic brother Moon Tang Sae(Jeong-se Oh) who is the only witness to their mothers murder. Go moon Young (Ye-ji Soo) a fairytale book author who writes stories on the dark side (think Tim Burton style) She also has a troubled past with the possibility her father who is at the hospital may have murdered her mother. The paths of the main cast have crossed in childhood, and their relationship with each other is troubled. Go moon is a flamboyant extrovert and once she sees something she likes she focuses on it alone and has no internal awareness. Moon Kang is shy and introverted and the early romantic exchanges between these two are extremely funny and enchanting. The music is excellent, the cast is superb, the story is well written as it slowly evolves and it is directed at a great pace. An outstanding drama with a gothic feel.",10
"Excelent story.. Excelent actors. Excelent photography and quality
Every character has a special and deep story to tell us...and all of them are great
This is one of the best Kdramas y've ever seen",10
I've been watching everyweek and so far it never waste my time and it will make you sit at the edge of your seat every episode.. One of the best kdrama I watch. Combination of drama and romance. Thumbs up to the actors of the show. Also the director and the writer!! Superb!!,10
"This show explores and fleshes out themes in ways different from what I've seen in usual kdramas. It has many original concepts but still has that korean trademark chemistry between the leads that will give you the heart fuzzies.In short, come for the romance but stay for the story. Also, Kim Soo Hyun is definitely not human... how can he still look so good after all this time?!!Side note: this is my first time seeing Seo Ye Ji and I am blown away. She is so appealing and extremely good at portraying her character. Currently checking her other works just to see more of her and her acting prowess!!! It's easy to overdo Ko Mun Yeong to the point of campiness but Seo Ye Ji plays her with such nuance that KMY feels like a real person.Why I love this show:
1. The character development of the leads and main supporting cast across the episodes is nothing short of amazing - each main and supporting character has depths that shine in different moments throughout the series.2. The sets are beautifully made and the crew's attention to detail is astounding. The animation and other means to portray mental health and how different disorders are experienced gave me new insight into what these people must be feeling when they go through their episodes.3. The laughs and humor in this dramedy are well placed, feel natural, and let's you laugh along. The serious moments are heavy enough to make you cry. The heartwarming moments are genuine and can make you both laugh and cry.4. THE CHEMISTRY AMONG THE LEADS IS NEXT LEVEL!!! The filial chemistry among OJS, SYJ, and KSH is so good you'll be rooting for each of them until the end. The romantic chemistry between KSH and SYJ is explosive!!! Can they please just be happy together?5. The music is interesting and elevates the mood of the show.Why this show isn't a 10:
1. Everything about and regarding the ""main villain"" in this series is the one thing that feels forced... there are a lot of plot holes and convenient set ups needed to make this villain work in the world of the story.",9
"The writer is a genius, lots of meaningful quotes, the acting of the players, especially Seo Yea Ji is amazing .. especially for episode 14 I think she worked really hard and deserves an award. Don't forget Kim Soo Hyun and Oh Jung Se, this trio is the best .. as a healing drama, this drama has made me learn and have a new perspective on life ..",10
"This isn't your typical romcom Korean drama. Watch with an open mind cause this show touches the issue of mental illness. The characters may seem confusing and even toxic at first but if you continue to watch, you'll understand why they are the way they are. Each character develops in their own unique ways throughout this show so pay attention to that. What I personally love most about this show is the powerful chemistry of the cast. It feels natural. I'm hoping there's a second season. Absolutely love this show, it may very well be my favorite Korean Drama and I've watched countless of them. Thank you for this beautifully written and portrayed masterpiece!",10
"It's a perfect story. Every detail is appreciate from the writer, director, profs, actors, music,and a lot more. I gained knowledge and it give inspiration this hard times. Is a stunning artwork! You must watched! Everything for me is perfect I always rewatching and never get bored. I always have fun because of this kdrama especially to character ko Mun-yeong, actor seo ye ji is super talented actor. Hope they have more awards and gain viewers because this drama is worth watching for??????????",10
"This is the best drama i have ever watch! This drama was different with another drama! This drama give us many moral value , very healing and very recommended! i still can't believe that the drama will end in this week .. i hope there's a second season on this drama with the same casts :))))",10
"From the script writing to the actors, this kdrama is just a masterpiece. It touches on mental health in a way that kdrama don't. The reality of mental health is depicted and often is really represented not just giving us a happy ending to some of the patients stories. From happiness to sorrow to anger, this kdrama is an emotional rollercoaster but it is amazing",10
"The story of a children's storybook writer with ASPD, an older brother with autism and his selfless caretaker younger brother. Yet the one who seems the most normal is the most broken and needs the most healing. A rollercoaster journey of emotions that provides a different insight to life for all three of them. This drama undertakes a journey of how each of them learns to find happiness, each in their own ways but each with the help of each other.",10
"It's okey to not be okey best drama of the year, so beautiful storyline, excellent actors, very good job the directors and the writers and may more... congratulations.....",10
"This drama can make you laugh, crying, and falling in love at the same time. Very recommended",10
"It's okay to not be okay/psycho but it's okay is not your typical K-drama.Love everything about it. The casts, the chemistry, plot, cinematography, the OSTs. It promotes mental illness awareness as well. The character development is on point tho~ and it has deep meaning behind the storylines.I've watched so many K-dramas (being a kdrama fan since decades ago) but for me, this is by far the best K-drama. Ever.
This is truly one of a kind drama that doesn't deserve even 1-sec skip.Hands down to the IOTBNO/PBIO crews!PS: i love KimSooHyun & SeoYeaJi...
their chemistry is insane and it's on another level.
I ship them and hope they will become real couple ^_^",10
"This is for me the best KDRAMA i have ever watched. Its a LOVE story in every sense of the word. It did not only show romantic love but also familial love, love for others especially for those people who need it the most. Every episode tackle an issue and gives light to it that melts or breaks your heart. Worth every time you spend watching them. Kim Soo-Hyun and Seo Ye-Ji's visuals are just a bonus. Kudos to all staff and crew for making such an incredible piece of art!",10
"This is the best drama i've seen in the past 4 years. the story is unique and informative in away. it tacles a very sensitive topic but they executed it beautifully. this drama is by far the well written, well directed and well portrayed by the actors. no bad acting at all!!! everyone deserves an awards for the great portryals not to mention the chemistry between the leads, it is on fire. it would be hard to outopced this kind of drama and chemistry.",10
"Since the beginning of this drama, I have learned so much about mental health and life in general. I was very short-tempered before this drama and now I learned to count to 3 before exploding ??. This dramas was filled with SO MANY quotes that pertained to my life and I can say that it made me a better person. I never would have believed a kdrama could give me a different outlook on life until this one. If you are contemplating if you should watch it, I DEFINITELY suggest you do and take in what they are trying to say about life. Also, WHAT AN AMAZING CASTING THE DIRECTOR DID BECAUSE IT WAS PHENOMENAL ACTING FROM EVERYONE.",10
"Best Kdrama period! The pair, Casts, storyline, and cinematography. Thank u so much PDnim, Writernim, and all the crews and staff. Hwaiting!! Seo Ye Ji sarangahe",10
This drama give me so many lessons and messages about life. This drama helping me healing. And i'm sure the same goes for other people who watch too. A healing drama. Indeed.,10
"The storyline is unique and powerful, it serves you dark fairy tale with valuable life lessons.The acting is very impressive, even could make us feel connected with their feelings. I love how this drama bring up mental health issues to make us more open-minded about mental illness. I recommend you to watch this slowly, and feel the healing process of each characters.",10
"Almost every line is meaningful in this drama. It was like a rollercoaster of Emotions, Heartfelt, Fun, Romance and about Mental Health... Also it has all the Genres:-Comedy, Romance, Bromance, Dramedy, Suspense, Thriller (Kind of), Horror(it feels at some points). I guess not even an single character was ignored, story of Lead cast as well as Supporting cast was well covered and ended, all of them have done a great job. So just go and watch it with full expectations.",9
"So many things about this series are exceptionally good. The journey of healing and learning of each of the characters from the main leads to the various patients is very moving. Admirably tasteful way to deal with mental and emotional issues on screen. The central love story is so involving because their pain feels profound. The incomparable Seo Ye Ji as writer Ko Moon-young is unforgettable - strong and vulnerable, finally a real step forward for K drama heroines. Enjoy each sentence she utters in her signature low voice. She has some memorable and often hilarious dialogue. A far cry from the Cinderella type heroines of early melodramas. And her outfits are stunning - perfectly suited to her tiny waist.
Kim Soo-hyun is well cast as caregiver Moon Gang-tae. He isn't a larger than life hero but instead a man with pain and burdens. He looks more mature here. The pairing of the two leads is right. Much better than The King Eternal Monarch where there was little chemistry between Lee Min Ho and Kim Go Eun.
Oh Jung-se gives a likable convincing performance as autistic Moon Sang-tae, In less capable hands the character could have been annoying or tiresome but he made the brotherly relationship very touching.
The production values are very high. From the well integrated animation of the stories to the quirky Tim Burton style house, it all has a high quality feature film standard feel to it. To cap it all off the ending is a good and satisfying one. For all those who have been disappointed by unsatisfying endings in K dramas this one helps to makes up for some of them.
A must watch.",10
"IOTNBO healed me in a lot of ways. I'm gonna be so disappointed if it doesn't bag Grand Prize and Best Drama on the next Baeksang Arts Awards. Beautifully written, well-directed, and well-acted. Not to mention the superb animation which felt like watching straight out of a Tim Burton animated film. A daily reminder for everyone that ""It's okay not to be okay"".",10
"An impeccable ending, and each episode made me to learn and acting is out of the line. I just finished the drama and i will miss it for sure, the title is justified, and i recommend every one to watch .",10
"Leave aside stereotypes for a while and watch this show to understand solution to real problems we have in this world.
Writing, acting, execution and music was amazing.
As soon as you relate to characters, it becomes a beautiful emotional roller coaster for you.
Kudos to the team for such magical creation.",10
"Great story line.
Brilliant directed by Park Shin-woo.
Amazing cast with beautiful Seo Ye-ji and Handsome Kim Soo-Hyun.
Supporting actor Oh Jung-se(Sang tae) is lit.Great story building in each episode. New concept of animated story line was a great experiment by team. Easy to understand through animated graphics.
Bro-mance and Rom-Com both combo are amazing.An emotional nad heartfelt good bye to this series.",10
"Loved the unique concept of the series. The storyline, the characters, the location and its aesthetic beauty just added more to the attractiveness of the show.I was completely hooked until the very end. There are quite a few things to learn from this show. I felt i could relate to some of the events in my real life. The beautiful collaboration between a fairytale and reality was so so beautiful to witness. This is my second K-drama this year aftet Crash Landing On You and i am really glad that i watched this! :)",10
"IT'S OKAY NOT TO BE OKAY (2020)***
Haeng-ja: Humans are too weak. That's why they suffer, like your patients.
Doctor: People stick together because they're weak. We lean on each other like this. That's what makes us human. Will you ever be human?
***A beautiful story of love, friendship, brotherhood, family, autism, trust, and acceptance.Perfect screenplay! Magnificent cinematography!
Bravo to all the actors! Many thanks for adding colours to my weekends. I love Gang-tae(Kim Soo-hyun), Mun-yeong(Seo Ye-ji), and Sang-tae(Oh Jung-se) the most. I felt all their emotions. Superb actors indeed! They deserve awards for this drama. I cried on almost all of the episodes. Love the outfits of Mun-yeong. Love the soundtrack as well.This is gold! I give it a 10/10. I strongly recommend it! ??#itsokaynottobeokay

"I thought it was the best drama i've ever watched. The plot, MUA, wardrobe, message in this drama greatly presented to the viewers.But i still wondering about some mysteries that how Moon Young's mother remain alive after her dad sink her to the lake and when she says ""I will take care of my son"" before she killed Sang Tae's mother. Any thoughts?",9
"Okay, so let me start by saying I loved the whole concept of this show. The slightly ""other-worldly"" feel of it makes this show feel very different from anything I have ever seen. The acting is phenomenal, from Soo-Hyun's heartbreaking performance, to Ye-Ji's feisty, sadistic-but-fun anti-heroine, to Jeong-Se's unreal acting as an autistic man that is on par with Dustin Hoffman's Rain Man. The music is lovely, and the slow-build romance between Moon-Young and Gang-Tae is so wonderful to watch.Now for the flaw - the ""villain."" I absolutely HATED the whole plot-line of Moon-Young's evil mother. It would have been fine if she had remained dead and was just this haunting, painful roadblock for Moon-Young to get over. But instead she somehow survived a fatal fall down a staircase and being thrown into a lake by her husband? And no, this miraculous survival was never explained. Also her face completely changed, and apparently she just got plastic surgery to change her appearance, but somehow no one knew about this? Don't forget she is supposed to be an incredibly famous and popular author. And she was perfect at faking being a really nice and wonderful nurse at the psychiatric hospital that her husband just so happened to be admitted to - how did she even get the job? She just had a fake name and resume? Did no one ever check up on this woman? Honestly it was so dumb and unrealistic, and when she finally showed her ""true colors,"" she was just so over the top ""evil"" that it was laughable and totally ruined the whole mood.The show was saved by the performances of our main characters, but I'm glad they left the reveal of the mother till almost the very end, otherwise I might have stopped watching altogether. I think its worth a watch for the good reasons mentioned above, but the mother story line is something you will have to just ignore.",7
Awesome storyline. Brilliant acting. Wonderful star cast. Every episode kept getting better and better. Stellar performance by every star cast. Left me wanting more of it. Just 16 EPs wasnt enough.,10
It was such a healing drama...the character building was amazing...thanks for this beautiful journey....,10
Really really really wanted to love this drama but it's too predictable. But I loved the acting and cinematography! Specially the actress was top notch. But too much unnecessary focus on side characters. I liked the emotional views in this drama. Loved how simple his 3 wishes were! Overall I would say it's overrated.,6
"I am an Indian and watching kdrams for 7 yrs now. And I have no doubt this one is the best yet. My God, their acting was so phenomenal and realistic and not just main characters but the whole cast.
And obviously storyline was so unique and just perfect.
The end was perfect. I registered my IMDb account just so that I can rate this show .
In love with this series.",10
"IONTBO us definitely worth a watch. Some parts of the show looked somewhat inspired by Tim Burton, and some other parts like the books illustrations reminded me of the movie ""Jack and the Cuckoo Clock Heart"". The cinematography is splendid, and the script is thoughtfully written.Oh Jung Se as Moon Sang Tae played an award-winning acting as the autistic brother. I was surprised to see him being so into the character, as I saw him played another corporate role in another Kdrama. Seo Ye Ji is terrific as the beautiful, moody, anti-heroine character Mun Young, and Kim Soo Hyun as Moon Gang Tae looks balanced in complementing her.I loved how the ending provided the freedom for the three main characters. Only that I was wishing for a more explained back story of the evil Do Hui Jae ( Koo Mun Young's mother), like how she survived although she was like bleeding to death, how did she have so much money to change her face, why she was behaving like a lunatic despite being a famous writer.. which were all left unanswered. Major plothole there.The supporting characters are filled with kind hearted people who taught a lot about humanity and goodwill. Watching the show kind of opens a new window of seeing life in a different perspective, like finding happiness although life itself feels so dark and gloomy.I think I will rank this kdrama 3rd after CLOY and Descendants of the Sun.",9
"This show has absolutely changed my life in view on mental health it was astonishing amazing brilliant emotional cunning!!!!!!!!!
Absolutely adored every second and every moment of the show. Recently have discovered K dramas was but this is not only one of the best K dramas but actually one of the best dramas out there in existence in the world.",10
The best k drama i've ever seen in my life. Everything just perfect. A must see K drama.,10
"""It ain't about how hard you hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward.""This line from ""Rocky Balboa"" seemed to ring loudly in my mind as this series concluded for me. Indeed, no one goes through life unscathed, and some take even greater lumps than most. However, no matter what we've suffered, it's perseverance that matters most. Not giving up. Always push on.To my mind, K-dramas are dominating the television airwaves. While I have watched a few bad ones, most have been anywhere from great to superb. ""It's Okay to Not Be Okay"" certainly fits the ""superb"" bill for me.As several reviewers have already mentioned, this is a very unique series that deals with the mental and emotional suffering that everyone has to deal with at some point in their lives. Perhaps that is what makes the series so relatable as well as profound with the central question: when do people finally acquire the courage to take responsibility for their own lives?For so many people in this world, we blame our parents for our misfortunes and our sufferings. Why didn't they love us more? Why did they mistreat us? Where was that unconditional love we were supposed to be showered with?Unfortunately, the answers we tell ourselves are filled with as many lies as the questions we come up with. Perhaps we weren't worthy of that love. Perhaps we simply weren't good enough. No matter what answers we contrive in an attempt to ""makes sense of it all"" we, too often, play the victim.Gang-Tae is a caregiver at a local mental hospital. His body is riddled with scars given to him by patients who have lashed out at him. However, his physical scars pale in comparison to his emotional ones. In short, he truly believes he is not worth loving.Sang-Tae is Gang-Tae's older brother with fairly severe autism. He suffers from a moment in the past when he was present for his mother's murder. The murderer threatens to kill him should he ever tell anyone about it. So scarred by the event, Gang-Tae placates his brother by making sure to move every autumn of every year. He somehow wants to be free of his burden.Ko-Muen Young is a woman who was touted as a princess by her mother; someone who is head-and-shoulders above everyone else. And people should be treated with disdain and contempt for being so beneath her. This is a woman who has no idea how to interact with people. She had no filter, and therefore, speaks her mind and her feelings, both good and bad. She is a little girl desperately wanting someone to love her.The irony is that all three characters, in some way, shape or form, represent some of the most common fears and desires of every single person on this planet: to be worthy of love, to be relieved of our fears and burdens, and to simply be loved for who we are.The series masterfully navigates how all three characters are able to find peace with themselves, and perhaps, even some joy culminating in a last episode that will have you smiling and crying at the same time.Yes, it is okay to not be okay. It is okay to fall. It is okay to be knocked down. It is not okay to give up and stay down. Everyone must find the courage to get up and keep going. That is the series' central message.The performances in this series are top-notch all the way around. However, accolades must truly be given to Jeong-Se Oh (Sang-tae) who turns in a performance that easily rivals Dustin Hoffman's ""Rain Man."" In fact, to my mind, Jeong-Se Oh's performance surpasses it. He is truly deserving of any awards he might acquire for one of the best acting performances seen in a long time.This series has almost everything: a mystery, laugh-out-loud moments, heartfelt moments, cringeworthy moments, and plenty of relatable moments, depending on who you are.I cannot recommend this series highly enough. It should almost be required viewing. For perhaps, you might find some ""healing moments"" of your own as you watch this show, and be presented with the question: will you blame others for your problems? Or will you find the courage to begin living your own life?",10
"I dislike drama slash romantic shows. But for this series I will make an exception.
The storyline, the acting, perfect casting, the location, even the in story fairy tale books/stories were brilliant!!! Just brilliant. I am just blown away. And for someone who loves korean horror/zombie shows (i.e. kingdom, train to busan, etc) - that is a big thing. I am absolutely amazed by the three main leads. The supporting cast are also top notch. Its the most well cast production Ive seen so far.
This is a k-drama that I can definitely recommend. It is a brave show that tackles mental illnesses and I am so very proud how this has been done thru this show. Good on you for doing this. We need more of these shows!
I wonder if those fairy tale books are actually real books? If not, then they should be. Loved the storylines there too! and the artworks!! Love it.
And last but not the least - the female lead's outfits! OMG - just for her outfits I would watch the whole show! I dont know who she is but she carries them so well, i love her acting and i love her voice!!!! Hope to see more of you in the very near future!",10
I love moon young stories and her inference from famous stories like beauty and the beast . its a drama full of emotion thanks two wise script writer and talent actors .,10
"This story is one that will stay with me forever. The fairytale themes made the atmosphere magically beautiful, the main couple has amazing chemistry, the actors deserve all the awards for their amazing performances, the OST is incredible, everything is just perfect.It's easily my favorite K-drama of all time. Everyone should watch this :)",10
Grt series funny sad etc and make it better the actress is well BEAUTIFUL,10
"I don't get the hype really. I watched 4 episodes so far. For me I wouldn't mind if the leads were just annoying. but glorifying these annoying behaviours, I can't accept it. FL with Antisocial personality syndrome, a dark past, Different from the usual fairy tale nature of the romantic dramas. This would have made a great plot. but they focussed on the dark side of it. For eg, The assembly man's son ran away with the FL and caused a big scene at the election campaign. They showed that as FL done a good thing. I get that his father is not a good person. but what she did was not the right thing. Also Violent portrayal of scenes in a children's storybook. FL leads says it has deeper meaning to it than what is shown on the outside. But how children are supposed to understand that. But that would have been okay because the character can't really understand peoples or emotions. But the writers chose to glorify that. It is okay to not be okay. But it is not okay glorify the factors that makes them not okay.
I am gonna watch the show anyway. will update this then.",7
"Strong story and unfamiliar
I was enjoyed every minute of this drama
Top 2020 drama
Thanks for the writer and actors and producing and everyone in teamwork for this unique drama",10
"Very good story, script.
Recommend to watch for people open minded.

Lady is so beautiful, I like her and all acting is good.
To be watch!!!",9
"I love Kim Soo Hyun, let's get that out of the way first. He's the reason why I watched this show. He's a remarkable and versatile actor and devastatingly handsome. I've followed his career since Dream High and loved every one of his dramas...except this. I can see the premise of the show, and it was actually promising at the beginning. As someone who suffers from mental health issues, I could relate with that aspect of the show, although as one of the reviewers mentioned, it glamourized mental illness...that part of it I didn't like. I do appreciate the healing side of the show and how the characters eventually experience growth and transformation. I also liked how they related every episode to a fairy tale. The concept was there, the execution, not so much. Sometimes the acting was too cheesy. I even felt KSH hammed it up in certain scenes. I liked the Sang-tae actor, he deserves an award for his portrayal. I also liked the secondary characters like Juri, Jae-Soo, and Manager Lee. KSH and Seo Ye-ji did have chemistry off screen (I watched BTS too many times to know), but I personally felt something was missing from their on screen chemistry. The plot was predictable-I already knew, for instance, in episode 2 or 3 who her mother was-and the script was pretty basic. It didn't give me anything new or something to ruminate on. It was literally just a CW show with Korean actors, and one of the reviewers on here actually mentioned how the appeal of kdramas is that they are for the most part more chaste...this was pretty daring, I must say. Very Hollywood, indeed...and I guess that's the effect of kdramas becoming more internationally known, and with the Netflix crossover, one can definitely feel the Western influences on the show (e.g. music soundtrack which I felt didn't match the show's mood). There were many ship-worthy scenes, which I would like to go back to, but the beauty of Gang-tae and Moon-young's relationship was ""the chase"". Once it got to ep. 15 and 16, where the two become an item and do their business, it lost its appeal for me. It seems like the show knew what the audience wanted and gave it regardless of whether the quality was good or not. Some scenes could have been done differently or left to the imagination, but I'm obviously the minority on this. Then the villain which **spoiler alert** the show built up to be this super evil and scary witch-once she makes her reveal, she's eliminated in the same episode like a pesky fly lol a little anti-climatic. I laughed because she waited, what was it, 25 years? To have her revenge. It would have been better if she just tormented her daughter from afar. She got caught by the police so easily and wasn't much of a threat. Finally, never in real life would I buy a book by Moon-Young for a child lol what crazy parent would? And ep.16 was unnecessarily long...even felt longer than the Lord of the Rings 3's ending.",5
"By far one of the best K-drama I've seen. Kudos to Netflix for producing this masterpiece. Everything from the story line, the actors, sound tracks, costume - just wonderful. This drama will make you fall in love with the characters and side characters. Each character development is smooth and we'll thought of (not rushed like in some K-dramas where you can tell the only reason why certain things are happening is because it's near the end of the series/season).Truly entertaining, heart warming and an all around brilliant show.",10
My first time to get addicted in a drama. I love the lead cast very much. ?? The drama is beyond perfect and highly recommended to watch.o,10
The chemistry of the artists ughh I can't even explain but this by far is the best kdrama of 2020. I don't think anyone can beat it.,10
"An absolute masterpiece in every essence. The story, the acting, the feelings you get from this as are just next level. This is our second K Drama after Crash Landing On You, living in the west we have now discovered these Korean series are light years ahead of anything we have seen before. If I could rate more than a 10 I would. Lastly the actor for the role of Moon Sang-Tae Should be given an Oscar or something equivalent, his performance was literally nothing other than outstanding.",10
"The Storyline, Conflict, Plot Twist and Character Development from the beginning is very interesting to watch and follow! Also this drama also have so much meaningful Value, so that we can learn something from this drama. SYJ, KSH, OSJ played so well in this movie! Recommended to Watch!",10
"Indeed it was a human healing drama. I myself learned more about the importance of having the warmth in life, how to love myself more, how to be more patient in a stressful situations, how to deal with certain people and how to forgive people, how to think twice before action and most importantly all the humans are equal, disability or Sickness doesn't separate people into different categories, after all we all are human... Each individual is weak, So we lean on each other... no one can live alone....Such a beautiful ending, outstanding acting, all the dialogues, scenes are delivered perfectly... simply amazing!! This story will always be close to my heart...When the things are hard in life, I'll never give up, I'll start again because it's okay to not be okay.",10
"This drama Set the bar so high ! Everything is perfect from the opening to the ending. Such a masterpiece. The writing, acting, plot, cinematography, transition, screenplay, scoring, chemistrty between the actors are just on another Level. It's more than just drama, it's a life lesson.",10
"This drama set the bar too high. The Acting, writing, scoring, cinematography, transition, screenplay, plot, the use of fairy tale metaphors, the chemistry between the actors, everything is just on another Level: Such a masterpiece.! It's Okay To Not Be Okay is more than just drama. It's A Life lesson.",10
"This drama will be my always fav drama ever! I never too love drama like this, this is the first time i fell like iam very2 falling in love with drama! I love the acting of kimsohyun, soyeji, and oh jungse, they done a good job! The story was amazingggg. Tq for a writtternim, sutradara, and all of you who make this drama amazing! I hope this drama will be a daesang!",10
"Almost flawlessThe storyline is not so common
The script is just sooo good
Well written
And the cast delivered it well
Im very impressed with Sangtae character development but i love all the characters
The casts did a really good job
From such a small character to the main lead, theyre just perfect
Not to say the chemistry between Kim Soo Hyun and Seo Ye Ji is beyond the earth
The chemistry of all the casts is actually beyond the universeJust a little bit disappointed with the plot
If you watched it youll know what i mean I
m still wondering it tho
But ill just forgive it since im very satisfied with the endingThank you for creating such a masterpiece",9
The ending was a bit rushed. I wish they gave more backstory on the mother and had spent more time playing with the mother daughter relationship and the mother's return.,8
"This is truly a masterpiece from the storylines, plot twists, cinematography, osts and superb actors. Thank you for allmthe casts, staff, writers, and people behind this brilliant drama series.",10
"The Cast, The Director, Soundtrack, and the Story is truly impeccable.
Very humble drama with deeply message that can relate to its viewer.
It's Okay to Not Be Okay is a proof that it does not necessarily take a high fantasy and highly imaginative story to make a good drama like its predecessors.
The thing that It's Okay has while the other Kdrama doesn't is that they can touch the viewer with their deep meaningful story that leaves a good mark in people heart. Watching this drama is so healing, yet very entertaining. It is certainly award winning type of drama. Seo Ye Ji acting and beauty is beyond on point. She makes other K Actress in her age looks so so compared to her excellent beauty and powerful acting.",10
This drama gave us a lot of life lessons. Hats off to the amazing actors and crew for this masterpiece. Best KDrama to date.,10
"What an amazing show. I'e seen a lot of k- dramas but this one is totally different from the others. It is a blend of romance, horror, comedy and emotion. Tells us how a lonely person overcomes his fears and gets attached to the strangers and eventually finds a new family.
What makes this show a superhit is the brilliant performance by the cast and crew.",10
"It's okay not be okay can be summarized in one word, brilliant!. The drama delves deep into emotions probably you never knew you could feel. The cinematography leaves you awestruck. Each character is etched with so much care that you land up getting emotionally invested in each of them. Seo Ye Ji is brilliant as a children's author with a personality disorder. Oh Jung Se plays an autistic older brother with so much conviction and innocence, it makes you want to give him a hug every time he is on screen .Finally Kim So Hyun who plays Moon Gangte brings a simplicity and rawness to the drama.Please do watch it, you won't regret it!",10
This has been one of the most incredible dramas i've watched,10
Most of the kdramas that link to past are well connected. But in this story it was something else. Acting was too good.In first few episodes the cinematography was different and fun but later on somehow it turned into conventional,10
"This was a delightfully entertaining, emotionally compelling romance drama (with a touch of suspense)! Seo Yea Ji, by far, is my all time favorite actress: I will continually be fangirling her work no matter what character she plays! Seo Yea Ji, Kim Soo Hyun, and Oh Jung Se were exceptional in their performance together. Each one of them complimented the other perfectly to create a breathtakingly beautiful and brilliant drama: really fantastic chemistry! Wonderful narrative, excellent writing, fabulous script, and fantastic cast! Netflix does it again with an outstanding series! Bravo! Loved it!",10
"This was my first Korean Drama, gotta say this show is pretty amazing!!!",10
"I really love this drama so muchhh. The characters were good, the storyline was unique, and the fairytales part were so perfect. I enjoyed watching this and even titled this drama as the best drama this year, but......the ending?hmmm I don't think so. The ending really changed my opinion of this drama. Anticlimax. Bland ending. Or maybe I had high expectation from the ending. Many things in the ending didn't make sense from me. I'm just dissapointed with the ending but overall this drama really fun to watch, many moral values that we could learn. I have to agree with Kim Soo Hyun, 'this is a healing drama'",9
"What can I say? I am in awe!!! The first episode alone got my jaw dropping! Up to the ending, I am left speechless as to how the story remain true to its uniqueness. This drama is one of the best story written out there, and in my opinion one of the best that I have watched not only for kdrama but I would say for movies and drama series in general. This is a stand out, not your typical clichè romance comedy. Every episodes with title adapted from fairy tale stories is so unique, offer relatable life learning experience and will leave the audience with lots of quotes to ponder. To tackle mental issues and show perspective from those suffering from it was done beautifully. And to mix it with a unique love story between three main characters is something you don't see often. It is dark, mysterious, sweet, serious, romantic, comedic, healing with touch of fairy tale lovestory that is so rare and refreshing to watch. I cried, laughed, resented, giggled, and made a lot of realization. Great script, wonderful story telling, and the casts are simply amazing. The chemistry between Seo Yea-ji and Kim So Hyun is off the charts! Seo Yea-ji was born for this role. She nailed it exceptionally at each episodes as a beautiful be""witched"" fairy tale author with anti-social personality disorder but at the same time you will be moved by her emotional vulnerability, child-like attitude as her healing progresses. Kim So Hyun as always is amazing and very effective in his role as a caregiver who gave so much sacrifices for his brother, look so strong and emotionally stable from the outside but finds himself weak and still lacking in so many aspects as he thought otherwise. He chose the right story as a comeback drama series. Oh Jung-se, as I have heard is one great actor in Korea and he has proven effortlessly in this story as a 35 yr old male with autism. Their journeys to emotional healing is so touching and will leave you with feeling of sadness, happiness, joy, and the realization of what life brings us unexpectedly. Everything in this drama series is beautiful. Cinematography is exceptional, the intro at the beginning of each episodes is not to be skipped, overall the animation and visuals is so stunning, and the OST is to die for! This is a drama series worth rewatching a thousand times to constantly remind us not to judge and that everyone has a back story. To summed up, It's Okay To Not Be Okay is just simply WOW!!!",10
"I must say this drama is one of the best.
I'll make it really short.
The acting as emotions by the main cast is on another level. They really had me on an emotional rollercoaster ride.
The story is extremely unique and a well thought out story line with a major twist.
I am really happy I watched it.
Shout out to the cast and the script.",10
Not a good drama can watch if u r bored enuf will be good if its taken properly with lot of products and making and location,2
"Just finished but i am very much moved by this drama. It felt like i was moving with them in their journey. Brothers love friendhip family and loved one. Cried, laughed, scared and i am speechless. His love to his brother omg superv acting. Thank you for sharing love of joy ??????",10
"I like the actors and the story is very nice!
But.. each episode lasts almost an hour (could fit better into 30 minuts) and very few happens..
I survived 5 episodes with a lot of facebook breaks..
This is something that happens in a lot KD's lately..
Try to keep me watch without leaving.",7
"Combining fairy tale in the real life, the cinematography is so satisfying. I've been watching kdrama for more than 10yrs and this is the best I've ever watch. Try this",10
"I know we were just halfway of the year but for me this is already the best drama of 2020. When the lead actor said that we will laugh, cry, laugh, cry 'cause of this drama, he didn't lie. I'm just glad this show was made, jinjja jinjja ""human healing drama""!",10
"Watching many K-Dramas after the years I've found this to have such an intriguing and unique storyline. The details from the soundtrack, artwork, costumes, and character development were meticulously thought out. Oh Jung Se deserves an award for his role as an autistic adult--One he portrayed with dignity and deep understanding. I am from the US and I can unequivocally say that his method acting is on par with the greats. Think Eddy Redmayne in The Theory of Everything or Daniel Day Lewis in My Left Foot. As for the main characters they had a good chemistry-Seo Ye-Ji put all she had into the role and was a mysterious but ultimately playful and likeable personality. The writers really made you appreciate people for who they were despite their struggles. The nuggets of wisdom throughout the show on life, wellness and forgiveness shine through. I wish there was a second season as this show makes you want more and more. I don't normally say a show can be life changing or impactful but in this case the artistry, attention to details and careful storytelling feels like a love letter, packaged with care and hope. Truly 10/10 need more!",10
"The main leads' acting in the emotional, dramatic scenes was very good. The scene that stand out for me are when Sang-tae cries out that his older brother wants to kill him in the hospital in front of the mural. A tear slides down Ko's cheek.The songs in this drama are VERY good! I must add to my Spotify!I feel I am more understanding in mental health after watching this drama. The drama shows various patients with a variety of mental health issues including PTSD, trauma, childhood abuse, autism, etc.Moon Gang-tae and Ko Mun-yeong's kiss scenes were really, really hot. This drama mentioned sexualities, condoms and even showed the two of them assumedly naked under the covers holding on to each other.Ko's fashion style - I love her designer clothes and gothic kind of style. She wears Dior saddle bags, Louis Vuitton scarf, designer heels. The drama didn't shy away from showing brands.",8
"Specially if you have any of the problems that took place in the drama and you always felt like no one can feel or understand you.Here,you will feel understood ,you can see that others feel the same and that you never overrated the problem or overreacted. It teaches you to not keep your feelings inside you and to let them out cause if you didn't you might explode, it teaches you how love can change alot (not only relationship love but friendship and family love too) and whoever said that the ending is bad ,it's totally not but the drama is so great that we just can't
get enough
p.s:this drama helped me to face one of my own life problems and to understand it way better",10
"Watched it for Kim Soo Hyun, and then hooked by Seo Ye Ji's Moonyoung.",10
"Very dark, gloomy and depressing.How the: ""You are born like this"" about this lady justifies her being constantly rude, cruel and evil to other people and insult them, hurt them or destroy their lives?However, the psychiatric hospital is presented like a kinder garden. Really???I forced myself to watch up to episode 4. But after that I had enough. I could not continue.I am a great fan of Kdrama. I am really an addict. I have never given less than 8 stars to kdrama series. But this one was totally unacceptable for my taste.The 3 stars are only for the good actress acting, the cartoon and the cinematography. Otherwise it would be 1 star.If you are already depressed, don't see it. You will worsen.",3
This drama would be our best K-Drama of the year. It elucidates mental health. The visuals are impressive. Not your typical ROM-COM dramas. This drama is everything you need (Perfection).,10
This series is a ?masterpiece ? one of the best kdramas i've watched so far,10
"Brilliantly done with subtle and not so subtle messages threaded throughout the episodes. I can't say too much without spoiling it, but it starts out the first few episodes with some scenes that may be interpreted as quirkinesses or silly, but stay with it and you will discover such deep and profound meaning in this movie. The acting was superb and the dialogue soul piercing and moving. I have been a fan of K-dramas for 10 years and I have watched at least 70 or 80 of them and this is one of the best. I'm so glad that Netflix has started investing in original K-Dramas. I have also worked in the mental health field so I have an extra appreciation for the context of this film series. This has drama, thriller, crime, mystery, romance, all rolled into one, with a spectacular scenery to boot.",10
"I watch kdramas since 2000 and this one is by far my favorite. It's extremely entertaining and addicting. The direction, the script, the acting, the cast, the image, the soundtrack and so on are great.",10
The series has a very good mixture if expressions and the actors nailed it mainly seo ye ji and kim soo hyun,10
"GREAT STORY, STUNNING PHOTOGRAPHY, GREAT DEVELOPMENT, TOP TIER ACTORS AND ACTRESSES, FEEL-GOOD ENDING. This drama has everything go watch it if you haven't",10
"From the title, Itself ""It's Okay to Not Be Okay"" just hit the theme of the drama to be a 'healing'. This is the Best drama I watched so far. It's not about fantasy or heavy drama or a funny story but it's about how we heal with the help of others, and to help ourselves. The way how they slap the real problem in this society, just hit me, us, harshly. We connect to the drama that tells the world on what we feel, emptiness, loneliness, & abandonment. Episode 4 hit me differently when Moon-Young said ""You also won't understand me until you die."" because Gang-Tae said her to first because all his bottle up of feelings just burst. It's just no matter what status or situation you are we are still different. If you think life is hard for you to compare to others, you don't know their story, you might know the feeling & pain but we are different physically, emotionally & mentally. Don't compare your situation to others. Yours is yours, mine is mine, every one has different struggles.I'm telling you pal, you won't regret watching this drama. Best Storyline, Best Cinematography, Best Production, Best OST, Best Couple, Best Cast & Best Ending.",10
How great to have the characters evolve and keep going for the silverlining through all kinds of break ups and make ups. Love the soundtrack and score. Love the great sense of humour. Love the refreshing take on the so-called human nature. Much much appreciated I will revisit this universe for sure.,9
"Its okay not to be okay will be remembered for how it was beautifully and masterfully done from the plot , the cast, ang their acting.",10
"I'm not all about those cheese romance TV shows. But my god this was unlike most romance TV shows (and romance movies) I have seen in my life. Impossible to not fall in love with every single character. Loved every single one of them. Even the questionable ones. It's not just the romance, but the family dynamics and the friendships as well. Not to mention that manager and his secretary constantly bickering was hilarious. Undoubtedly one of my favorite shows.",9
I feel sad for all Korean drama next to this drama (It's Ok to not be Okay) because it has set such a high standard.,10
"I really loved this k-drama. Normally I don't binge dramas, but I watched this one in one week (which is fast for me). I will say I am a TOTAL chicken and a few scenes freaked me out or made me feel a little scared, but if you are a chicken you should be okay. I think I was more startled bc I wasn't expecting that from this show based on reviews and recommendations. The character development builds really well and the show keeps a good pace the entire time. This is not one that will disappoint you in the end or leave you confused. There were only a few MINOR plot holes, but overall pretty good. This is also a little bit of a heavier drama, but there are some comedic moments. It's worth it for the romance, they have a strong screen chemistry.",9
"As my title says, this drama is certainly different from what I've seen until now, and it's good, really good. And the actors do a marvelous job.
This drama will get you through a very large spectrum of emotions. So it's a must-see. It really is.",10
"I have watched many noteworthy titles like Goblin, you who came from the stars, descendants of the sun etc. Nothing even comes close to the near perfection of this drama.
With such a brilliant cast, the emotions on the screen seem very much real.
This drama is a sure keep and my applause to the cast, director, script and last but the best the OST. Just brilliant!!",10
"The story is wonderful, but something is missing from the plot I think.. so that's why it's 9/10. Everything else is perfect. The cast, how they act, the screenplay, storytelling, and of course the main thing in this kdrama is the emotion, the connection, and the messages.. it's simply the best.finished watching at *10/08/2020*",9
"As an expert in this field, I see all sides of humanity. I've learned that everyone has a story... For the most part, this series was accurate. If you want to see the many sides of mental illness and how we become who we are, and the courage it takes to heal, please do yourself a favor and experience this. I cannot recommend this enough. Stellar performances from the leading and supporting characters. Adorable moments and heartbreaking at the same time. Do not miss this.",10
"After the first two episodes I was surprised of the dark humour, it looked a bit like a Tim Burton Tale. It's not a too big spoiler to say that this develops to a very deep love story. There are other K-Dramas with a more surprising screenplay. But not so many with just a good and likeable cast, a great cinematography and deep interest to its characters.",9
"There is a lot to love about this show. Great characters with interesting personalities, story-telling and animation, some dark themes. It culminates in a touching ending that for me made me miss the characters once it was over.",8
"Best Kdrama I've seen in a long time. Everything from the visuals, castings, OSts, storyline, etc... is just spot on. A well produced drama that tops all kdramas byfar. Its atypical.",10
"While watching last hour of show I was happiest person. The complete show is emotional rollercoaster throughout. I'm really proud of Moon sang tae ! Each character with its unique storyline and something to tell you, teach you.
It isn't just cliche HEA. Wonderful soundtracks, lovable and tearful.",10
"Am pretty old for this.However I've registered this accnt.for IMDB just to rate this Drama. & this Drama is Unique & portrayed well. As I would rather say that ""I have an elder Brother who's been A Psychiatrict patient for more than 35yrs. & it's not because he wanted to,' its because he could not over come it"". Anyway , Kudos to all the Cast specially The Trio ( Seo Yea Ji,Kim Soo Hyun , Oh Jung Se)who made the whole story meaningful. Its A package & Beyond Expectation!??????. CONGRATS HOPE TO SEE THIS DRAMA IN UPCOMING AWARDS.",10
"I hardly give any reviews or should I say close to none at all. I have watched gazillion kdramas and to be honest it's very hard for one to penetrate in my top 10 list and this just barged right into my top 5. The narrative, the score, the cinematography, the casting, the plot and the direction, everything was flawless. The actors brought out the role of their characters so well, the score gave the perfect feel during the moments and the fairytale graphic was an ingenious idea that made me emersed into the story that it felt like a vivid dream. This is not just a drama, it's an experience that I'm glad I did. It's a slice of life and I honestly found place in some beautiful scripted dialogues and especially the name itself couldn't have been more apt for this drama. It's okay, to not be okay.",10
"Binged 22hrs of TV perfection in 4 days!
The message is so important and if you strip away some of the KDrama eccentricities, we can all relate to the pain these characters went through, the effects on their mental health and (spoiler alert) how they found healing. I really related to the one of the male leads in how he sacrificed his happiness to look after his brother - all apart from his ridiculous good looks.I strongly recommend watching it and if you've never watched a Kdrama before here's my breakdown of what to expect:
Episodes 1-3: what is going on? But... I'm falling in love with the female lead (Seo Ye-Ji)
Episode 4: First cry. OK I'm invested now and I'm in love with the female lead.
Episodes 5-13: You'll laugh, cry and repeat. Also who needs sleep! Same feelings about the female lead
Episode 14: I don't want this to end
Episode 16: WOW!Special mention to the actor Jeong-se Oh who plays the autistic character Sang Tae. - what a performance! Incredible acting.In these dark 'rona times, we need a show like this. Stick with it - you wont be disappointed. Did I mention I was in love with the female lead?",10
Could had be done in 10 episodes but still amazing!A roller coaster of emotions and a stunning production.Jung-se Oh acting is so good! One of the best performance I recently saw!Give it a try :),9
"Watching this really gave me emotional roller coaster, the issues about mental healtiness really hit me. And thank you for seo yea ji, kom soo hyun, and oh jung see for amazing performance and the cinematography in this drama REALLY AMAZING. Thanks for director and screenwriter for give us many parallel scene, really smart move!",10
"Settled acting by the lead pair and main characters
Screenplay, cinematography, taking, production values everything was too good...",10
One of the best tv series with some very important topics related to mental health (which have been portrayed very well). Excellent acting by all the characters.And amazing sizzling chemistry between the lead pairs. Do watch this show BRILLIANT ????????????,10
"It's Okay Not To Be Okay is something that I would recommend. Not a heavy drama but it will surely touch your heart. I personally fell in love with each of the characters because they all have that 'factor', all of them contributing to the very beauty of the film, to feel love and to feel loved.",9
"I specifically just made an account to leave this review. Simply amazing.
The subjects covered in this series, the acting and the cinematography was perfect. Oh Jung Se played his role spectacularly, I was in tears again and again watching his amazing portrayal of an autistic older brother. If you're in two minds whether or not to watch this believe me, you should watch it.
Brilliant.",10
Recommended and must watch movie series. I could rate this above 10 if ever there is.,10
"I recommend you to watch this serie, it had smtng particular",10
"Thanks for the awesome performance of all actors and actresses. This drama brings me so much tears and laughs. It teaches me a lot of love and forgiveness, courage and self-development among family memebers and friends and peers. One of the best dramas in 2020!",10
"I've seen a lot of kdramas before and this one is by far the best. Unique female lead character which is well portrayed by Seo Yeji, and I like how strong her personality is. It's not your your usual kdrama female lead. Kim Soo Hyun is as usual, his over the top acting, he wouldn't have had those daesang awards for nothing. Every emotion can also be seen in his eyes, which is sooo amazing. Actually all the three of them (SYJ, KSH, OJS).. I was laughing, crying, then laughing again.. It's a roller coaster ride of emotions. And I love how the tables have turned at the last episode hahaha, that was epic.. I hope KSH and SYJ will be paired again in the future which is impossible since they change partners in every project they do.. IT'S A MUST WATCH KDRAMA. YOU WILL NOT REGRET WATCHING IT.",10
"The best kdrama I've watched so far. It's message and the topic about mental illness makes it much more worth it to watch!! Highly recommended! The acting is super great and stunning! They portrayed the roles accurately! Also, the chemistry of syj and ksh!!! AaaaaAaaah!",10
"I almost skipped on watching this title because originally I thought it was made by Netflix, I am really glad I watched it. It's an amazing KDrama and one of a kind acting from all the actors. A roller coaster of feelings. It has its cheesy moments but still a 10 in my book, it kept things entertaining from start to the end.Fortunately Netflix was not involved in the making of this show, because lately they ruin everything they touch. Luckily they just stream it on their platform so its not a cheap PC production like the usual Netflix stuff.",10
"This is by far the best kdrama in 2020
The chemistry from the main leads are crazy
The cinematography is gorgeous
The story is really good!",10
"Best actress and actor. Without Ko Mun-young , Moon Gang-tae can't perform perfectly! It's a perfect pairing! The chemistry of them in the drama is just awesome. Every part of their acting and dialogues is worth watching. And Sang-tae's exceptional performance in every episodes, he is so good. Not forgetting all the other actors and actresses in this drama, and especially the director Park Shin-woo and writer Jo Yong. All of you will be recognised for your hard work and efforts!I am sure this healing drama touched all our hearts and we want to see more of Seo Yea-ji and Kim Soo-hyun! Also Oh Jung-se! We want more of this!Pls sell your merchandises! (If can, even the books with Kor and English words)A fan from Msia.",10
"If there is 1 notable good thing that happened this 2020, it is this drama release! It surprised and healed me beyond expectations and measures. I thought everything about this year is heaviness and tears, but I was wrong. And in my 20 years of watching Korean series, I can confidently say that this is one of the best - from the offbeat actors, to the cinematography, screenplay and soundtrack. Not everything is perfect but if you're into character-driven story, this is going to take you to another level if watching!",10
"It is one of the best romantic series I watched. It will definitely in my top5. It's a simple story two people falling in love and overcoming emotional and physiological wonds.
It's different from usual kdrama and you wouldn't get bored for a single minute. The chemistry background songs were more than perfect. I didn't want it to end. It's more than just romantic series,I didn't want to say the spoilers.
Please watch it , it will make you laughf , cry and happy .",9
"Literally a human healing drama it's so perfect not only the plot the cast, production scenarios ALL is PERFECT ....",10
"Wow! That was an exciting ride. I stumbled upon It's okay to not be okay (IOTNBO) accidentally on social media. Actually, that title made me search more about it. And I was hooked from the beginning. Never thought I would see such a beautiful animation in a Korean Drama! That intro was amazing.
The story style, colours, artworks and the soundtrack are so beautiful. They give a fresh and unique experience to the viewers. Hats off to the creators for adding up these artistic vibes to the drama. I enjoyed the way how KMY storybooks intertwined with the original story.IOTNBO mainly deals with mental health. If you listen closely from every character, you learn something for life. Friendship, family, love and drama - it has everything that a typical KDrama has, but it's so much more than that.
Also, I must say the scenes with the patients in the hospital are so powerful. I can't express how much respect and gratitude I feel for caregivers in the health industry.Thank you cast, you all were absolutely brilliant!
Good job Netflix, Thank you for giving a chance to this unique story!",10
"This is a series for 12+ of age. It's mostly a series written for children. Very childish. I wish some Korean series drama/romance are for the older target groups. It wasn't bad, but the series consists of 16 episodes. I only found it most interesting when something major happened and that was towards the ending of the series. It's a very soft storyline, nothing really exciting. All I was thinking during the first 6 episodes, okay a big spoilt woman with problems is harassing the man with words. The man is also having problems and you have to wait like 10 episodes until something romantic happens. Before this it's only staring eyes and some soft/romantic music while they stare in each others eyes. If you have plenty enough time and like slow and soft series you can watch this. If you are an adult and also like more adult series and a little bit faster paced series don't watch this. It will bore you.",5

"In the midst of this pandemic this drama literally save me. It more just a drama. It's a MASTERPIECE!! From the casts, story, cinematography, all in all was superb! No dull moments. You will definitely feel all kinds of emotions while watching. Highly recommended! The chemistry of the lead actor and actress was one of the highlights of the story. You will definitely fall in love with them.",10
I watched and was bewitched with k dramaI just don't get this one. I am dragging my feet just trying to reach the finish lineI can think of 10 plus series that I watched and are better than this yet lower ratingStands out the brothers immense role as a person with special needs.The story for the last 4 eoiseds 3 to 7 is not moving forward.Every 130 mins a small hint of something.Very average and unless the ending is wotkd shattering very disappointing,5
"First of all,I watched this k-drama without expectations.But when the two episodes were on air i decided to watch it .So the introduction of the story with creepy animations wow hooked me inmediately .The three characters whose performance was amazing , made me fall in love with the story.The meaningful fairy tales were a plus to love the whole K-drama.As the actors said it's a healing drama which people could feel identified by the story.I cried many times,sometimes i felt like ko Moung young and sometimes like Moon Gang tae .In addition,the excellent performance of Oh Yung Se is undeniable.But i feel identified more with Moon Gang tae since he's ordinary like many of us that apparently we are okay but in reality we hide our emotions ,we're suffering and struggling with our past demons.Finally,the edition,OST and the strong chemistry between the protagonists made this show my favorite .So that's why this k-drama deserves everything in the world .If you are not hooked with the story, you can try to watch the show later beacuse i think a k-drama has its magic at the right moment.When you're suffering what the protagonists went through ,that's the right time to watch this amazing show .Definitely you must watch it!!?????????????????????????????????????????????????????",10
"I've watched a lot of Korean dramas and this is by far the one that hit me hard right through my heart. I can relate to Moon Gang Tae a lot. Everyone deserves a standing ovation if it was a theatre play. Every aspect of the drama from cinematography, animation (can i just say that the animation was like from a Tim Burton movie), story, ost, lead character's chemistry, award-winning acting from the casts, everything in it deserves a recognition. i love it so much and i'm rewatching it every now and then.",10
"The best actors with the best acting.!
And it contains a lot of informative content.!",8
"The best actors with the best acting.!
Contains lots of informative content.!",8
One of the best dramas I've watched and the actors really did a great job with their roles. Plus the chemistry of KSH and SYJ is on a different level. Will recommend it!,10
"This is probably the FINEST foreign TV-series I've ever watched! It taught me some great lessons that will definitely make impact in my life.
The TV-series shows that our life isn't perfect at all, nobody is 100% good or bad in character, and we might not get the ""Happy Ending"" in our lives, because this is real life, & we've to deal with things throughout it.",10
"This movie was the best
Kim soohyun and seo ye ji were wondeful",10
"First of all what a cast we've got here specially Seo Ye-ji (Ko Moonyoung) and Oh Jung-se (Moon Sangtae) they were just stunning make me cried at some times and even relate with my darkest and saddest self and thoughts.
This is not a happy fairytale, its the most enjoyable darkest fairytale with some ups and lots of downs but at the end you felt happy, satisfied and just different.
I loved It and I loved Ko Moonyoung book stories.",9
"Without a doubt, this series is the best South Korean series has been ever made in history without exaggeration.
In the beginning, I was not really interested in this show, but the perfect acting of its actors made me convinced that I would continue watching and with each episode the series' magnificence, enthusiasm and events increased. I want to talk about Soo-hyun Kim and Ye-ji Seo
They are undoubtedly the best original Drian romance story and their representation is convincing and realistic without making a frequent occurrence in all the other Korean soap operas.
This is the best Korean series and it makes the rest of the series garbage next to it.
Rate 9 but give it 10.",10
"I Started Watching This Show Before my Exams And Yet I'm Watching It And My Exams Are tomorrow.
Yaa This Show Has Good Endings at each Episode Which Will Lead you To watch second episode immediately.There are Sometimes When I Think That I'm watching something like Bollywood But Storyline Is Great So No complaints.
just Watch The Show Without Knowing Anything about it You'll enjoy it more.
Watching Your First Kdrama Watch This You Won't Regret it.",9
"This master piece will change your life.
You will get really motivated if your life is not going in the way u want.You will become different.",10
"I have recently stepped into the world of kdrama with CLOY and then stumbled upon this gem. Loved the story, the way the story is told, the performances from all the actors and the cinematography. Everything is so perfect. I fell in love with Kim Soo Hyun and Seo Ye Ji together. Their chemistry is beyond beautiful and natural. Everytime they kissed my heart did a summersault, it felt so genuine and intense. The character developments thoughtout the series of all the chatacters are amazing. I feel like this show is very under appreciated among kdrama lovers. Do give it a watch and I am sure it won't be regretted..",10
"The cinematography is excellent. It's clear that this was a big-budget drama meant to supersede previous K-dramas in filming quality. However, the whole premise is dull--garden variety sociopath falls for a stiff, self-abnegating man afraid of love. And pursues him. This is their story. I lost interest by the 4th episode. Unless there are interesting distractions, like wars, zombies, challenging primogeniture, escaping enemy territory, etc. a drama that focus entirely on a romance can become boring very quickly. It's better when the romance is part of a larger story and isn't the sole focus on the drama. After enduring the dragging pace and lack of stimulation I switched to another K-drama, ""Kingdom"", for more thrills.",7
"Best drama ever , i love this drama so muchActors , edits , storyline everything is a best",10
"This show is very special.
Here's why:OUSTANDING acting performances by the whole cast, especially the main cast though. While Kim Soo Hyun has been one of my faves for a while and is the best paid actor in Korea, Seo Ye Ji and Oh Jung Se captured my heart with their performance. I truly hope they finally get the recognition they deserve.UNIQUE plot with a rarely approached social issue, specifically in dramas: mental health and how to deal with people who have mental health issuesBEAUTIFUL storytelling and screeningEMOTIONAL journey: I laughed, I cried, I shivered. I was happy, I was sad, I was scared, I was angry.FUN FACT: I've never cried as much as I did watching this series LOL (but please note that this isn't an entirely depressing show because it's not!)This show made its way into my TOP 2 dramas next to Crash Landing On You.",10
"A total surprise, going into this i thought it was going to be just a well made series with nothing really impressive about it... i was wrong.The three mains on this are just unbelievable, the story is interesting throughout the entire series, at no point feels boring or overwhelming, the character archs are paid off in a compelling way, some of you will probably tear. The support characters are relevant and have a great development, by the end you will miss them too.
And the story is just fantastic, the fact the episodes are long allows the story to breathe and feel like taking a pause (while still developing the story in a compelling way). Im just in love with this show, i have no regrets going into this, loved it and enjoyed it all the way through.",10
"Great drama, from the first episode to the last one. The actors are amazing, almost all of them. The psychological developments of the main characters are really well done, showing us the pain and heal they go through step by step. Sang-Tae is definitely the most lovely character ever.",10
"By far this is the most beautiful Kdrama I've watched that despite of the limitations due to covid the production was able to deliver awesome shots. Cinematography is impeccable. The 2 leads act as if they were really made each other. So much to learn even the side stories. Truthfully, this is a human healing drama... superb craftsmanship!!!",10
"This is the first time ever i got addicted this much to a kdrama. The storyline is very unique ,bringing mental health issue and inserting a fairytale on it,each episode has a moral value. The cast are really great..I was amazed , they are really into their characters well. The cinematography is stunning, The ost are great too!",10
"Seriously this drama so good at showing mental health issues so well and actors chemistry is phenomenal. And seo yea ji is so good at playing moon young ,her voice is no words to describe how good and sexy is !!",10
"Shed a lot of tears on this one. I really enjoyed the story. Even though it takes longer time for me to finish it. I'm glad that I didn't give up. I'm gonna miss all of them, specially, Sang-Tae oppa. <3 I love the tandem of Gang-Tae & Mun-yeong.",8
"It's the best romantic k- Drama series I have watched ever..Kim soo-hyun and seo-yea-ji have a true love chemistry between them and it can be seen on-screen as well...I loved the character played by both of them and their acting.The song breathe is simply breath-taking.I can watch it again and again .
And it has a perfect fairy tale ending.",10
""" It's okay to not be okay "" is a conceptional drama. It nailed the atmosphere and the whole gothic, fairytale, mysterious, dark and eerie. The addition of the books worked fantastically, the setting was brilliant and the clothes of the leading lady influential.The story, however, of the drama was stretched. Looking back into it, nothing happened for some episodes, and the final result was the kind of 'easy' conclusion of the whole mother mystery. The side stories were underdeveloped and boring too. So, no, they didn't work on the story too much, as they focused on the clever dialogue and the atmosphere.Nevertheless, even though storywise my rating would have been 5.5, I can't really rate it less than 7 because of the performances. The three main actors were breathtaking, especially in the dramatic scenes and one should only watch it for those performances only! (and no, I'm not a fan of the actors, but I can't stress enough how excellent they were! plz give them an award!!)So, overall, seven out of ten (10/10 for the actors, 5/10 for the story)",7
"I absolutely loved ""It's okay not to be okay"". Great message, great characters, great chemistry and plot. The cinematography was amazing and really loved the animations as well. Moon Gang-Tae was perfect and very well written, and Sang-Tae really adorable and cute. The slowburn romance between Seo Ye-ji and Gang-Tae was wonderful. Ps. The mental health issues were nicely done, wish more dramas did this!",10
"The usage of fairy tales and central themes definitely kept the show grounded and focused. The show takes this even further by using familiar fairy tales to allow the audience to understand the characters better.From the very beginning, I had quite a few concerns about the show. For starters, it is about mental illness, and they are showing this to a predominantly Asian community who has never really had much content to deal with when it comes to the subject matter. The portrayal can either be glorified, derailed, or dull to the point the story won't really connect to the audience. Another issue was the murder plot, and how that could easily derail the story. These two concerns lingered until the end since the conclusion was really the only factor that can decide whether they were valid concerns or not.After finishing the show not just once, or twice, but three times (and counting), I am glad those concerns were invalidated, and it is obvious the writers made and effort to ensure none of them would be. Even better, the writers drive home the title of the series by showing that even until the end, none of the characters, both minor and major, are completely recovered, rightfully going against the idea that mental illnesses behave similarly to many physical illnesses which can be cured completely.The casting was beyond spot-on. Kim Soo Hyun's status as well as the nature of his previous roles makes his role in this show even more remarkable. We are so used to seeing him be so alluring not only in terms of his looks, but his characters' personalities in general. As I started this show, I was expecting him to be just as or even more alluring than he was before. Instead, I felt frustration (in a good way) towards his character's behavior, making me feel conflicted as this was not how I was used to seeing him. He looked glorious in the show but in terms of how his character was written, that was the best thing about him. To me, this is the role where his character felt the most humanized. He was perfectly imperfect, and he played it perfectly.I had never heard or seen Seo Yea Ji before this, and after watching her performance, it makes me wonder how many more underrated and insanely talented Korean actresses there are that I have not discovered. She not only played her role, but she EMBODIED it. She definitely had several shining moments. I also felt conflicted towards her character. Her intentions were wrong, but it seems that she can read people better than they can read themselves. She ends up doing the right thing for all the wrong reasons. In that sense, I loved how her character played out this way.I think it is worth noting that their humanized portrayal of a character with high functioning autism. I think they drove home the point that Sang Tae was different than others, but definitely not incapable, not just in terms of taking care of himself but of those around him as well. And just like every other character with this show, he too had mental health issues to deal with and flaws in his character that affected his relationship with others and his growth as a person. Making each character dimensional was just the list of things that has yet to be commended for with this show. And just like his co-leads, Oh Jung Se delivered a hell of a performance.Looking at the wider picture, this show does have international implications. The success internationally is one thing, but it does lead you to wonder how well Asian productions can stand against their western counterparts in terms of creating quality content. The writers of this show wanted to deliver a heart-felt story and from the beginning until the end, they clearly stayed with that purpose. The show was filmed stunningly and was written beautifully and creatively. The gist of the story was fairly simple, but the delivery is incredible. As a watcher from the US, it is painful to see the reception of this show not be as great as the dull, problematic TV shows gaining high viewership ratings.",10
"It is indeed a human healing drama full of messages and life lessons. At first, I thought the story would be like another typical rom-com kdrama but my guess was wrong. I already captivated by the visual storytelling from the first episode.All of the actors are well casted and their superb acting were really satisfying.In my humble opinion, what made this drama unique is the way it successfully conveyed the messages on mental health with its mature acting and meaningful dialogue. I learnt a lot of things thanks to Its Okay to Not Be Okay. Totally worth to watch.",10
"It's OK to Not Be OK is a splendidly told tale, beautifully produced, solidly written and featuring outstanding performances from the three leads and super-solid work from a large and talented supporting case.The story is set largely in and around a psychiatric hospital but where it would seem that the three leading characters are themselves in grave need of being institutionalized. The leading man, Moon Gang-tae, played by Kim Soo-yun, plays a caregiver with infinite patience who must live his entire life in slavery to his autistic brother, Sang-tae, outstandingly portrayed by the veteran actor Oh Jung-se, to a point where he is clinically depressed because of the relentless grind. He needs therapy, support, and, truth be told, a day off and a roll in the hay - none of which he ever allows himself to take (despite the fact that two beautiful women are on his case). Even when he has the opportunity to spend the night with one of them, he is so overcome with guilt and depression that he treats her beyond shabbily and then abases himself to his brother, who as can be expected reinforces his humiliation. Sang-tae is not to be blamed for this - he can't help himself - but, for a long time, all the mental health professionals surrounding Gang-tae ignore his obvious symptoms and needs and do little to help him to find balance. This enables a series of dramatic moments, to be sure, but it occasionally lends an air of unreality to the proceedings.The leading lady, Ko Mun-yeong, brilliantly acted by the sublimely beautiful Seo Ye-ji, is also a non-inmate, equally if not more in need of therapy. She plays a best-selling author of somewhat twisted children's fairy tales, with a knack for speaking the unfiltered truth about anything and everything in a way that is excruciatingly uncomfortable for her interlocutors. (I will never forget the lecture to the patients in which she reinterprets Beauty and the Beast as an example of Stockholm syndrome.). For all her self-centered personality, she is, nevertheless, the first person who gives non-material help to Gang-tae. (Everyone else just offers food or a place to stay.) At one point, she asks him straight out the crucial question, ""Are you going to sacrifice your whole life to atone for your sin towards your brother?"", a sin that he had not in fact committed. You have to ask yourself why it is Mun-yeong, and not the health professionals, who first has this insight.Sang-tae completes the trio. He is a talented illustrator but his gifts are overshadowed by his classically autistic personality, which makes him heavily dependent on his brother. Like Mun-yeong, however, he is a speaker of truth and he catches on in an instant if his brother is lying to him or trying to control him with petty deceits.The show's conceit is that these three heavily damaged individuals will find in each other the means to overcome their misery and the traumas of their past lives which, this being a KDrama, are deeply and somewhat unnecessarily intertwined. It's a slow burning process. In a flashback to one point in their childhood, Mun-yeong witnesses Sang-tae fall through the thin ice of a frozen lake. At first, Gang-tae, knowing already that he has been condemned by his mother to a life of servitude to his brother, runs away, but he relents goes back and saves him. Gang-tae in turn needs rescuing from the icy waters, and Mun-yeong throws him a float that keeps him from drowning. When they meet again years later, Mun-yeong slowly falls in love with him (as he with her) and, often against her own selfish instincts (or perhaps to gratify them), she tries to rescue him from his all-encompassing misery.Similarly, Gang-tae tries, at times, to help Mun-yeong overcome her worst self. No one else seems to think that she needs therapy or some other form of intervention. They just complain about her.And Mun-yeong and Sang-tae form an unlikely bond. It begins unpropitiously, with Mun-yeong trying to get close to Sang-tae as a way to break through Gang-tae's iron reserve but in the end, a genuine working collaboration and mutual friendship transcends their relationship with Gang-tae - in one delightful scene at the end, the two force Gang-tae out of the room while they working together on a book. I suspect that people familiar with autism will find some (not all) of Gang-tae's behavior in the later scenes suspiciously un-autistic, but on the whole the show portrays mental health issues in general and autism in particular with great sympathy and some considerable delicacy.There is, perhaps, some artificiality to the whole affair and it is not helped by some of the more irritating tropes of Korean dramas - repeated eavesdropping, characters get drunk, toss up and then forget everything, the incessant arm-grabbing (although for once the women do it almost as much as the men), and the frequency of scenes involving meals, including several irritating Subway product placements.Among the supporting performances, some shout-outs: Kim Chang-wan as the hospital director, Kim-Joo-hun and Park Jin-hoo as the much put upon publishers of Mun-yeong's books, and in a bravura cameo turn, Kwak Dong-yeon as a patient who, with a major assist from Mun-yeong, hilariously disrupts his father's political campaign. There are many others. Perhaps the weakest is the young but very busy TV actress Park Kyu-young, as Nam Ju-ri, a nurse and long-time friend of the brothers, who is appealing but bland, probably because the part is not well-thought out. She descends from a leading role as a true rival for Gang-tae's affections to a distraction who hangs around many episodes after that triangle has been definitively resolved in Mun-yeong's favor.What makes this show so watchable are all the extraordinary performances, lead and supporting, and the engaging character development and situational comedy and occasional drama that are more important than the relatively thin plot. The production values are strong and the use of Mun-yeong's fairy tales, especially the book she writes at the end with Sang-tae's illustrations, is moving and lovely. And I would be remiss not to mention the beauteous Seo Ye-ji's stunning fashions. They are striking but there is no questioning how much she adds to them. In the language of books, this is a page turner. Sixteen hour long plus episodes never felt excessive.",9
It heals my wounds.The casts and their chemistry are overflowing.,10
"This is the best drama of the year in my opinion, this drama is not about love but there are lots of lessons about life that can be learned in this drama, thank you for creating a very good drama for the writer and for seo ye ji, kim soo hyun, oh jung se for the amazing acting, staff and crew who worked hard to create this drama",10
"IOTNBO indeed contains a different storyline than most of the dramas. I really enjoyed watching it. Pairing is cute!! The drama was mixture of Reality, mental health issues, touch of comedy moments etc! But one thing is that, it's imbd is overrated. Lot's of dramas out there with amazing storyline, famous too but their ratings is between 8-8.9. I feel this drama is overrated if you think about it properly. Otherwise I liked it!!!!??",8
"I like this tv show but i think its a little overrated
i mean acting and cinematography is great but everything else is normal
this is a honest review
this series is 7/10 not more not less
so long !",7
"Very impressive extraordinary action with psychology elements between the writer and the worker in the institute.
also need to mention the brother who act wonderfully as a illness person",6
"It's probably one of the best shows I've ever seen because in a way, it has a bit of many genres including drama, romance, comedy, and even mystery. Kim Soo hyun is truly mesmerizing. You can expect the best story with the most exceptional actors, please spend your precious time watching this series and you won't be disappointed.",10
"This show is one of the greatest shows i have ever seen.It is one of those shows that after you watched it, you wish you had amnesia so you could watch it as the first time once again.It mixes comedy and romance with intriguing and unique characters, and it also blend some elements of storytelling in a very unique way.
Which really gets you hooked.
The first episode is used as a complete setup for the entire series and characters, which is very risky but it certainly paid off.
The chemistry between the cast is so intense that it really hooks you right in.
The script is magnificent and the music fits perfectly to every scene.
If you like a good story and being emotionally grabbed, this series wont disappoint in the slightest!!A clear 10/10 from me!",10
The cast in this series are all talented and the character development is amazing,10

Amazing drama indeed!! You will not regret watching it! Highly recommended!!,10
"It's ok to not be ok is a HEALING DRAMA, It is not even asking us to like the characters. It is not asking us to approve of their actions. The most it is asking is for us to push the limits of our empathy, so we can understand where these characters are coming from.At first you may not like attitude/action of main lead(specially the female lead),I put myself to understand these character why they became like that, I am curious and I am not going to put the blame on one character to another.Story might be simple, but the acting really incredible!!kudos to the all cast and production of these drama.Overall, this drama really has placed in my heart, it hits me a lot maybe because we can be all like Gang-tae, Sang-tae, and Munyeong in real life. 100/10",10
"This drama is marvelous, best cast, best pd, best writer. This drama set the bar so high for other drama. I m not even drama lover/movie , i am not the one who will give my time to watch some show, but this drama made fall deeper in to it and rewacht this drama is my way rn, ahha

"First, lets congratulate all the team who work on this drama.
I found the story really relatable to our mental especially with this kind of situation. All people tend to be at home figuring out what's really wrong with their life and this drama will give you some massive help to get answer to this question ""whats wrong with my life?"" you should watch it the whole episode, and you'll know if your life seems wrong just go out with campervan. Go watch it seriously.",10

"This drama is so incredible. I have enjoyed this drama since day 1. It leaves a lot of lessons to viewers. The storyline is very relevant to the social issues nowadays. Plus, the actors gave justice to their characters well. The three leads have given stellar performances throughout the entire drama.
This is not a typical k-drama. This is one of a kind!",10
"I have an attention deficit disorder when talking about movies or shows on TV but with this particular drama, I was hooked like a leach. This drama not only depicts the meaning of true love but also the meaning of we are okay not matter what our circumstances maybe.I love the characters Moon Gang-Tae and Ko Mun-Yeong and how they balanced each other out. I want to see more of this duo on tv and on screen, hopefully this is not the last we're going to see them because it would be a shame.This is by far the best that happened in 20/20 for me. I am not an avid K Drama fan, I was able to finish the entire thing with my being so lack of interest in a long drama series but this one keep me and myself glued to the tv every week and I am still rewatching it every now and then. Some of the episodes are my happy pill.The chemistry of this two main characters are undeniably on fire! I mean, they are perfect for each other in reel and in real life so hopefully they found each other perfect too. The chemistry of the Moon brothers are so beautiful that you envy their relationship towards each other. Sang-Tae's character is so good, I've seen him mostly as villains in some other KDrama but with this, you fall in love with him. The relationship between bestfriends are also shown in this series and I want a bestfriend like that. The loyalty, the trust, the love and the respect for each other is beautifully crafted in this series.Glad I was hooked and now I am a big fan!. Highly recommend, if you have a hard time reading the subtitles in English, you can rewind and watch it again. Each episodes made you cry, laugh, and love it!I tell myself now Saikojiman Gwaenchanha. It's Okay to Not Be Okay!Happy watching!",10
"I have been watching kdrams from quite a long time but this show is amazing better than DOTS, GOBLIN and any other popular KDrama ..the way it presents various illnesses and emotions is amazing",10
"Indeed, a human-healing drama. It gives comfort and there's so many lessons in this drama that you can apply in real life. Relatable and very timely. I love also the visuals of main characters (Soo Hyun Kim & Ye Ji Seo) they are perfect and fit together. Their acting along with Jung Se Oh and other actors is superb.. I hope this will get a lot of recognition not only in Korea but also internationally. They are all deserving for giving us this kind of series. For me for all K-drama I've watched this is the best. Really the best. Shout out to Seo Ye Ji.. She's the prettiest actress and super versatile. I love her so much.",10
AMAZING ACTING PLOT VISUAL FASHION....great life lessons...,10
It have connected one way ir another to everyone watching this but at the end there will be smile and warm hearted feeling of acceptance that it sure is ok to not be okay.,10
"Best Korean drama I have ever seen!! It tackles about mental health, this drama help me understand mentally ill people more.",10
This is the best drama i've ever watched.. The story telling from the start to the end. The healing process.per episode by each character.. Best acting..best animated pictures.. All in all the best. This story is not all about love or what this story was a healing story for every one who had a bad past or a traumatic experienced who is not ready to overcome.this story gives me a life lessons per episodes. I love this drama super.,10

And finally you can say, it's okay to not be okay!",10
Its been two months already since it ended and i still feel so attached with the story and the characters. How to move on ?!?!?! This show will always have a special place in my heart and will always be on my top tier list. And its sooo good it hurts ????????,10
So happy that there are so many reviews and so many votes in such a short time. What should I say about the great grade ? AMAZING! I am literally going to recommend this to all my acquaintances even though they are not into Kdramas at all. I have to make sure to convince them to watch this because it is absolutely fabulous. Made me cry so hard and laugh with all mt heart at the same time. I have to search some lines and note then down just because the're too good. Just as you note quotes from books. That's impressive! I'm gonna stop here otherwise people will think I exaggerate but honestly..I'm not!,10
"During the pandemic disease of Covid 19, we need some kind of the ways out for our emotions and feeling. This series is the one that we need for our ways out of fears, worries, anxiety and stressing. I would recommend you to watch. The actors and actresses are so talented and the main actress is really cute and scary. And I loved it souch. Thanks Netflix for such a romance and comedy.",10
"Enough said!!! This is the Best Kdrama of 2020. The best assembly of cast, director and screenwriter. The Best in cinematography and editing. Dont forget the well-loved OST's. It is hard to move on. Nothing can beat this drama.",10
"From the beginning to the end, everything feels energized. The making of the drama is very detailed, the script writer makes the audience dive into the story, made curious, but there is an important point that wants to be conveyed to cure mental illness. and the three best players make this drama very loved. congrats for the good drama ever.",10
One of the best masterpiece. Not even missed a single moment of seeing it. Its very interesting story. Great acting by lead roles as well as support roles persons. One of the best i ever seen .,10
"A couple of really good kissing scenes that aren't as conservative as most k-dramas.
Storyline is unique and there are a lot of powerful hidden messages.
The only let down for me was that the 'twist' and 'culprit' reveal was short lived, it felt like the build up was highly anticipated but then it was all over in minutes.
The main actor Kim Soo-Hyun was very good in this series, i didn't like him in ""My Love from the Star"" (as he seemed insignificant and overshadowed by the lead actress) but in this drama his acting was very memorable. The supporting actors were also very well portrayed especially the brother with autism, excellent acting from Oh Jung-se.
Overall, a must-watch drama filled with a captivating storyline, powerful life messages, and sweet romance with great kissing.",9
"This has got to be the most overrated kdrama ever. It's okay but definitely not better than other kdramas that have lower ratings like Crash Landing On You, Descendants of the Sun and Guardian: The Lonely and Great God (Goblin). It glamorizes mental illness, condones sexual harassment, has hammed acting and an unbelievable storyline for a villain.",7
"Absolutely love this drama!! Each and every episode was a masterpiece !!
The plot.. story line.. the cast.. the acting omg.. the dresses
Everything was so so perfect !!
Absolutely must watch drama !!
Straight up perfection !",10
In my opinion the direction and character development is one of the best that I have seen. I just didn't want it to end.,10
"I really loved this show, the acting is great and the storyline is really unique. It's dark but the funny and sweet parts balance it out. I won't give spoilers but I think it ended well. I highly recommend it!!",10
"I have watched so many KDramas but this us my first time writing a review for one because I just couldn't stop myself. This drama is a complete masterpiece. I was reluctant at first thinking that it would've been a sad melodrama and would have left me crying and sobbing for days, which I didn't want. But I was so wrong! This gives me a kick and life lessons which no other drama could, and this is not those typical KDramas which have a not-so-significant female lead. The female lead is the most powerful, and the male is such a good match for her, a great human being. It tells us how someone can enter our life surprisingly and turning it upside down, making it much better than it was, and your loneliness vanishes. It teaches the importance of love and warmth in our empty lives. Overall, one must give it a go. The acting is terrific, and, you'll remember the kiss forever ;)",10
"A MUST Watch... Perfekt couple! The chemistry are inevitable! love story, comedy",10
"I don't usually watch foreign work because I'm not a fan of subtitles, but my daughter talked me into this one.
I was hooked after the first episode.
Fantastic writing, gifted acting, incredible insight into the world of mental health.
I HIGHLY recommend this series.",10
"I GOT HEALED WATCHING THIS. VISUAL, CINEMATOGRAPHY, OST, 10/10",10
"It's an okay drama for me, it's a bit overrated, but is the head nurse really is mun yeong's mother ? how did she survived from the fall and being thrown into the lake ?",5
"This is one of those series that leaves a mark on your heart. A moral for each story, a beautiful depiction of what is means to be dependable. The hidden truth behind the weight of mental illnesses. The songs, the stories, the laughs and the sadness. I wouldn't miss it. And I will any day watch it all over again.",9
"I don't usually write on here about anything but the unique story, the acting, the characters and every little part of this show made it impossible to not write my appreciation for it.I'm am amazed and In love with this Drama. I don't want to spoil it for anyone who reads this but I needed to just say that anyone that comes across this drama should give it a go. It's honestly the best series I've seen all year and one of the best I've seen ever.",10
"Cute show, I'm addicted. Must watch for all :)",10
"Look if you are looking for a Kdrama that is gonna be so engaging and compelling that your tempted to keep watching from beginning to end straight without breaks this isn't it. The storyline is there but there are also a lot of scenes that are just time filler.Basically most of the characters in the drama have a troubled past and come together in this hospital. Seo Ye-ji has a slightly annoying yet bearable because of her stunning appearance character. Soo-Hyun's character is the best part because he is pretty normal and balanced and Oh Jung-Se acts superbly well for his role but the character he plays can be a little frustrating. You need to be patient with this Drama because some parts can be outright boring.As far as the screenplay and the visuals its awesome. The dialogues are pretty good, nothing crazy but some memorable messages. There is hardly any action and very little comedic relief.This drama is definitely darker, creepy, and on a more serious note than your typically kdrama. If your into that type of stuff you'll like this. If you like a fast pace, lovey-dovey, hilarious drama you are not gonna like this one that much. There is a love story but its very calculated and mature.The drama is good really only in the beginning 5 episodes and the last 4 episodes. It really picks up at the end.I might sound a little critical but I don't really see why everybody is acting like this is the greatest drama ever. yes it has a good message on overcoming the past and facing obstacles and so on but from an entertainment perspective I wish it was a little better.",7
This is THE drama that got me so hooked that it was the first K-drama I watched in years. Seo Ye Ji's and Kim Soo Hyun's acting are phenomenal. Watching the show is a given! It has a plot that is like no other drama.,10
"Excellent drama,perfect portrayal of characters,very good script,excellent cast and crew.director and writer are well coordinated.overall perfect",10
"This show is magical. It's not something that you would witness before. It will keep you hooked from the beginning till the end. And will make you want to re-watch again and again. Instead of skipping, you will be rewinding to watch a scene to hang on to every word of the dialogue, every eye movement, and every small detail. Even the soundtrack is hauntingly beautiful.This show addresses autism, alcoholism, anti social disorder, depression, being lonely and a lot of other mental health issues and finally will give you comfort and closure. This human healing drama is not just about its main characters, every single character has their own story and you will watch it again and again to focus on each of them, to watch their story unravel, to live through their pain, to witness how they overcome these difficulties and rise up like a beautiful butterfly.",10
One and only kdrama that gives not only inspiration but also a healing,10
"This is my very first K-Drama that I have watched after Full House (that aired at least a decade ago). So, I was able to watch this with a fresh mind, with no expectations. I didn't know who the leads were, having not watched any K-Drama/ movie before therefore, I guess I can write an unbiased review as I am impartial to any of ""fandoms"".
I initially watched this because there was nothing else to watch in Netflix. This kept on getting suggested to me and I gave in. What I didn't know was that it would turn out to be one of the BEST dramas I've ever watched!Where to begin?
The cast: The whole cast (not just the leads) are quite talented. I believe that each and every cast member helped to breath life to their characters. It was as if I was looking into lives of real people with real emotions who have had their own live problems and are trying to overcome them by leaning on each other.The lead characters were exceptional. Especially the actor who played the character of the brother with autism. I have a cousin sister with autism and I was amazed at how accurate his portrayal was. For many episodes I actually believed it was a real person with autism not just an actor doing a great job!
Moving on to the main couple, Ko Moon Young, the female lead with anti personal disorder (I believe she was misdiagnosed), is one of a kind character. At first she is rude, obnoxious, and borderline obsessive. It is quite easy to dislike such a character. But, the actress pulled this difficult task with elegance, style and grace that you can't help but fall in love with her even before the male lead would. She has the best character arc in the show going on to become the most lovable and warm character at the end.
I found the male lead to be quite normal when compared to the other two, however, he is not always likeable. He has his faults, he is not a knight in shining armor, he too makes mistakes and sometimes does not even correct them just like a typical human being would do. It was a realistic portrayal of a man being pressured to take care of his brother with autism all his life, sacrificing all his needs. We see the story from his perspective.The Story/ Writing: I should say the writer and the team has paid attention to every small detail of the story. The way things connect just marveled me. The dialogues are not cheesy or unrealistic. It's quite thoughtful and meaningful and though provoking. There are many relatable quotes that you can take away from this show.
Also, there are few books that were written by the scriptwriter her self! These books, if you get your hands on them, are great as well. Each book contains a children's story that is acting as a cry for help from Ko Moong Young. You will see each story's significance when you watch this drama.Directing: I believe the director and the production team has paid attention to every small angle, lighting, view and even every breath by actors! It is quite exceptional how magical some scenes were!Soundtrack: It is hauntingly beautiful and funny when it needs to be. I loved every OSTOverall Verdict: Highly recommended.",10
"I am a male American, used to American movies, dialect, and character plots, but never in my life have I seen an actress with a steaming sexuality as Ye-ji Seo's character. I would see her as Eve in the garden.My wife and I thoroughly enjoy Kdramas, but with this one I should keep my comments to myself.I really appreciate Kdramas that are not about silly youthfulness, and trading characters, or yet traveling into time. That is an over used plot line that cannot go further, but this drama, being a suspenseful, somewhat erotic in a safe nature, and well acted, fits my love for the Korean film industry.The actors of both the protagonist and his autistic brother has a feel of real brotherhood and compassion. A word that does not any longer fit our lexicon. Refreshing to see.Watch it!",10
"With everything that is happening this year, this show is what everyone needed. It is the most comforting and satisfying drama I watched, be it Asian or Western. The main trio's characters are perfectly portrayed and their chemistry and acting are top notch. I'm truly impressed!",10
It's such a great drama. Different but splendid. I totally love it.,10
This was probably the best drama i've ever watched!! I've watched it 3 times now and I will watch it many more times. The cast here is really something. They perform on this drama soo good. You can practically feel every emotion they send to us. I love it and I highly recommend this drama to everyone.,10
"Just amazing!! Great acting, character development everything is just perfect",10
"Thank you to this drama series, i hv learn a lot, how to not judge based on people appearance, how importance love and warmth is. Thank you for those beautiful journey that you have shown to us.",10
"I love it, watch it, then you know. You will experience a lot of emotions through this drama. The 2020 best drama for me.",10
"Full of good words.
I like all ost from this drama.
Top tier acting from all the cast.
I like how they portray the development of each character from this drama.
Overall, the best.",10
"Master piece.
Kim soo hyun's acting is amazing
Storyline is so good
Moon young beautiful
Sang tae cool",10
"I rarely watch on-going dramas but this drama is too good from the first episode.
really recommend everyone to watch.
all the casts are perfect- Oh Jung Se really potrayed Sang Tae well that it makes me think he really have an autism irl haha
Seo Yeaji no doubt, been following her for so long and she did very well potraying mun yeong. you can feel all the pain through her eyes. she cried, i cried. bascially, they cried, i cried.
Kim soo hyun, this is the best character of him, for me. This is the most matured character he played and i really love kang tae.plot wise, kuddos! seriously, worth watching and worth my 10 stars!!",10
"The story, soundtrack, location, character back stories and character development are all great! my heart will always remember this kdrama because of how it made me feel. the final episode was amazing, that's one of the kdrama ending that i really liked because I've seen the characters happy, unlike other kdrama ending where i wanted to see more.. with ""its okay not to be okay"" it was very satisfying, there's closure, it made me cry and smile at the same time. i will never forget that last scene of Munyeong, Gangtae and Sangtae.",10
"The story revolves around a hard-working man named Kang Tae whose older brother has autism, and Kang Tae alone has to solve his older brother's problems and sufferings, and at the same time make a living.All the problems, in addition to the memory of the murder of a mother who makes her brother nervous, go hand in hand so that Kang Tae's character dedicates his whole life to his only property, his brother.In this muon, Kang Tae meets the beloved writer of his brother, Kang Muyung, who is a bold, reckless woman with strange and exaggerated thoughts and exaggeration.In the first place, the strange relationship between Kang Tae and Muyung comes to the viewer's eyes, and this is where the story begins. Muyong is looking to take over Kang Tae because Kang Tae, unlike other men, stands in front of him and is an interesting creature for Muyong .Screenplay process:The story begins with a fantasy theme. Storytelling whose stories are contrary to the usual narrative process. Old myths such as Cinderella and Snow White and all the old classic stories that have long conveyed a message of goodness and love to the reader, are completely questioned. He looks at them from another angle, and it is interesting that the viewer realizes that yes, he can look at the stories from both positive and negative points, and we ask ourselves really why he has ever looked at this story from this aspect. We did not look, and basically, why is this instrumental and clichéd look repeated from the past to the present?The words that Muyung says in all honesty and sincerity are scary for the viewer. Because the beautiful world changes and changes our childhood dreams.Kang Tae, on the other hand, is a man who constantly runs away from Muyung because he has his brother's problem. His life is hard enough and he gets involved with Muyong and the past that is hard in his mind and for this reason he starts to run away, but Muyong knows Kang Tae is an interesting creature that he wants to get to tempt him. To control his unbridled thoughts and minds.Character buildingA series in every sense of the word. Because the characters had exactly all the details and points they should have. Muyong has a scary past and his father intended to kill him as a child. On the other hand, he saw the murder of his mother and lived in a strange place and strange thoughts were transmitted to him and made him a strange unrestrained woman. Someone who only pursues his childish desires. Kang ta is one of these desires.Unlike Muyung, Kang Tae is a very simple man who even has repetitive clothes that do not fit him at all and only involve his brother's problems.On the other hand, we have the autistic character of Kang Tae's brother, a man who witnessed the murder of his mother as a child, and this has caused him to show signs of panic and nervous movements by seeing signs.These three main characters guide the story well.positive pointsI think it was one of the brainstorming stories that came out recently. I liked the idea behind the story. Two different characters, like two sides of the same coin, who unfortunately both had some kind of mental and subcutaneous problems, and these problems had made their lives difficult.Muyung is an unbridled girl who was raised as a child with high self-confidence. Being superior and on the other hand being obedient to her mother had made a strange potion that this character appeared every time with an accident. This woman has an exaggerated and special behavior from head to toe. That all signs of inner personality. Well done to the author. At the beginning of the story, I thought that the director had just given Cinderella-like clothes and strange make-up and haircuts to Muyong to show her beauty, but the further I went, the more I realized the director's trick. The director has shown high self-confidence and lack of attention to Muyong. On the other hand, because he did not like her as a child, he does not have normal social behavior. Do not worry about the discomfort of those around you and be frank. And Jon, a mother with a mental illness, had strange thoughts surrounding him. Interestingly, this character has used this weakness and now he has become famous and rich. Now, in the midst of all this, he is facing Kang Tae.Kang Tae was also a man who grew up with a bitter reality as a child. ""You were born to take care of your brother."" And this case has involved Katg Teh all his life and made him a very self-sacrificing man who, if he wants to take a step away from this sacrifice, will suffer a pang of conscience. And this character is now acquainted with Muyong.Screenplay process:The story had good skeleton and skeleton and had a good theme and plot. The part where the author creates stories as Muyung was very interesting to me. Different from all the children's stories I have ever read. Each had a different message, and these messages were clearly visible in the text of the story.Like the story of a mother who does all the work for her child and when she asks the child to walk and do something, she sees that the child has neither hands nor feet. This was one of the most meaningful stories I have ever read. The concept of beauty means that we must allow children to explore the world on their own.Or the story of a child who ate meat. The first mother starts giving meat to the animals of the village and sacrifices her hands and feet when there is nothing left. But he sees that the child only wanted a warmth of love from his mother.Congratulations to the author on the stories being extremely amazing. A concept from Muyong's past life in which his mother played a major role.The illustration space was very rough. That cursed castle with that basement or sanatorium is not a problem. Well, it has a good reference to the name of the story.I also liked the humor of the work, despite the fact that it has sharp and bitter parts, but it had interesting humor, such as Kang wearing a suit and Muyung making him jealousThe actors were extremely good at portraying the story very well. Especially Kang Tae's brother, who played the role of an autistic man well.The music of the work, except for one OST, I liked the rest of the design and it sounded goodExcellent directing and editing. I loved editing the work immensely.The episodes that were cut were attractive to the viewer or the combination of animation with the story gave an imaginative and dreamy atmosphere to the story space that did not bother the viewer in any way.end of the storyI would prefer that both characters be completely cured. That the characters become good with love is nothing more than a myth, and some of the psychological problems that have their roots in people's childhood are not easily solved with love. Even if it is solved for a short time, it still shows itself after a deeper period than before.But in general, because the series was fantasy and sweet, I reject this point as a sub-syllable.In the end, I will gladly give this series a score of nine and a half, and I will definitely recommend it to almost everyone as a good psychological series.",10
I've never written a review before but this drama needed a review. The way this drama was written and filmed was so unique. The acting of the cast is so amazing. No random side stories that have nothing to do with the whole story. Any side stories parallel with the main story. It is a fairy tail but a dark fairy tale and I loved it.,10
"Great title BTW, which never hurts. It's also the official slogan for OK Psychiatric Hospital, a facility by the ocean where Gang Tae ( Kim Soo Hyun ) is a caregiver. He lives with/cares for his older, autistic brother Sang Tae ( Oh Jung Se ) until an eccentric, anti-social author of dark children's books called Moon Young ( Seo Ye Ji ) crashes into their lives.
This is a good, sometimes very good series which doesn't reach the exalted heights of my top shelf ( 30 But 17, While You Were Sleeping, Hotel Del Luna, S1 of Welcome To Waikiki ) due to some frustrating script/directing issues.
What they do get right is that critical central relationship. Yes, it's knee-deep in the sort of incestuous ( as in growing up next door to your future girlfriend ) tragedy endemic to K-Drama, yet the characters are vividly drawn & the bumpy progression towards a real ""family"" is a joy to watch. And speaking of vivid, I'm sure every young actress in Korea was chasing the part : it's a juicy role that not only embraces all human emotions but it's also fun. She gets to say whatever she thinks with no thought for consequences, which includes calling out fools where required & abusing anyone in her way. The male lead isn't nearly as colourfully written, yet is handled equally well.
Handled not so well is an alleged relationship between the author's loud-mouthed publisher & a nurse at the hospital. The script lets them down, while his long-suffering assistant ( such a scene-stealer in While You Were Sleeping ) is wasted apart from the very end. I was also dismayed by how the visual fun of the first few eps is abandoned thereafter, though the show does look good in general and a gothic, Tim Burton vibe is noticeable. And kissing ? There's a bit, & there should've been more; early on, SYJ makes some very raunchy comments in public, but the director coyly cops out later & not because SYJ was just wanting attention.
So casting a gorgeous lead pairing is no guarantee of success ( as proven in Backstreet Rookie ), though it works magnificently here & the chemistry sizzles. KSH has more of the dramatic chores to do & is impressive, while the husky-voiced, ultra-charismatic SYJ dominates the screen whenever she appears. OJS as the brother is effective & the boss of the hospital is enjoyably avuncular & ready with a smile when there's chaos all around.
The ending ? So important in my opinion & leaves a sour taste if it's mediocre. The finale here is thankfully satisfying & left me in tears.",8
I love it becuz of the romance parts and the exciting storyline,9
Some of the characters are truly fascinating like the cranky psychiatrist. But the romantic plot was a hoax in itself.,8
"This show really hits differently. The story is very special and well delivered. Topics of mental health, trust, friendship and love are brought upon. I really love that we see the perspective of the world from an autistic person. This drama has heavy and heartaching scenes, but also comic, and is pleasant to watch. Solid plot, strong dialogue, exceptional cinematography and visuals, professional acting and great chemistry, and beautiful soundtrack.
Highly recommended show!",10
"In the beginning it was bit scary. And then i become intrigued of the story of the writer and so with the caregiver. Their story resembles alot in real life situation. I cant find the answer to my questions in real life, their story can give you a boost and hint. Thumbs up. I had watched them twice in a row. ??????",10
My own opinion this is the best kdrama i have ever watched for this year... or for the whole decade,10
"Best drama for me next to The Queen's Gambit :) love the plot, cinematography, the actors and their acting are superb!",10
"This is a mix drama of romance,fun and little horrifying things .
Go ahead watch this ????",9
"This is the first time I'm writing a review and man I just can't stop myself from writing one.
This show is literally a MASTERPIECE. Each episode is awesome in its own way. The actors/actresses, storyline, soundtracks, emotions everything are just amazing. A must watch show!!!",10
"Of all dramas i have watched so far, this tops the list for now. All the actors including the side actors and not only the main actors have completely justified their roles. The way of illustrating emotions through books was beautifully shown. A must watch! Lot's of love to the team for creating a master piece!!!",10
I must visit south Korea someday. Excellent cinematography and a matching Storyline.After the world of the married and now it's okay not to be okay..,10
"This was the first kdrama i watched and i was completely pleased. The story and the characters were written and portrayed so well, and all the cast members had the best chemistry so it was amazing and i got really attached to it. And i have been craving a second season ever since. 1 is not enough.",10
"This is hands down, the best K-Drama that I've watched so far. It takes you on a roller coaster of emotions from having you laughing till you can't breath to sobbing and blowing your nostrils into mountains of tissues. Not many people can say that a tv show can help change your view on life but I truly can say that this drama has. It teaches life lessons and portrays hardships that people go through in such a soulful and ethereal manner that it leaves you starstruck. All in all, even if you've never watched Korean dramas, this is the type of drama that everyone can enjoy with their friends and family.",9
"It reminds me of wizard of oz. The OST music, lighting, way it's filmed, acting, character development was superb. The topic of unrequited love, jealously, anger, resentment, loneliness, lost of love ones, ptsd, guilt and a bunch of other emotions. The actors perfected portray the characters.",10
"This is my favorite drama of all time. I love all of the characters inside, except for the villain. Love the couple, also his brother. This is a must-watched drama. The healing side of this drama healed me a lot. The development of the characters made my heart fluttered. This drama is so amazing, not like the other romantic dramas with the cheesy moment. The romance gave me the tension of the real couple. Hard for me to move on from this drama.",10
"Love this drama a lot since the first episode. Love for the characters Ko Moon Young, Moon Gang Tae, and Moon Sang Tae, our three main leads. Love the romance side, also love the sibling's side.",10
"The intro is good, but I didn't find the first episode interesting as a whole. The camera shots were awesome as well as the transitions. What I like about the series is the way the female lead expresses her thoughts implicitly. The children stories laid out for each episode also contributed in making this series better. This drama also let you see the two sides of a story as well as the characters. All characters are flawed and made beautifully. A suggestion for improvement is to lessen the dull moments and fill each episode with more happenings. It was ended well though, I really like it. The female lead is also funny especially in episode 9.",7
"I watched this drama more than 20 times (looks really toxic indeed), but I like it more, never get bored. After watching it over and over again, I realized that even the small details in this drama have a very deep meaning. This drama changed my perspective, the way I saw the world.I also have a brother with autism and as a child I often felt that my parents treated me unfairly, I was considered like the wind in the family. But through this drama, I recovered, my pain slowly disappeared.For people who think this drama is boring. I don't think they know what ""empathy"" means. understanding this drama requires a very high level of empathy, and a very deep analysis.This drama has many profound meanings. It is true as the saying goes, only those who suffer will understand what suffering is. Thank you for bringing this beautiful drama into my life. I love this so much. I will never forget it.",10
"Since there are already so many glowing comments about this show, I won't go into detail on how incredible I thought it was in every possible way. Suffice to say, I couldn't tear my heart or my eyes away. Zero cliches, a deep story with complex, non-standard characters, delivered by compelling performances from the whole cast. Even the ending (where many KDramas tend to come apart or fade away) was beautiful, tightly written and satisfying. Truly KDrama at it's finest. Don't be put off by the uninspiring synopsis on Netflix and just watch it. You won't be sorry.ROMANCE RATING: 8/10 * * *There were only ~3 kiss scenes, however the ones that we got were romantic and passionate, with sizzling chemistry between the lead characters. Viewers are also treated to a few unexpected fan service shots, courtesy of Kim Soo-Hyun's impressive torso and washboard abs.",10
"I love about this series is the overall story. Casts are stunning and perfectly fit to the character they portraits. The cinematography, acting, settings, and story that you can really relate to. I recommend this series a 100% must watch.",10
"Anyone who haven't watched this series yet? Then you must right now. I'm speechless actually. Everything I have been expecting in numerous series / dramas I've watched and known, this ""It's Okay to Not Be Okay"" K-Drama is the answer. HAHA. The casts, genre, story, ""everything"" was made me addicted to it.",10
"Out of all the shows I've watched, this has left me with the worst post-drama depression ever. I can't describe or understand why exactly I am so invested in the characters, ESPECIALLY GANG TAE AND MUN YEONG. Ever since I finished it, my heart aches every time I think about the show. It's like a void that will never be filled, in the most beautiful way possible. I love it so much and I really hope they somehow renew this for another season, although unlikely. The chemistry between the actors kills me, each scene they're together hurts me even if it's a happy one. I loved the magical realism and the little details they put into the plot, which just further enhanced the great acting of all the actors. If you're planning to watch this, I recommend preparing yourself 'cause you're gonna feel empty for a while after finishing it. Try to not miss anything and dedicate your full attention when watching it - that's how you'll enjoy it the most. I don't think I have ever shipped a couple so much, the dynamics and their backstories and the way they healed through each other are just perfect. The tension and the stares during those sweet and intimate scenes are what really pushed me off the edge. And of course, the funniest faces and lines at the most unexpected moments. I am 100% sure that this will probably be my favorite k-drama forever, I got so lost in their world and I find myself going back to it every now and then. I find comfort in them and I've gotten so used to it all. The familiarity you'll develop with the show is the best part of everything. I don't think I'd ever be the same again, I love the way I feel whenever I watch/think about it, it makes me smile and cry at the same time. My greatest wish is for these two to work together on the same project again, even if it's not for a season 2 of IOTNBO.",10
"I was looking for something a bit different and stumbled across this. I'd heard about it but had no idea it was a Korean title so ended up being my introduction to Korean TV and really, the review title sums it up, 'just wow'. This was an emotional rollercoaster from episode 1 right through to the very end, the characters really draw you in and make you part of their journey from being so well scripted and well acted by all.Thank you to all involved in this production.",10
"2 words: Seo yeji.
I hope that OH JUNG SE Get the reconsideration he deserves, his acting is everything also soo Hyun was a really good gang tae
Everything is letterly an art",10
"I don't write reviews. However after seeing so many great reviews I felt like I had to say something. This was the most boring k-drama I have ever watched! Nothing actually happens it's just people talking. I understand how some people are saying ""it has real themes!"" and how great the portrayal of autism was etc etc..
Yes great to see autism being showcased in a series with real themes however based on just the entertainment value of this series I could not continue after episode 11. I was bored several episodes ago but kept on watching waiting for something to happen which nothing did and I just felt like I wasted my time.",2
"I didn't want to watch this drama at first. The first episode was quite boring. In the end, I can say this is definitely the best TV series I've watched so far!!! So so powerful, true, it shows different aspects of life in a unique way. I just loved it so much. I even miss every single character because they are so good and I'm so sad I finished this!! If you're looking for something different, true, powerful, well made and even fun, watch this show. It's worth your time!",10
This k-drama is amazing! I can't describe its extraordinariness with words. Definitely the best k-drama I've ever watched in my whole life!,10
This drama is great only because of the acting of Oh Jung-Se / Moon Sang- and the wardrobe of Ko Mun-Yeong / Seo Ye-Ji.,5
"This was my first time watching a Korean drama and I have to say I am very glad I did. The cinematography is simply stunning, and the parts were all played very well. Definitely worth a watch.",9
"I loved everything in this series, the cast, the story, the direction, the ending, the main character's chemistry
It's my new favorite KDrama!
I give it 200/10",10
"I'm not even finished yet; I think I have like 3 episodes left till the end, but I really wanted to go ahead rate this already to express just how much I LOVE this drama right now!!! ???????????? It's pretty addicting too!",10
I'm new to korean drama's and this one is the best tv series i have ever seen.,10
"Story is epic. Each and every episode is fascinating and engaging as to what will happen next.
Songs are so good that i downloaded all the songs right away.
Cast is superb, great acting by Kim Soo Hyun , Seo Yea Ji and Oh Jung Sae .
Saranghae to the show and especially Kim Soo Hyun ?",10
LOVE THIS DRAMA OMG???? love Gang Tae and Munyeong,10
"I shed tears unabashly during the last episode. This K-drama certainly outshine everyone. To be fair, each K-drama has it's own merit, be it Rom-com, thriller action etc. But this one dares to be different. From the acting, which is superb, every character is so well portrayed by the actor you are instantly drawn into their lives, you share with them their pain, joy... their ups and downs. praise to the Director, the script writer and everyone involved in making this awesome story. K-drama has come of age. Spinning a story of mental health, coupling with love, fears, weakness of human nature is no means feat.
If you watched K-dramas before, you will enjoy this one. I have no reservation recommending you watch this one. If you never watch another K movie this is the one not to miss. Enjoy. You can thank me later.",10
"What a captivating story filled with excellent acting and cinematography that made me, a 23 year old man, cry wholeheartedly many times both out of sadness and happiness.
I genuinely cannot nitpick even a single thing that could've been done better, I loved it all and was glued to the screen for the past few days.",10
"What I liked
1. A merge between fairytale and real-life themed storyline
2. Major character arc
3. Cinematography
4. Realistic portrayal of struggle with emotions and mental health
5. Brilliant acting and dialoguesWhat I didn't like.
1. Acceptance of toxic behaviourThis show has encaptured all possible emotions in a box and sprinkled it across the storyline like fairy dust. I can't get enough of how beautifully the story evolves. This show is not just about romance, it's about-
1. Strong family bonds with people irrespective of bloodlines.
2. How our childhood experiences or the past, both haunts and keeps us alive.
3. People with mental illness are humans too, they need extra strength to come out of the box
4. We don't belong to others, we belong to ourselves
5. Human beings are weak so we should lean on each other to become invincible.
6. Butterfly means psyche, some may see it as madness, and some- cure.
There are numerous little reminders like this throughout the show.
I also loved how the creators gave us a complete picture of the story that will proceed after the show ends. That's some next-level passion for storytelling.Along with this, I want to point out Ko-mun-Yeong's toxic behaviour towards Gung-tae. I understand her pain and her behaviour, but I sometimes felt her controlling behaviour was accepted and barely addressed. Even in the end, her controlling behaviour is just joked about. No matter how much love exists in a relationship, that level of need to control your partner is never okay.This show will always be in my memories- the honesty of this show is one of a kind.",9
"Each character is unique and clever. The acting is superb especially Kim soo hyun portray moon gang tae character is amazing. This drama is funny yet heartbreaking, I also cried and laughed at every episode. Overall, this drama is worth watching.",10
"Wow. What an outstanding drama, and one I am so so sad to have finished. The acting, the music, the story, the atmosphere - everything just worked so well, and it quickly became one of those 'ach we'll just squeeze in one more episode' shows that my partner and I watch (despite each episode being roughly 1 hour 20!). I ended up getting so attached to each character, and their individual stories, and thought that the way this programme handled mental health was so beautifully done. The acting was excellent from all, but especially from the actor who played Sang-tae (Oh Jung-se) - his acting was nothing short of phenomenal. I only wish I was watching this magical piece of art for the first time again.",10
"Beautifully written, the actors were great, the storyline was excellent. I loved the unique take it had on fairy tale stories. It was a masterpiece loved it as much as kill me Heal me",10
"A heart touching series that i love.. You need to be patient for the first episode, but later on it goes best",10
"This show is absolutely amazing. The message that the title alone sends is inspiring, and by the time the rollercoaster is over you will be pumping the brakes wishing the ride would never end. I really loved the music, and the atmosphere they had throughout the show. It was quite mesmerizing and even hypnotic at times. The fact that the actor and actress actually had the disorders they were portraying brought an incredible level of authenticity to their performance, and that authenticity really carried the story well from beginning to end. It is a very layered and complex story with many well developed characters. It will definitely leave you deeply moved with an inspiration to grow in your own life.",10
Beautiful! Amazing! Wow! Just Wow! I have no words to describe this drama. Every episode is better then the one before. I really loved it.,10
The acting in this series is out of this world. The character development is perfect and realistic. Beautiful cinematography. Amazing supporting characters. If I was to look for a weakness it would have to be that the plot might be a little bit too complicated. The characters and acting alone could carry this show and some conflicts are unnecessary. Overall it is the best show I've ever watched. It is very close to perfect.,10
"I had a little bit of a hard time connecting in the first few episodes because I had no idea what I was watching to be honest!! LOL! But trust me when I say that this series takes a complete 360 and becomes something completely captivating. An emotional, thrilling, heart warming ride! I was not expecting this series to become what it did. Such an amazing and wonderful series. Full of so much story, heart, emotion, trauma including childhood trauma, friendship, romance, family etc. The 3 main characters just grab your heart and never let go. The whole cast is amazing really! Give this one a shot if you love Korean dramas!",10
"I do not know how to describe my feeling now, i just wish the story will never end. Love the couple and the reserve characteristic for both the main role. Feeling so unacceptable for the drama has already ended that quick. (sob)(sob)",10
"It contains lots of msgs.. For daily life..
& It's completely different from the typical k-drama /C-dram Or any other series... ??
Highly recommend...
I can assure ....you won't regret",10
I love this show Is Have not watched something like this before.... Misterious... Funny... Awesome...,10
"I don't know where to start. I've never written a review to begin with, and I've seen a lot of shows. This was my first introduction to kdrama. And what a beautiful and emotional ride it was. The story is wonderful and tragic at the same time. And what a brilliant preformance from all of the actors. I've never seen a show quite like this and I can't stop thinking about it. Everyone should see it - it touches some heavy topics in a brilliant way. It is absolutely one of my top dramas I've ever seen, and let me tell you, that says a lot. If you haven't seen it - do it. You won't be dissapointed!!",9
"After watching this, i have a hard time finding anything that can live up to the exitement, and quality of this k-drama. I am no film-expert but i have never seen anything with that level of personal development.",10
"It's not the romance that's most captivating about this story, but the way they all struggle with their own demons(hardships), and understand each other, because they know what pain feels like. It's just so real and so raw, that you see the pain they go through, and you feel every emotion, strongly.It really exposes us to how people can look so perfect, so successful, but be hurting on the inside, and it takes strong people, that are forced to grow up quickly, that know how to survive, but lack the one thing that makes them difficult to be understood from the rest: normalcy. You see these characters develop a loving-something they've long to feel-relationship with one another. How they come together and lift each other up, not realizing how much their strengths and weaknesses help one another, is just, unforgettable. What a lovely, impactful, love story-with all 3 members.",10
Such a wonderful series. Artistic and emotional and surprising! Addictive!!,10
Best korean drama ... I have ever seen...I love it,10
Story is very nice i love the character of ko moon young.,10
Well i am a huge fan of romance genre but only quality series of movie. So i watch very little romance but i see something different and memorable. This series is so beautiful and lovely i almost cried while watching it and i didn't wanted it to get over. It is perfectly balanced and perfectly casted series. It surpasses my expectations and i am totally in love with the series along with the cast which i love and will miss... lots of love to the team,10
Beautiful- sadness- loneliness- creative- dark- heartbreaking- mysterious- romance- disorders- happiness- friendship- horror- and much more. A good watch. It will not disappoint you. I loved it !,10
"I don't even know how many times I watched this series over and over because I couldn't quite get over it. The storyline, cinematography, and the cast is quite unmatched, as it also emphasises several mental health issues. 10000000/10",10
"Simply , This is a wonderful family Drama. I have seen a lot of dramas including Korean dramas. Usually Korean dramas are cheesy, funny, exciting and romantic. There is usually a bad person at the top of the chain and finally the good wins. But this is like no other. Every single episode was unbelievable. specially the first 4 episodes. I am going to watch this again as this drama can actually teach you many things about life. This is a wonderful drama which must be recognized and watched universally. Bravo. from a Sri Lankan Biritish fan.",10
Love it so much this show got me back into kdrama its so different just my typeee.,10
"A perfect show with everything perfect. Whether it's acting or cinematography or storyline, the show has always gave us a perfect episode. The ending was soo satisfying. I strongly recommend the show to those people who want to watch something extraordinary, in its own way.",10
I didn't like the first episode but after that I was captivated for this show. Superb acting by Oh Jeong and Kim Soo. I hope both won awards for leading and supporting role. Very well done!,9
"This is one of my favourite series! One of the best Korean series that I would recommend.I honestly watch this series because Seo Yeji or Ko Munyoung in this series. I really love her cute face and her deep voice. I hoped she would get more main role in series. And yes!! She got a very nice one.Since they got very famous actors and actress, I really expect it to be fun. The trailer is interesting enough to catch me. I decided to watch it by not wait until the series end. I usually watch all episodes at once. But this series made me waiting for the new episode every week.I didn't expect such a good art work. The footages and montages are really wow for me. Creative team of this series have done a very good job. First few episodes really catch me with good editing. Farther episodes, I focused on the plots that getting more intense. The opening animation is very nice. I just love it. I also like some songs in this series.The characters of Mun Sungtae, Mun Kangtae, and Ko Munyoung are very interesting and new for me. I like the story behide their characters. I really pride Mun Sangtae acting skills. He killed it!The plot is very interesting for me. I want to know more and more about their story. I like many Ko Munyoung 's books. All drawing in Ko Munyoung books is nice and have characters. I want to follow the artist of that drawing. The story she wrote have hidden meaning and moral that really touched me.This series is quite drama but they also have funny parts and romantic parts. The funny parts are real fun. That is my vibes. They also got very nice costumes for all characters. The costumes support the characters really well. Ko Munyoung make up is very suit her. It was so great.For someone who haven't watched it yet, I highly recommend this series if you usually like Korean series.",10
"Ko Moon Young is one of the powerful female lead i've ever seen! Although, she is psycho, but that's okay , she showed us the well character development through each episodes which have a children's book fairytales. Beside Ko Moon Young, i really appreciate that each episodes always have taught me something good in life. Well, Moon Gang Tae's character is well paired with Ko Moon Young, their chemistry is really really good! Meanwhile, Moon Sang Tae is the character that i cared the most. Well, this is a good drama. But, sorry, i can not give 10/10 because of the ending, i do think the whole story ends at episode 15. When i watch episode 16, I don't have the things to be curious on because all of the things have been cleared on episode 15.",9
"I think that the actings are soo amazing.
It was really emotional in some parts and I really like it overall
Highly recommended",10
"Two mentally ill people - a man who thinks of everyone but himself and a woman who thinks of no-one but herself - teach each other to function as normal human beings. It's a moving love story.Such an interesting premise, which the actors make entirely believable. However, the acting honours go to Oh Jeong-Se, playing an autistic brother, who stole every scene in which he appeared.This series is well worth watching and highly recommended. It is almost as good as Mr Sunshine and Crash Landing on You, which are also from Korea and are the two best TV series I have seen in years.",9
"I really love Korean dramas. But this has to be one of the best! The main characters are just great. You almost fall in love with them. The story is very well written, and it conveys a clear message! You have to watch this 1000% for sure.",9
"It was aesthetically pleasing and well acted. But Oh my god OVER-DRAMATISATION of literally EVERYTHING. Couldn't related to anything or anyone, nothing was believable (except the portrayal of autism). Couldn't even finish",5
Loved the engaging story and the chemistry between main leads. The performance of both the leads was outstanding.,10
"Omg!!! What a masterpiece, just beautiful. Fun, emotional, heartfelt, self-finding, never underestimate the power of LOVE and the meaning of true HAPPINESS. NOW PLEASE STOP READING AND START WATCHING.",10
"I ended up binge watching this in one weekend. The chemistry between Seo YeJi and Kim Soo Hyun seemed so natural and you hope they find love with each other. Their lives along was Oh Jeong Se was intertwined with terror, heartbreak and loss of a childhood. Superb acting along with beautiful scenery kept the viewer entertained throughout the series. Will definitely be watching it a few times.
Hope there is a part 2!",10
"I've never written a review before, and I have watched so many titles that I haven't even finished rating them yet. But this series is so unique that I had to put it in writing just to help myself remember how it felt the first time I saw it.Everything about this series is enchanting. The story, the characters, the script, the set, their clothes, the music, everything. Not an episode passed by without crying my eyes out, some happy tears, some sad. I don't want to spoil it for anyone, so I will let you experience it on your own. Please clear up your mind when watching it and embrace the possibility that it's always okay not to be okay. Do not be embarrassed to show your feelings, take off your mask and feel everything at once or nothing at all.This series will forever hold a place in my heart and I promise to myself that every time I feel separated from the world I will re-watch it. Hopefully I will forget everything about it so I can watch it all over again. Enjoy!",10
"10/10 is my rating. This is a 2020 South Korean Romantic Drama television Series with 16, 70-85 minute episodes. Alternate title is ""Psycho but It's ok.""Moon Gang-tae (Kim Soo-hyun) and Moon Sang-tae (Oh Jung-se) are two brothers who have lived a difficult and unsettled life trying to outrun the horror of their past. Gang-tae is the younger brother but was told before his mother's untimely death that he should take care of his autistic older brother. who has autism. Sang-tae is the older brother but significant autism leads him to being child like, innocent and honest to a fault. As a younger child, Sang-tae witnessed his mother's murder which left him traumatized and, for some reason, terrified of butterflies. Gang-Tae is a care giver in psychiatric wards and has been able to move from hospital to hospital as they move around. at every place they settle in. Ko Moon-young (Seo Yea-ji), writes dark fairy tales which are inspired by horrific events in her past and an overbearing and abusive mother. She is invited to teach at the psychiatric ward because her books have special appeal for those struggling with their own psychological demons. Circumstances lead the three to the town where they all grew up and when their paths overlap Moon-young is drawn to the quiet compassionate and devastatingly handsome Gae-tae. Moon-young is extremely beautiful but unapproachable as some have indicated she has antisocial personality disorder. Those who irritate or seek to harm Moon-young are likely rto experience her wrath and her manager spends significant time and money cleaning up Moon-young's many social blunders. What Moon-young wants she usually gets and she begins to relentlessly pursue Gang-tae. The two seem like oil and water but are actually more like ying and yang. Can they solve the mysteries of the past and grow a love pure enough to heal both?I am really glad it is ok to not be ok because I certainly wasn't when this ended. I so loved the main characters that letting it go was like leaving old friends. It was such a wonderful and masterful story that was a little like ""The Adam's Family"", ""Rainman"", dark fairy tales, and A Series of Unfortunate Events"" mixed together and birthed something with elements from all yet uniquely its own. The backdrop of the mental hospital was fascinating because there were patients struggling with a wide range of mental health challenges. The honesty, compassion and courage the disorders were presented with spoke strongly to the message that we do not always have to be okay. The two brothers and the way they had their weaknesses yet leaned on each other through a rough and lonely childhood as orphans was very heart warming. Moon-young proved to be a lot less heartless than her exterior portrayed and was the missing key for the duo to become a trio and develop into a true family. The acting was amazing and the music, costume and sets were beautiful. I will watch this again and highly recommend this wonderful series. I would not change a single thing.",10
"After watching this web show i am so amazed how can k drama made this fantastic shows .

Believe me..... Just watch it... I don't want to spoile anything regarding this kdrama.It's so awsome so awsome that no other Serie or kdrama can replace it's story... And I also loved the whole cast of this series specially the lead heroine ? .It's one in a life time experience... Story Of a creepy world of different people turning into a real Measmarising fairy tail.,10
"This series is great...all which may be story line, background music,screenplay all are fantastic..though I watched in hindi dubbed...all characters are very unique and so sophisticated and well experienced. I also like the character of director of ok hospital....lead actress and actor are very charismatic personality..fall in love with them.",10
"I like this series really, well in first episode I find out that this series is very HYPE but after watching some episodes I found it one of the great series. I liked most Ko moon Yeon character, it's not irritating during the show apart I liked it most. I hope after you watched this series you liked this series very well. Also both brothers are acted well.",10
"Came for romance. Stayed for an amazing acting perfomance by Oh Jung Se, in his portrayal of Moon Sang-tae.",6
"Let me start by saying this is an excellent acted psychological drama/love story, with the main protagonists scarred by events or situations they have been in during their life. The main setting is a psychiatric hospital & I will not go into the main storyline details b/c that can be read in a synopsis.I wanted to give this drama an 8 or 9/10, but there is one RIDICULOUS plot twist that I cannot forgive so I've only given it a 6/10.*****SPOILER ALERT******Okay, let us talk about the mom of the daughter still being alive. It really goes off the rails on this ""twist"" in Episode 14. In Episode 13, the mom was shown explicitly being thrown off a 2nd story balcony by her husband & directly landing on the side of her head on the below stairwell. She suffered SEVERE hemorrhaging that would have killed her; but let's say for ""creative license"" sakes she survived this event. She would have had a SEVERE traumatic brain injury & would be eating through a straw the rest of her life! But there is more. Her husband then throws her body that's inside a bag into a cold lake. So basically, she's now dead X 2.But nope, she's been alive the last 20 yrs. & is now the head nurse at the psychiatric hospital! Say what?? It's explained that she looks nothing like her younger version b/c of plastic surgery; and by looking at the difference b/t the 2 mom actors, extensive/multiple plastic surgeries! I don't know how she found time to go to nursing school.If that isn't enough bad writing, it's shows the mom/head nurse helping a patient kill himself that occurs in Episode 1. But there are surveillance cameras in his room. A detective with more than 1 brain cell could look at the surveillance camera to show her helping him commit suicide! But that would have been the end of this drama after 1 episode.To me, this type of writing is an insult to the viewer. I understand in many dramas you must suspend belief to a point. But this ""suspension"" is Friday the 13th Jason type-suspension. And this is not a Friday the 13th type drama. Overall, it is a beautifully written drama showing how 2 scarred individuals fall in love while one grows a soul & the other finds life beyond helping others.My recommendation is to watch this drama but have your favorite hard liquor of choice available in Episode 14..........it might make the ridiculous plot twist go down better.",6
"I have been putting watching this drama off for quite some time, now i know why. I needed to learn that nothing will compare to it, and i am a big fan of CLOY and Vagabond. Strong plot, excellent acting performance, scripts, camera, soundrack..
What was interesting is that it made me watched it through the eyes of Moon Gang-tae, i felt what he felt, i laughed when he laughed and cried when he cried.Seo yea-ji was absolutely stunning, her makeup, hair, attire.. i couldnt take my eyes of her. Although her characters started off as a cold and emotionless woman, her warm smile gave her soon away. I was very impressed with how well her character developed throughout the series. I was also pleased to see that her character was equally strong as the male lead. This doesnt often happen even if put in a position of power.Kim Soo-hyun, what is left to say. He is a Mr. Actor. And who have thought that it will be Gang-tae who will have to let go, eh??And of course, lets dont forget to mention Oh Jung-se as the lovable autistic Moon Sang-tae. Amazingly well portrayed.The supporting roles were just as good, all very well complimented each other.For me the best kdrama of all times, a must watch that opens eyes about lives of carers and how they often sacrifice their own lives and happiness for those they care for.",10
"Acting was fabulous, particularly the brother with autism. He deserves an Oscar.",8
"9.5 ? Rating. This is my 1st Korean Drama. It's takes 2 Episodes to involve in Korean World.It's totally worth watching. Full of Emotions, Comedy, Romance. A perfect Definition of bond between two Brothers.Sang - Tae Steals the Show entirelyWatch 3rd Quarter In one goReview Count 1.",10
Very different story line but very moving and easy to binge watch with such amazing actors who were outstanding .... kind of like 'One flew over the cuckoo nest' Korean style ... highly recommend.,10
Every one should watch this rollercoster of romance really wonderful experience. Want to see 2 nd season.,10
"The story/plot of this drama, as you may already know by now, deals with mental health. Talk about taking risks, this production dared to be different and they delivered! Dark yet refreshing. The story and script was very interesting and provoking. The theme meant to not just entertain but educate and bring awareness on mental, emotional, and psychological issues people can relate to. True to its goal, the drama indeed is a healing drama.Impeccable acting by the 3 lead actors and by all the supporting cast. Everyone did justice to their characters, especially the 3 leads with their complex characters. Obviously, Seo Ye Ji and Oh Jung Se delivered their characters well (I did a little bit of acting in theater in the past and while their characters were challenging, it was much easier to internalize and deliver than that of Moon Gang Tae's). So hats off to Kim Soo Hyun... how could he have pulled off that character well is pure genius!The direction was neither fast nor too slow, just the perfect amount of suspense that viewers need to stay glued and captivated. The production was amazing too. They perfected all the details (costume, lighting, tone, angles and framing, special effects, dialogue, etcetera) and they were able to give the perfect scene setting and atmosphere needed in this type of unorthodox genre. Perfect execution!And as a special bonus, the soundtrack and musical score supported well the overall theme of this drama. Just made watching every scenes beautiful and touching!This is a deviation from the usual and the norm in kdramaland but watching the perfect blend of the technical and sentimental ingredients of this drama is already healing the soul. To say that this drama is a masterpiece is an understatement. I'm giving it 11 stars!",10
"Loved it , it will take you to a tour with amazing direction and acting.",10
"Overall it was a really good drama, showing us various types of mental illnesses. The part that didn't make sense to me was the arrival of the female lead's mother. How did she survive the fall from the stairs and being thrown into the sea inside a bag hours later?",8
"I'm not a K-drama fan, and it's certainly not a typical K-drama. The drama captured me from the very first episode, and I started to wonder the stories of each character. Each character is unique in their own way but realistic at the same time. It's really a healing drama, while the characters are trying to heal themselves by taking power from each other, I felt like their journey was also healing me with its warmth. Besides the great plot, acting is just outstanding. I fell in love with Seo Yea Ji's acting, so pure and natural. She reflects Ko Moon Young's character development so well and she shines through the whole drama like a queen. Kim Soo Hyun is amazing too, and his chemistry with Seo Yea Ji is just off the charts. I haven't watched such a good couple for a long time. Oh Jung Se's acting is awesome too. In addition to all, I loved the cinematography, so neat and elegant. And lastly, it gives really good messages with the its little stories and dialogues are quite well written. OST is great too! I strongly recommend.",10
"Acting of all cast is best & Story is mind-blowing & Peaceful. Especially acting of 3 main characters toch my heart respectively
1. Ko Munyong
2. Sang tee
3. Gang tee.",10
1 of the best series in lifetime. Total awesomeness...,7
This is bestes show of my life i never see this type of show but when i start watching this show i love it very very much i loved this show best show for all really i like it sooooo muchhh...,10
"Cinematography is amazing, acting, music, story everything is good about this show.",9
There's not many series that make a special place in Audiences heart. But this series one of those which made a special place in our hearts. This series has an amazing and an unique story line. I just love it.,10
"I've been exploring K-drama these last few months. This one is by -FAR- the best K-drama I've seen, and better than most of the series I've seen in general. Everything comes together: great cinematography, good music, great script and subtle acting by three amazing actors.Highlight for me was of course the developing relationship between Moon-Youn and Gang-Tae. I've seldom seen such tenderness on-screen, yet it never becomes tacky as there's plenty of humour there as well. Also the interaction between Moon-Youn and Sang-Tae was splendid, and often hilarious. The plot concerning Moon-Young's past/mother could have been better developed, but that's nitpicking.In short, If this series doesn't move you, you don't have a soul.",10
"Another interesting story about this girl, boy and his brother. Liked the story's in the drama and the moral of everyone one of them. They were wonderful and sad but at the same time very wonderful. I liked that type of drawing in the story even if it's for kids. How they were build and looked like.The girl in this drama, a famous writer who has two famous parents who's exist in a way but at the same time don't in another way. Her attitude was entertaining and interesting. I loved the way she took care of bad things, how she talked and was cold as ice even if that's not a very good thing to be. She didn't care about what other people thought about her or if they thought she did was wrong. She just didn't let anything stand in her way and did the things she decided to do.The boy in this drama don't have any parents, I don't remember about his and his brothers father but their mom got murdered. His brother was the only one who saw it but didn't remember their face. His sadness and loneliness hurt me, all he did was taking care of his brother without any parents. I felt bad for him most of the time but I just wanted to punch him sometimes too. When he looked back to when he was young it hurt me the most to see how he felt left out.Liked the actors and loved the bloopers at the end of the show! So cute to see how it looks like behind the scenes. Liked the layout of the story, that she had a moral in every book she wrote. Even if it was a tough way for them with problems and revealing truths it's a beautiful ending at the end and I'm very happy for them!????",9
This might be my favorite Korean drama I've seen. From the animation to the books to the relationships it's sincere and inspired. Really beautiful story and characters. I can't say enough good things about it. Don't miss this one! Everyone is perfect. Really well done all around.,10
"Outstanding series. This series had became my all time favourite. There is not a single department where this series lack of. From story to Cinematography, Animation to fairy tail, outstanding music and score. Spot on Acting by all the cast. Kudos to the director and writer and my favourite 'seo ye ji'.Must watch and also Hindi Dubbing is Outstanding.",10
This is mandatory for ur watchlist....the plot is awesome...liked it.,10
"Tldr; not for everyone, especially if you don't like unique and different. But if you like picking up that variety donut pack at the grocery store? This is for you, and a tissue box too!One reason why ""It's Okay to Not Be Okay"" is liked so much. It is literally a gem. The amount of elements it combines from horror, comedy, romance, and mystery; is just insane. Then the creators managed to have real children's books drive the story and still touch on sensitive mental issues.Trying to find a similar Kdrama is almost impossible, especially seeing this one delivered its' elements very well. You might get people calling it over rated just because it is not your stereotypical Kdrama. Which they would probably benefit watching something more vanilla.They also nailed their OST, atmosphere, and aesthetics. Really caught that depressing mood/vibe, while being uplifting when needed.The female lead (Seo Yea-Ji) played crazy love interest very well-to the point people are saying the male lead (Kim Soo-Hyun) didn't do good. I believe he did fine; it just that Seo out shined everyone. On top of that, she looked absolutely stunning in this Kdrama. If you look at her past roles; it is hard to believe it is the same actor.Easily one of my favs and probably is in a lot of people's top ten lists. Something to watch at least once, and then a 2nd time before you hit the hay.",10
Absolutely amazing!! You have to watch this series to understand the level of amazing story telling talent that Korea has. Hollywood and bollywood lack this talent.,10
The storyline is so engaging. You'll love the world created in this series. You are definitely gonnaove the whole cast. A must watch. Wish it never ended.,9
"Just woww... The series is so fine that you can't define that in words. It shows the bond between two brothers in the best way. All characters are written and executed very well. Particularly you will love the character of Sang-tae who is the elder brother of Gang-tae. In their childhood a bad incident happens, due to which the siblings has to change their places often. Sang-tae is mentally weak, but he knows how to deal with people and he is expert in that. Gang-tae loves his elder brother Sang-tae immensely and he always takes care of him. As the story moves ahead, Gang-tae meets Ko Moon Yeung, an author and he starts loving her. The story however has a mystery of butterfly, due to which these brothers have to change their places. Overall this series is a bundle of emotional scenes, thrills and small laughing boosters. You must give it a watch......??????",10
"Every part is adctive and writting screen was awesome. Its far different from other love stories and drama. One word for series ""ma$terpieace"".",9
I'm from India ???? I watched first time I like this.,10
Gang gae's brother sucks a lott...??If I would be there.....I would have killed him...how can he interrupt in his brother's life ??.....his friend also sucks.....,10
"One of the best Kdrama i ever Watch, i definitely suggest this mind blowing drama,,,in this drama everyone put their best and help it to Reach on the pick. Loved this drama, wish I'll see this kind of drama another time,,I'm eagerly waiting for this kind of drama ????????",10
"I just fell in love with the fairy stories in each episode. The cast is perfect ,full of strong emotions. I have laughed with the strong bold character of hero n heroine ..and i have cried with their emotional side as well. The childhood trauma of mine was a lot similar to the story.. may be i felt connected with the story, emotions and all tales eternally. Best series i ever watched.",10
"This movie is a masterpiece! First the title of the drama isnt it a comforting pharse!? This is not a typical kdramas. 16episodes with 16different retelling of fairytales that will change your perspective, try seeing things from other sides:-)
i love Moon gangtae and his character development from a suppressed and stressful boy to a caring and brave man who will protect his loved ones.Moon sangtae who shows us how patients with autism live their lives and how amazing they can be.And the most important one is Ko munyeong, an antisocial children's book writer who can see through everything despite her scary character from the outside, in fact she is just a girl who needs warmth and love:-)
screenwriter jo young really studied hard on patients with psychiatric disorders and did an amazing job here
i cannot finish any other kdrama after IOTNBO because this sets such a high standard for me:)",10
"At first the story seems a bit slow but there is no lack of energetic feeling in the story. As the story progresses, it will become more intense. The director knows very well how to attract the attention of the audience with a Ingenuous story. I enjoyed the whole time. All in all, the time was good. Everyone must see.",8
"After I watch this drama drama I started to watch it again and again. This drama made me laugh, cry, and also know about psychology.",10
"Well this was my first K drama that i watched i must say i was very impressed. From writing to direction, everything is perfect. Acting was at par especially by the guy who played Sang tae. I want to admit this that I'm in love with Seo yea ji after watching this show. This show is unique in terms of story telling. Mental health problem which i got to know is a major issue in South Korea was explained very well. Every character played their part very well which makes the show flawless until you reach the climaxI would have given it 10 rating easily because of the acting, cinematography, direction but climax was so horrible that i had to bring down the rating to 8. It appeared to me that climax was written by Ekta Kapoor where Mihir was resurrected after 20 years with a plastic surgery. Antagonist of this show, the mother, her character was never explained properly. Till the end i was clueless about the character of the mother. Why she was portrayed as a monster, how she escaped death, what did she want at the end? So many questions, nothing explained.Alternative ending according to me - As we know that the daughter had traumatic childhood because of her parents, director could have shown that she has overcome our trauma because of Gang tae and Sang tae's love and they have started a new family. No need to resurrect the mother. The show could have ended in 15th episode.",8
"Although I could see the director trying to implant romance between main characters, the more I watched the more depressed I felt.Both of the main characters bear too much and left nothing to give. As a outside audience, I feel like I'm watching two drowning ppl, out of nature they're attached to each other but pulling to sink together. What kind of distorted and suffocative relationship is that. Yes the story is attractive but the same time made me feel really uncomfortable, I hope the main characters wont get together in the end(still at ep.7.",9
OMG!!!Just completed the series and already fall in love with mun yeong.A beautiful face attact you alot but to fall in love its the vibes that should match with yours.They way she potrayed her emotions.. I have never seen it before.Lots of love to all the stars.. Its a family watch.,10
"This is the first time i liked non-lead role very very much. I liked his acting very much (Jae-su). I am giving 10 out of 10 stars for him. Fabulous, Extra-ordinary.",10
I healed the most after watching this drama. Very recommended!!!!,10
"Beautiful Drama must Watch
Actors Did their acting Perfectly
One of the Best couple On Screen.",9
The plot keeps you intrigued right from the beginning to the end. The characters are very well written and equally well performed.The music is the soul of the drama... Beautiful.. aesthetically pleasing... Locations used throughout lifts the mood! Kudos to the costume designer!Story is well written.. direction is amazing with the we'll use of comics and the graphics in between.The connection between past and present is very smooth.Most importantly the concept and the way importance given to mental health is encouraging in many ways.The climax was little disappointing in my opinion. It could have been lot better.Overall the best drama !!!,10
Great story & awesome acting. The Koreans are on fire!! The story is about 2 brothers and a woman who are on a journey of self discovery. Special mention to Oh-Jung Se for his unbelievable acting as a person suffering from autism.,10
A fantastic serie with amazing performances . The chemistry between the three lead characthers is fantastic. Oh Jeong-Se is spectacular as Moon Sang-tae.,10
Omg ! A Must watch! First episode is Fantastic! Do not miss it. Absolute Gore fun. Delivers what it promises!! Man I don't usually comment but this is Epic!,9
"Compelling, iam have way thru didn't got boring once so far. Nice designs, graphics and characters. Worth the watch for sure.",8
I started it thinking it to be some intemse thriller with plot twists. But this is Pretentious garbage with no real thrill and not even single interesting twist. Waste of time.,1
"If you have seen hostel ....then this series is just 100000000 times BETTER!!!!Unbelievable , thrill that gives you chill and makes you shrill !!!!The scenes are prolific that it stems SHOCK & AWE !MUST WATCH.",9
"Dub was good. Awesome show, give it a watch it was a lot of fun.",9
The trailer is much much much more exciting than the actual series. The episodes are not as thrilling as promised and is filled with unnecessary conversations.. this is a waste of time. It does have good graphics though..,4
"When I first saw the trailer, I knew I would watch this show in one day. It is a nice thriller drama that kept me hook throughout. The games that were played and the relationships between the characters is what got me into this show even more. Ending was somewhat predictable, but it was still a good show to watch. I do recommend for you to watch it.",9
"Just watched whole 9 episodes and my favorite was the 6th, Gganbu. Not perfect nor a masterpiece, but this is very well made and provides a certain level of emotional experience. The overall show was far beyond things that were shown in trailer. Very well directed, performed, and finding its own unique points from the genre mixture of various references such as Gambling Apocalypse : Kaiji, Battle Royale, and so on. Just hope all others enjoy this show not only in Korea but also everywhere!Ps. Even to Korean ears, VIPs' English conversations were not well written nor performed. I think the drama could stand well enough without their presence and save the budget.",9
"Squid Game is a brilliant metaphor for several things, but especially capitalism. 456 broken and bankrupt rats are set on a deadly race for a vast prize in an absurd and cartoonish version of hell. And who would willingly leave hell if there was even a chance, however outlandish, that staying might suddenly make them a billionaire? Very little of this series otherwise makes sense, and it makes an absolute meal of it.There are similarities to shows like Battle Royale or Alice in Borderland, but Squid Game does a much better job of making characters believable and likeable. Even passing characters feel like actual people, so you care for the thirty seconds or so that you get to know them before they pass.The design of the show is brilliant, the performances are all excellent. The danger feels real and the jokes are genuinely funny. I'm only on episode 2, but I love this show already. Personally, I like it better than Alice in Borderland.EDIT: Just very quickly, a lot of reviews on here are mentioning the cringeworthy acting and dialogue of the VIPs. I agree, but I think there must be a reason for this. It seems unlikely that the same people who cast, wrote and directed all the other terrific performances suddenly lost the ability to cast, write for and direct non-Koreans. It seems more likely their relative cartoonishness had a specific meaning and purpose... even if we haven't figured out what it is, yet.",8
"It has great suspenful moment and with decent to good character development. Due to this, a lot of the character death are painful to watch. It's definitely reccomended for those who love thriller. Plotwise, I would say it's decent enough to keep u watching and drive the story forward.",9
"This reminds me of a lot of things; a mix of As gods will, Alice in borderland, Battle Royale, Kaiji etc. If you enjoyed those then you would like this series as well. Squid game is fascinating and keeps me on edge/ wanting more after each ep with how the games are set out it showcases a variety of Korean-style childhood games that I've never seen before. At the same time it can be a Melodrama that manages to provoke you emotionally and although it may be predictable at times it's definitely a enjoyable experience to watch. Not to mention players are interesting, with complex backstories and personalities. From a poor/ in-debt background they all strive with the same motive of money but at what cost? It's amusing to watch how everything unfolds but at the same time making you question a lot of things. I'm quite positive with how it left off that there might be a season 2 since there are a few things yet to be answered and revealed if so I wouldn't be surprised. Hats off to all the the people working on this project and the wonderful actors. Definitely felt like a roller coaster ride. Personally thought it was exciting, intense and satisfying watch for those who like this type of genres.",10
This is only my second review. I binged this all in one day and loved it. I still like Alice in Borderland better but was a great show. Can't wait for a new season and to see what happens next.,8
"This show is really good and exciting. The cast is doing a really good job and I cared for the characters. The sets and camerawork were also beautiful there was not much action but when there was it was well shot. And finally, the story was solid there was only one plotline that wasn't properly ended but aside from that it was really good.",9
"5th episode is in, so far I haven't seen a higher level of violence and gore that I was expecting to see. It's a survival game genre TV show, but it hasn't been living up to its premise yet. Also, the show has a lot of side stories, so if one was expecting to see a simple kill and run show, then they will probably find this show boring. Lastly, the show is full of korean cultural references which can also be a boring factor for many viewers. It's simply because people can't understand what's going on and have more questions rather than enjoying the thrills of the ride. Overall, the show is entertaining and enjoyable. It still drew me to the 5th episode straight. But again It would have been nicer if it had more actions unless the show was originally intended as a social commentary. One more thing, it was really nice to see an indian actor as one of the main characters in the show. I know It's not a lot, but still it adds a lot of positive effects in the show.",7
2 episodes in and already hooked. It has basic concept that we have seen in other movies but Koreans know how to write unlike western writers. Characters get flushed out and you actually care about them. Acting is also really good (non of that cringy western actors). If you like well written thrillers definitely check this one out.,8
"Was released today and I was hooked by the first 20 minutes. I finished it all the same day , if there was more seasons I would've been watching the next episodes as I'm typing this up right now. Very good series that will have you at the edge of your seat with many twists and turns. Once you think you know what's coming next , it hits you with a curveball. Highly recommended .You can watch this in one day easily as I did & it was just released a couple hours ago haha .",10
"Truly a well-directed, well-acted, well-produced and casted series. I dare say I wish it could continue, but all games must end to have a victor!Thank you for this very bingeworthy story. Thank you all cast and crew involved. Despite not knowing more than 3 words in Korean I recognized several actors. Goes to show, Hollywood ain't everything!*To those that find this 'boring', please understand you need Michael Bay or shiny keys to keep your attention. *snap* Hello?! Are you listening?!*",9
Was expecting a typical graphic Korean movie... Turned out the movie was engaging with a nice twist to the ending. Highly recommended!,10
"A true survival series and extremely suspenseful. Enjoy it, well worth it!!!",9
Another game style type of movie from Korea.Great acting. Storyline good.The only reason I give it a 9 is because of it gets too many 10s one crazy rich guy out there might find it inspirational to start this type of game in real life.,9
"Perfect acting ??.. interesting series, with unexpected events.",8
"Great series! Story, characters, setting, and mood was nice. Except for the actors who played the VIPs. That was terrible acting and it could have been better casted and directed. But all in all, season 1 was great!",9
"Excellent showcase of human mind and emotions. Its the battle of strong people against the weak people covering all aspects such as morality ,honesty,sacrifice,smartness,cunningness and so on.This series is definitely worth your time and will hook you up to watch the season at a single stretch.",9
Yes very unique content most powerful never miss. Most enjoyable.,9
"Acting 10/10
Story 10/10.I higly recommend this series.",10
I loved the way the entire drama revolves around the true nature of humans. At every stage this drama never stops to surprise you. Tons of plot twists that add depth to characters and the plot itself. This is one of a kind show (genre & quality wise). You wont find anything like this anywhere. It is absolutely well written.I want to remove my memories and watch this again.,10
"My God the actors who potrayed the VIP people cannot act. I cringed everytime they said a line. It felt like they were just reading them. Even the intonation was off. It was like when we were kids and had to read a play in class and we exagerated the intonation. Terrible, just awful.",7
"I dont know how it happend, but a couple of days ago i was memorising my childhood (thats not happening a lot). And then i had a strong memory about this childhood game we used to play as kids in the neighborhood. And guess what? That game was the 1st game those players in this tv show played (i dont remember its name in a foreign language), the one they needed to freeze after the count stop... So i was realy amazed by finding this great tv show. Its seriously shown how our mind worked as kids and how we been more active as kids- as shown Through all the games in this amazing tv show. So yes its a big 10/10 for me.Recommended to any human being on this earth.",10
I like it so so much ... It was the first to end in first day ... But i think there will be season 2 bcs its not completed ... I hope its near bcs i can't wait.,10
"Really good show, until the VIPs show up in episode 7. Worst acting I've ever seen. It's like the director doesn't understand English himself and hired random American guys off the street. It doesn't ruin the show, but it's so bad. In general though this is definitely worth a watch.",9
"I am at the 3rd episode in a row! This is really entertaining in a good manner of modern Korean mystery dramas. Well done, usually I am quite skeptical about Netflix shows but this one is truly good one. Enjoy!",9
DefinitelyThe director is a fan of Playstation.>.<,8
"Plot, visuals, acts, scale... every elements were so well prepared and harmonized. The characters have distinct personalities and are very interesting.According to the characteristics of each stage of the survival game, the appearances of the characters collide and gather whenever they encounter in extreme situations. All those factors fit each other amazingly well. Each character also represents an aspect of society issue or shape of human beings.This movie is not only giving you entertainment, but also throw questions about matter of humanity, morals, strategy, social issues, family and the weight of life & death.There is no scene to skip.",10
"Honestly, i skipped the story of the player's background. But when the game began to play with all the gripping game stage, its excited me. This serial is a mix between the Hunger Games and Saw. You'll never expect whose the boss of all deadly games, if you already watched Saw movies, then you'll know.",8
It is a nice thriller drama that kept me hook throughout.I love battle royal concept and this is one of the best in this concept.Acting was so good and cameos were amazing.I recommended for you to watch it.,9
This show?! I have no words?! Really good 10/10!! I am amazed.,10
"Korean TV shows are traditionally a step below their movies, which have been the best in the world for a while now. With its budget, production quality and talent Squid Game could have been the one show that got away but all is sadly ruined by Lee Jung-jae overacting pretty much every scene he's in, he just doesn't seem to be able to ground his character. Granted, some of the writing is over the top too, which doesn't help but the director should have helped him calibrate. In comparison Gong Yoo and especially Lee Byung-hun own the screen and ooze charisma every single time despite very brief appearances.It's still a good show and overall quite watchable but it's just not great.",6
Everthing is amazing i really like it so much i hope there is season 2.,7
So boring. Try to be cool but no brain to do.Boring plot. Boring writer.Too drama. No fun. Nothing interesting.All can be is some series that just play and do something else.,3
I started it and thinking this is going to be a B-tvseries but it's AMAZING! When I think I know what's going to happen they throw a curveball.What an amazing tvserie.,9
"If you're not used to this Survival Game genre, you might find it exciting. As a long fan of this genre, I can make sure that this series is undoubtedly one of the worst among all. The problems lie severely in 2 key points that make a good Survival Game Film: The games and The story-telling. While the games, without exaggeration, are horribly boring, forcing, and lack the creativity to the point I don't even know if they actually spend time thinking about the game or they just pick it up randomly on the internet. The storytelling method badly worsens it with so many unnecessary scenes and lines. Towards the end of the series, I have to watch it with 1.5x speed, and still, it is irritatingly slow. That is not the worst yet. The SUPER CRINGE appearance of the VIPs just to show labor class discrimination is unacceptable and horrifically unnatural. They try to put on life-lesson so bad that the lesson turns out to be pathetically ridiculous.Tl,dr: this movie is cringed, poorly told, wayy overrated, and definitely one of the worst in this genre.",1
"Wow! This should an award series of 2021 in Netflix. The story does contain both funny and horror at the same time. In fact, those actors were all perfect for those roles and it really draws your attention to chase the episode like crazy!Even in these covid times, this film creator and director does know how to pull audiences with a mix of keeping the tradition but develop modern series!Thank you so much for this wonderful series!",10
This is definitely the most diverse drama I've watched it really is like no other drama I binged it in two days it kept me hooked first episode hopefully there is a second season because whilst the concept was gruesome and inhumane I really enjoyed watching it.,10
I really enjoyed this tv show. It was a little slow sometimes but it was still good. I really hope for a season 2.,8
"The film making, characters, acting and premise was absolutely brilliant.I did find myself rolling my eyes more times than I'd hoped as characters made completely illogical decisions (I'm looking at you Ali) which conveniently fit the plot. I feel like it was cheap story telling that the writers thought the viewer wouldn't notice.The voice actors for the VIP's were horrific but hey it is a Korean series.Overall I'd give a 7.8.",7
I feel like I hace seen this before a lot of times. It just feels like hunger games feel wise(Just the context not the spesific things) But in general executed above avarage.,7
"Squid Game. Wow.Korean.Best description? Uncomfortably genius!(Kind of disturbing - small warning but still)I mean there are some elements of The Game and Hunger Games, but this is bigger, more catastrophic in a different way, more clever, plays on psychological aspects, with a touch of closeness between some participants. Its intensely catchy and totally insane.Its set in a today's society with participants being people in economic trouble who owes a lot of money, mostly from gambling, and about their desperation. Great actors too!!They even include a very dark business of todays world - but I wont reveal anything here.Although its brutal - its more brutal in what's actually going on, and what's happening - than being graphically brutal.And you will sit there and feel lots of things - scared and somewhat freaked out as well, and as I said: its Uncomfortably geniusly made in my opinion.If you're looking for something different that will get your HR rising, try this one! *Handclaps*",9
"This drama is probably one of the most compelling battle royale content out there. The last episode was a bit boring as it tried to set up a bridge towards season 2, but overall the dram has a really interesting storyline.",9
"Even though there are many gameshows that require contestants to survive for one reason or another, Squid Game stands out thanks to its breathtaking visuals and superbly written characters. The former is done through colorful scenery that perfectly fits the ""kids games"" theme as well as the organized nature of a secretive organization's facility that houses so many people. As for the latter, EVERY character is struggling to make ends meet but how they put themselves in that position is extremely unique. The group is diverse with the main guy having to pay a debt he owes to land sharks, his friend having embezzled money from his business, an old man who is living out his remaining time with a brain tumor, a gangster who stole money from his boss, a woman who got scammed and more. Add to that the dark humor, an unraveling mystery surrounding the game show, and violence and you have the recipe for an addictively bingeable show.",9
"A series or movie that makes time pass quickly because you're so into it is greatly appreciated by me. So many titles to choose from but only a few leave you with a feeling of satisfaction after viewing. Several Korean series hit that mark, Vagabond, Kingdom, Tunnel, to name a few. The only problem I have is with scenes that go on way to long, Nine episodes could've been cut to six with some efficient editing but other than that I loved it.",8
Very well made series. They have done an exceptional job here with Netflix money. Definitely recommend.,10
"The show is great games in show is simple and easy for all people in the country religious to play but the show also has disadvantages that has a lot details that not make sense in show, also the plot twists are easy to predict. At this point Alice in Boderland is better.",8
Muat watch this series this is a gem well written and such a smooth script no boring scenes.,10
"We go through all the emotions in front of this series.One of the best show ever made, Netflix or otherwise.",9
"The show has themes and ideas that convey intense meaning. It gives joy and laughter, and every character is thought out to great detail. Keeps you on the edge and wanting more. You'll laugh, you'll cry and you'll feel for character's as if you were them. Absolutely wanting and looking foward to a season 2. Brilliant.",9
"Great acting, very interesting storyline. As someone who is fluent in Korean, I am watching the show without having to rely on the subtitles. As someone who is also fluent in English, I am reading the subtitles as well. I cannot believe that this high budget production is ruined by shockingly poor translation. For non-Korean speakers who must rely on the subtitles, please believe me when I tell you that the actual dialog is not that poor. It's shame that Netflix does not have any QC over translated subtitles.",6
"Pretty Entertaining.!!It's the first time I've seen Lee Jung-Jae in a series. I know this will be good. I've watched movies where he starred in and most of them are so good. If you liked Battle Royale, Saw, or any other Survival Movies/Series and enjoy plots that involve thinking, psychology and strategy , Do Not Miss this out.The Western actors though are so bad at acting.Warning : A scene contains flashing lights that may cause discomfort or trigger seizure for people sensitive to light.",8
Series is good we fans are waiting for the season 2 hope so it will be available in short time.,10
Squid Game takes a oft used trope and keeps it fresh and gripping.,9
My first review... you will not regret watching this as fans of both thrillers and korean dramas... this film really has outdone itself.,10
I never got to watch any series after Mind hunter and Kingdom that kept me hooked. The Squid Game hits off right from the Episode 1. The series deals with all the aspects of human emotions especially GREED! This show cant be missed at any cost. This series deserves 10/10.,10
"Absolutely brilliant! Loved it from start to finish, excellent acting (apart from the American actors at the end! Dreadful) Great story, had me hooked.. binged watched the lot!Looks like they'll be a second series which I can't wait to see! Superb.",10
"Was not expecting how deeply it makes you feel for all of the characters, there's a real connection you feel which makes you want them to win even more. Great plot with unexpected twists, would recommend this to everyone I know and anyone reading this.",10
I ended binge watching this show. Edge of the seat series. Very layered.you will not be disappointed. One of the very best. Hope there is a season 2.,9
"I have to say after watching the trailer, I immediately saved this series to my watch list and could not wait until it is out.However, maybe due to my high expectation I was quite disappointed after finishing the 1st season on one run. Believe me, I'm a sucker for this kind of genre so I'm looking for interesting plot, great games and unpredictable twists. If you're the same as me, the series will not deliver these. I found some parts are redundant with unnecessary overacting, I had to skip plenty times. The plot is quite boring for me compared to other survival-game series. But, I cannot deny the cinematography is great.If you have some time to kill, it still brings you some entertainment. Keep your expectation lower to enjoy it more if possible.",6
"This felt like yet another Korean remake of a popular Japanese TV show and/or movie (which itself was originally a manga) -- The movie in question is, ""As The Gods Will"" which came out in Japan back in 2014. Sure, they changed just enough so as to avoid any messy legal IP/copyright issues, but let's not pretend this movie is an original idea.I personally don't mind remakes, especially with foreign films being localized for a different audience (& culture). I just don't like it when try to pass off the remake as their original idea.As far as the show itself goes, it wasn't bad. I rather liked it, and liked the fact it was a TV show instead of a movie -- with a TV show you get more time to explore the world & characters. Acting was OK, cinematography was excellent and the writing wasn't bad either. I'd definitely recommend this movie to friends.",7
One of the best TV Shows I have ever seen. Simply genious and almost realistic. 6th episode is FABULOUS.I love this TV Show and one of the favourites from 2021.,10
"For someone who has seen Alice in Borderland and loved it, I see this series as a more mature and rawer version, without fantasies. Criticism of the capitalism of today's society, ironic how it turned out, becoming everything it criticized.Decent 8/10.",8
The details are in every scene. Wish to see another season.,10
"Good writing, good acting for most part (except the American actors), good messages, pacing is good.There really isn't much to complain about it once you're immersed into it besides the voices and acting of the American actors.",9
A large group of people who are down on their luck are invited to a game where all their money troubles can be solved. The only thing they don't know is that it will be a bloody battle for survival and they will each learn how far they will go just to survive. It is a little predictable in the overall concept but does have some surprises in leading up to the finale. Well acted and a reasonable pace over 9 episodes with a few plot twists keeps your attention.,8
"It's really an awesome show, episodes are 1 hour or more long however you won't feel that time coz series never gets bore or slow, once you will start it you will finish it in one go. Watch it, it's really worth of your time.",8
"This was one of the best kdramas i've watched on netflix! The storyline, the actors, the acting, it was wonderful. I've never rushed to finish a series before like i did with this one!",10
"I liked it but the last few episodes were too slow so I had to watch them at 1.5X speed. All in all, it is an odd and entertaining series nicely designed but not as unique as some claim. I do not know if the actors were poorly directed, if they are bad at acting or if it is a cultural thing but I thought many of the characters were overacting.If you have seen The Hostel franchise, Funhouse, The Maze Runner, Battle Royale, the Saw franchise, you will recognize a lot in this series. However, Squid Game stands out with its colorful design and imaginative theme and I liked it. Definitely worth a shot.",7
"You just name it and this web series got it all....love, sex, games, betrayal, humor, emotions, twists, drama and what not!This series is about a group of 456 players who get a chance to get off their economically miserable life by winning 46 billion wons and that is by winning in 6 games, a few of them being kids game. But its not so easy peasy as one thinks as each game has dire consequences and shrewd twists.All these long 9 episodes are super gripping and interesting. The games are quite thrilling to watch as players are forced to make some real shocking decisions and betrayals to win. What you notice is so many different shades of human being comes into play when money is the subject OR you could say, when money is the subject, there is little room to loyalty.I will agree Ep 6 is the best of all. Gganbu! This is the longest and by far the best i have seen. The game that they are given to play comes with a twist when players thought it to be otherwise and that part was quite fun to watch until....they are forced to make some shocking decisions to decide who should win. This episode tests the loyalty of people against the ones they love or have developed a good relation. It throws the audience into thinking....who should live and who should get eliminated! Not to forget, this , along with the last episode oozed emotions.But Episode 9 too is quite great as it comes in with a shocking twist! It puts forward the same question that generations after generation has been asked...""Can money buy you happiness?"". It also leaves some questions unanswered...what is the FRONT MAN's exact goal (FYI, this man too is a twist factor) and who is the mysterious handsome guy who gives Gi-hun that card?There's just so much in this series and everything is executed next to perfectly. The VIPs though are very bad in acting that is one negative. Overall, a must watch entertainer which can be binge watched in one go (or you may take two days considering it is a bit too long).",10
One of the best Korean series I have watched and loved every aspect of the show!. All the actors did exceptionally well. Eagerly waiting for another Season!,10
"So Initially I liked this.Than in the last couple of episodes everything was ruined.It sort of forgets what the main character wants to become.So the game has been running for decades. Yet it was sponsored by a man who died in the last episode???How does that work?I am sure some of the translations where not correct.The shaky English by the V. I. P. S sort of make that obvious. The V. I. P. S have to be the worst actors I have seen in a Korean show. I can't believe those people even have resumes and all experience as writers.... Can't they tell them to get other talent. Why did the majority of them have to be Westerners as well ???So after this was ruined. I looked back. And thought about what I liked.And I have to admit I was blinded by some of the decors and the art direction.There is too much that doesn't make sense , like the side operation run by some of the employeesSo the minimum I can give is 1 star when I rate a title.I gave it two stars because I liked the acting of the character Sae Byeok by Hoyeon Jung. As well as the other girl she paired up with in episode 5 and 6.I decided not to give a star for the art direction as their were some obvious fails to that as well. But I don't think the art department can be held responsible for that.They did have the best lines and writing as well.Really this is not worth your time as well.... just watch battle royale or tag.The shooting of this might have been a lot of fun. That is why it sort of is funny that the sick organisor says it is more fun if you participate instead of watching . Well I think this holds true for this show.",2
"This whole thing worked very well for me. With the exception maybe for the VIP scenes (how were they so bad?). Otherwise I loved all the character growth/progression or degression in some aspects. And I was very entertained the whole 9 episodes, which I watched over 2 days!",9
"The show hooks you right away on the first episode, but as the climax comes into play along with some supposedly plot twists being revealed, you realize how the show took the cheap and easy route.The characters don't make sense, especially Gi Eun and Sang Woo. Their character developments change drastically out of nowhere which makes no sense, especially towards the end.Since when was Gi Eun so heroic? Ok, let's say he cared about his daughter, and now that he has won the game, he is going to abandon her again? I really don't buy that his character is going to fight for justice, since he has been a weakling and won a lot of the games by luck. He is also a coward and has relied on others to win the game, so I don't get what he's thinking to go back. What is he going to do anyway? WHO TOLD HIM TO SIGN UP FOR THEM, NOT ONCE, BUT TWICE?Since when did Sang Woo feel remorseful? It's not within his character to stab himself. He didn't even feel bad when he let Ali die or when he killed Sae Byeok.The reveal of the player 1 was really a cop out and is supposed to add shock factor, but it was so cheap and obvious. It has been done a million times already.We also don't get closure from the cop and his supposedly Front Man brother, which shows that they are heavily reliant on a second season.I had other nitpicks with the characters, but it was more obvious towards the end where the flaws lie.In retrospect, I think the show has a good way of hooking you in and keeping you on your toes since you want to see how the characters will get out, and the games were enjoyable to watch. The actors did a fine job, and I think it's within the culture to have exaggerated characters. The plot has a weird way of grabbing your attention and makes you want to binge, but it is a cheap thrill like Money Heist. Ultimately, the ending kind of ruined it for me, since it went against everything that was within its message and having the characters change 180 did not help. If it had ended similarly to Parasite, where Gi Eun is sent back to society, but he is still not happy because money doesn't buy happiness then it works out. But this ending? CHEAP.6.5.",7
"Other says Alice in Borderland has much intensity especially in episode 3 . But squidgame, it has a heart, loyalty . It's a mix of As God's Will, Triangle (2011) that ship scene.",9
"The main character is a foolish, clueless, impulsive, emotionally self-indulgent jerk.Other characters, flawed but fundamentally good people, die getting him back to the real world with that 45.6B won (~40M USD), but what does he do for the first year of having all that money? Does he help any of the loved ones left behind by those people who died getting him there with all that money?No, he leaves them all hanging, suffering for another year in the circumstances that were so bad it caused those good people who died saving him to go into and then back into that bloody Hell to try to save them.And then what does he do when he decides to go after the people behind the game? He calls them up and threatens them, making sure they know he's an enemy to be removed.He's a very unpleasant, impulsive and judgmental fool. Fortunately, although he's clearly the main character from start to finish, he doesn't dominate too much screen time, and there are plenty of other characters to enjoy watching .... although they pretty much all die.",8
"Wow, this show had me hooked from the first episode. I've never been able to watch dubbed shows before but this was an exception! Watched every episode last night... amazing story and actors. If this was a movie it probably would have seemed ""cheesy"" to many Americans. I'm so glad they made it a tv show with plenty of time to build the characters and get the story right!",9
"Netflix seems to be able to find these ""box set""versions of visual cocaine that make one unable to stop the 'next episode' button. This Korean paranoid vision of game show euthanasia does kinda feel like something I'd seen it before, Battle Royale, The Cube, Maze Runner and even The Prisioner spring to mind. However, if you can get past the slightly weird dialogue and the slightly uncomfortable attitude towards women then it's a beautiful looking and engaging series.",7
"This show keeps you glued to your seat from start to finish. It's done very well from every point of view, just the police actor shoul have been less younger.I hope for a second season.9/10 Bravo.",9
"Better cast, script and plot than Borderland!Only downside- edge of the seat and non stop binging effect.",10
Wife and I really enjoyed the series. The storyline and acting was great.The only thing I would fault it on is the foreigners in the show. The Korean actors were top notch and believable.... while the vips just seemed like they found random foreigners in Seoul to play the characters. Even Abi seemed a bit strange at times.,8
RECOMMENDED. Finished this in one night. I cant stop watching it. Worth every episodes.,9
"Honestly the best tv show i've ever watched. Recommend it definitely 100%. Everyone should watch it, I finished the whole season in a day and a half.",10
"This has budget, making for some entertaining scenes, but the plot is quite poor, many parts didn't make sense, too much of it down to luck and it's very predictable. The characters' back stories are uninteresting, there's not much character development. It's average at best for the genre.",6
"I know that as one ages one turns into a grumpy old flatulating individual passing plenty of not just faeces but righteous judgement on a collapsing morally bankrupt world. All said, this 'review' comes from a person who saw Lord of The Flies when about 14 after our superb English teacher felt it worth seeing after we read the book as part of our education. I found both the book and movie so traumatic they changed my life. But probably in a good way. The point being made that below a certain age or level of training, young people are not suited to positions of power or leadership. More recently, productions and video games based on the Battle Royale principle also alert us as to the ethics of exploiting vulnerable young people for the schadenfreude entertainment of adults and a baying public. Sadly, The Hunger Games put production spectacle and creepy puppeteers ahead of violence, so the point wasn't really made, but it has the benefit of warning a younger audience how some adults use them.*** SPOILER ALERT ***
I had never heard of Squid Game and happened to catch it on Netflix last night where I saw the first episode. What got me was now just how there was NO humor in it at all, common with today's productions, but the pure blood spurting realistic brutality of the scene where the giant 'little' girl guns down those who are caught moving.As per The Hunger Games, the aesthetics and production design is superb, but can someone explain to me WHY such content is produced in the first place? Is Squid Game entertainment or a warning? And why is it a 15, not an 18? Alien was never gratuitously violent (they were at war) yet an 18 or X when released in the 70s. I know, I saw it when 15 and was terrified!My rating is based on the ethics of SG being a 15, not the quality of the production,",1
"Meh. Overrated. It keeps banging the same drum about what you'd do in a game if it was your life versus another's life. It's got a certain style, but the acting was amateurish and melodramatic. Sorta like anime.",4
An absolute thriller! The comedy gets you off guard even in the midst of a nail biting story! Enjoyed it.,9
An absolute gem from South Korea. Amazing show from the first ep. To the last one. A must see...,10
"Korean Hunger Games with better acting and much more relatable themes. The plot allegory focuses on the rampant exploitation of poor and desperate people, with the initial invitation to play the game and everything that follows appealing to their need to clear debts. This soon becomes about something much bigger and darker. Not for the squeamish.No spoilers, but I will say I'm a vehement anti-binger when it comes to my viewing habits. In the 10-odd hour runtime of this series, though, I stopped only to sleep and make a chicken wrap.",10
"Engaging from start to end. Exciting, shocking, yet with a fresh and unique storyline that's delightful to watch and visually pleasing. Actors play amazing performances. I could compare to hunger games, but probably 10 times better.",10
The show is still great though and can't wait for season 2.,8
"Although I don't usually like violent weird fictional series I would like to comment on this one, which I found to be quite good if you watch it as a metaphor of the financial game, the squid game is in my view the financial game and I would like to give some hints of why I think this. There may be some spoilers ahead, so don't read further if you don't want to know them.In the series we are introduced to some characters that have already played the game, or similar games like gambling (most of the new players are highly indebted) or are just very poor people that will be invited to play the big game, which comes with the much needed reward, the big money.The gameThe game is the financial game and we see the players being part of it trying to get the big price but dying in the way because of that. Nobody has been forced to play the game but nobody knows what the game is about, and as soon as they are in the game they can't leave it if is not by a majority deciding so. And this is the big question asked for the game designers when participants are showed that the game will play with their jobs, their families subsistence and, in sum, with their lives.""Knowing this, do you accept the game or do you refuse it? ""Nicely, after the first deadly round the vote is tied, and the last voter, the player number one, which later on we will know is a game designer playing for fun, the only one on the game from the elite, the only one that deeply knows about the game and may by himself stop it, votes to stop the game giving to the poor folks the chance to live a decent live far from the deadly game. But the game never stops, so most of the players return to it when given a new chance to win or die.The island, the leader and the policemanThe game is corrupted, so it has to be played in an island, a tax haven, outside the law. This is a parallel plot ran by two brothers, one of them running the game, the leader, that would be the corrupt lawyer or the broker that we learn that already got his money share when he won a previous edition of the games, and a policeman, the law, that manages to get there looking for him as the leader is his brother, and that sadly is being killed by the corrupted brother being unable to expose the plot to the justice.The secondary playersBetween the players we find some of the social archetypes. There is the gangster, used to play by his own wild rules but without the skills and the knowledge to win in the big game, the immigrants, political and non political, playing with their disadvantages and being cheated and murdered, people with family traumas for whom the game means nothing now, the broker who already played the game in the real life before and failed, and who knows that the game has to been played dirty if you want to win, but even like this, you may always loose, ...The old man and the main characterFinally, between the players, there are two of them especially interesting, the first one and the last one. The first one is, as we find out at the end, a game designer that is so implied in it that cannot be like the other VIPs, gambling and watching from the outside, but has to play. His reward is not the money but the act of playing itself. The last one is all of us, is the TV watcher watching all of them, watching the game and being fascinated for it but at the same time refusing it, not willing to fall in its trap, not wanting to be mean, trying not to play dirty but at the same time doing nothing in front of the horror. This is why the old man takes an interest on him and there is a wonderful scene in the game of marbles where he sets up a situation inviting to the honest player to cheat, and he, the honest hero, cheats to save his life knowing that the old man will be unfairly killed for this. And then is when the old man gives him his last marble as reward, because the old man has now win his own game, he has finally won his own reward that isn't the money but knowing that everybody has a price and that everybody would have done what he possibly has done to become who he is. He can get rid of his guilt and he can leave the game as the real winner. However, when the hero wins the final game and may be proclaimed as winner, he refuses to win, he tries unsuccessfully to leave the game giving up the reward, and goes like this after that, being impossible for him to do anything with a money that becomes dirty as it has been earned cheating a poor old man who was killed because of it. He and the old man are on a similar situation now, both are rich thanks to the misery of others, and both feel guilty about it. So, in a desperately bid to get rid of his own culpability, of his own failure, the old man reveals him who he is, which is for some time effective, because our hero learns that nobody died because of him cheating and that he was the one cheated by the old man, so he may feel innocent again and enjoy the reward, until this falls again in front of the truth, revealed now by the recruiting scene of new potential gamers in the metro. Nobody who knows and has played the game may be innocent anymore.",8
"I found the show to be fantastic, only ruined by the horrible VIP acting.",9
"This movie offers nothing new within this genre of movie but it does deliver its story in a solid, pleasant way, wrapped in very well designed and visually appealing sets.The only major problem I have with it is the acting.It's not that the acting is bad (except for a few exceptions) but more so that characters are acted out in a comic- or anime-style way, which is what the director wanted, I guess.Almost everything is over-the-top and at least for my taste cringe-worthy and comical instead of realistic. For example: you will often see 'fear of death' portrayed (acted) in a hilarious, comical way, which can (at least for some people) be extremely awkward, since the movie has an overall dark, serious and brutal tone. This contrast does not work well, at least for me.So, if you like extreme over-acting and enjoy seeing anime-style behavior in a real movie: go for it. Otherwise you may find if off-putting.",6
It was an ok watch to start with but then each episode just dragged and dragged on making it quite drawn out and boring. Should have made it into a 5/6 episode series. Doubt i'll watch another series if they make one.,5
"The best way to describe this show is the feel of black mirror and the politics of parasite. I loved every second of this show from the characters,plot to the games,although I loved this show but please don't make a season 2 make this a one time thing it ended great and I feel like a season 2 would just drag the premise. Don't fall into the trap of other shows where the first season was brilliant but the later seasons were downgraded in quality.",9
"This series really gave me goosebumps, thrill, and emotional attachment for the first 5-6 episodes (4th game), then the VIPs come and boom, what's going on?The worst part of this series is the VIPs. Idk why would they cast these foreigners. Their scripts and acting is soooo annoying, exaggerated, and their roles and existence?? So unnecessary. Every dialogs from their side are so cringy, and it hurts my ears. Their acting skills made want to skip the whole series or just fastforward it.Then the police. I was so excited whenever I see the police in actions. But the conclusion? Hus fate? Damn it was so disappointing, like all the struggles he went through means nothings. There was no clarity of his fate, and I can only assume that all the recordings and proof were not sent at all as the game still continue a year after and no further investigation were mentioned.5th game and 6th game, the VIPs came for the most exciting game of all. But what? Both were so boring and there was no thrill or emotional attachment like the previous 4 games.The conflict between gu han and sang woo. The hell? It was so rushed! Just after 1 game, and the relationship broke just like that and they decided to kill each other? And why suddenly sang woo decided to kill himself after the last 5th game he didnt feel remorse or guilt to the people he sacrificed???After gu han, who won all games by luck, he decided to did nothing with his money, even to the point he did not help Sae Byeok's lil bro, Sang Woo's mother, and especially reclaim his daughter until a year the game ended??? What was that all about?? And just when he finally decided to meet his daughter, he decided to get back to the game, in which he won all pure by luck? (Except for 2nd game)Plot twist was so predictable as well.Couldve given a much lower stars, but the korean actors did well with their acting, and the first half of the season was still satisfying.",5
Loved every episode. Give it a chance. Definitely not the same ol crud that gets pumped out over and over these days.,9
"Probably one of the most cliché, ""battle royale"" kind of storyline... BUT... It was still very gripping, intense, and entertaining. Definitely a binge worthy show! I can really see the typical K-drama elements in this show - you know, the unnecessary and far-fetched plot twist that almost makes you feel like it's trying to make up for something? Yeah, that. I could probably list all the cliché and predictable moments in this show but I don't want to spoil it for anyone.However, I can't deny the fact that this really did get me binge watching for 2 days. Perhaps, it's the great acting or the overly indulgent storyline - I'm not sure but I was hooked.",7
"Just binged the whole 9 episodes, best thing I've seen on Netflix since I opened my account. Even though it's dubbed, you hardly notice! Watch it, you won't be disappointed! ??????",10
"One of the best K Netflix series I've seen in recent years. The plot, cinematography, and acting (with the exception of some masked caucasians in the end) was superb. Several A-list actors were in this show and the cameos by them were very well woven into the story. Looking forward to a season 2.",10
"This is a gripping, bingeable series. Without a doubt. It is fast-paced and builds anticipation throughout.But once the mystery fades, we see a pretty shallow set-up. Promising character development ultimately does not hold up, with some making seemingly inexplicable (but plot advancing) decisions. Other supporting characters have absolutely no-depth at all to the point of being gratingly inhuman. Other reviewers compare it to anime/cartoon. I agree.In the end, there are enough open questions to support a second season but unfortunately not enough resolution in the first season to feel we really got the payoff we needed for putting up with all that violence.",5
"I use to binge watch shows a lot. Then I kind of went through a slump. This show reminds me what a good show is about. The main cast were generally very good at making me sympathize. I think I recognize the stormshadow actor from GI Joe. The rich elite VIP actors (as other have mentioned) I swear were told to be hammy. Thankfully their scene presence is short. Make no mistake, this show is somber, melancholic and not a rainbow /sunshine kind of show.Some questions about this world is revealed and so It sounds like there could be a season 2 but I really kind of wish they don't focus on the games again.",8
"I have finished to watch this Korean Drama, it is very good, will this renews Season 2?",8
"I really enjoyed the show as a whole, but it was so predictable that it became more and more annoying with every episode, 0 twists and suprises. I could tell how the ending is gonna look just after the first game. I Immediately knew that the old guy is involved and they didn't even try to hide it, same scenario about the leader of the game, i knew that they are related, about 5 seconds after the cop found the card in his room. But that really can be just me, so my ranking is not affected by that. Acting is on a pretty decent level, except the VIP-s , these guys were really bad, it felt like they got netflix employees to do the scenes because there was a shortage of english-speaking people to do it. Overall the show was really fun and entertaining. One of the best shows that netflix came out with lately.",7
"This show is the best versions of a genre which has been done before. It's just unbelievably aesthetic, gripping and full of suspense. Some episodes are funny and some are very heavy. The season ending is perfect and fulfilling.",10
"Wow, I cannot believe this show! Ending was a bit
????? But overall excellent great work Netflix.",10
"Right off the bat, I smelled something fishy when Player 1 was actually Player 1. There were plenty of plotholes such as:Gi-hun owed the loan sharks and he tells them he'll pay them in full ""next month"" but we learn that he hasn't touched his winnings from the account so how did he pay them off?Diagnosed with diabetes and nearing amputation, Gi-hun's mother is not even in the hospital upon his return but dead on the floor. How long has she been dead?The cop has played every move smartly up until sending the evidence to the police which ruins the whole angleThe cop's brother ""won"" the game but then becomes the Front Man and then kills his cop brother? Why?How did Gi-hun know exactly where to find the girl's little brother?All winners presumably are allowed to go free. What stops them from uncovering this game conspiracy? If any of the past winners accumulated together, they could bring down the corporationIn the first instance, Gi-hun could have asked the cop to insert a tracking device on Gi-hun so when he went to the game the second time, the police could track his locationThere was no rule against crawling in the 6th game when they're crossing the glass. Two people can stand on one tempered tile while one person is crawling ahead. If the glass ahead breaks, the person with them (behind them) can just pull the person who starts falling by their legs and hoist them back upTo my knowledge, tempered glass doesn't shatter. It webs up as we see on a car's windshield. Even so, a huge chunk of glass hits the girl and she bleeds profusely which doesn't seem plausible at allThere are presumably 456 players when the games are starting. They could have easily constructed a human pyramid to reach the money inside the chamber. A few of them could have blocked the doors to stop the guards from entering. Alternatively, the players could have also overpowered the guards by their sheer number alone.Why didn't the cop trigger the bombs when he was escaping?When the cop sneaks into the van as a player, the guards are scanning the players behind their ears. What exactly are they scanning for?",5
Seriously?8.3?The ending is absolutely illogical.,6
"Solid drama with good story complexity and excellent character build up. Each episode is thrilling and heartwarming. Awesome series, one of the best series i have seen so far on netflix. Looking forward for Season 2.",9
"It is one of the best shows that I have ever seen in my life. Interesting plot, great acting etc.",10
Great to watch this series. The story was gripping and the acting was exciting... except for the VIPs who came in the last couple of episode. They could have done better.At times I felt that dialogues were a bit too long but you have to complete the time slot. The lead actors were great in their roles.,8
One of the best kdramas ever. I will défini rewatch t many times.,10
The show was epic!!!! But I want to know who sing that cover of fly me to the moon!!! I know that's not Renee olstead!!! Who is it!???,10
"With a premise similar to the likes of Cube and Circle, the odd titled Squid Game helps us question humanity all over again as well as the importance society places on money.As dark and violent as Battle Royal and intriguing as 3% it grabs your attention early on and keeps you guessing to the end.Great binge worthy series with a likeable cast and main protagonist.Knocked off one point as I didn't love the ending but otherwise a really great TV series with some great ideas and worthy of top marks.Season 2? Personally I think it works better as a one off but then again...",9
I'm so boreddddd. I'm on ep 3 or 4 and there's Only been one game what the heck? Lol. Hunger games was more riveting.,4
"Decent set deco .Battle royal flavors.A bit long in runtime, especially after first half.Very bloody and gory at times.Addictive if thats your cup of tv tea.",7
"Man! This show!Does everything right at the best times. Just when you forget some detail that would make you feel brilliantly smart, it comes back to whack you in the face!Like some of it's contemporaries it brilliantly fuses comedy and horror in the most psychological of way's and I must say, I really want more of this, and more like this.",9
TBH THIS IS THE BEST KDRAMA IV WATCHED IN 2021. THE IDEA IS DIFFERENT FROM USUAL KDRAMAS. IT SHOWED US THAT THERE ARE MANY GREEDY PEOPLE THAT WOULD KILL AND BETRAY YOU FOR MONEY AND IT SHOWED HOW FRIENDS CAN SCARIFIES FOR EACH OTHER NO MATTER WHAT. I RLY LIKED IT AND I HOPE THERE IS SEASON 2 WHERE THE REVENGE FOR THE PEOPLE WHO DIED.,10
Even if you're not a fan of dubbed over movies this will catch your attention. The story is incredible and messed up in a beautiful way.,8
"I really didn't expect that much when I started to watch this serie. I finaly binged it and loved it. Got sticked in front of the screen. I really liked the scenario and the acting. A very surprising serie that I suggest you to watch. Be aware however, this is brutal visualy and emotionaly.",9
"I started it with no boogers but it turned out to be amazing show. If you like Alice in borderland, you will like this for sure.",10
Really enjoyed the series. Probably would have given it a 9...that ending though.,7
I'm Korean and felt sorry for the poor translation. The frontman and other masked people all spoke Korean in a strange way. I think the director deliberately created a bizarreness through the horrible acting of people involved in the game including VIPs.,8
"There are three types of human relationships that squid game characters have.Type 1. The relationship between Deoksu (101) and his gang to obey by power.Type 2. Human relationships (218 and 1), such as Sang-woo (218), Il-nam (1), that give others to benefit from human relationships (218 and 1) succeeded in society, are intelligent, and elite)
Type 3. Ki Hoon (456), Abdul Ali (199), sae byuk (67) and Ji Young (240) have pure trust (less social experience or unemployed)The best way to relate was to play the 4th game.A. saebyuk-Jiyoung, Deoksu-His subordinates were a team of the same type.Saebyuk and Jiyoung lived a difficult life as North Korean defectors and killers in society, but Jiyoung sacrifices for the saebyuk that opened her hand for the first time (Confrontation between Type 3)Deoksu and his subordinates usually work together, but they have no choice but to turn right away in extreme situations where they live only when they kill each other (Confrontation between Type 1)
Deoksu's betrayal by his subordinates before entering the squid game immediately shows how easy human relationships are to be betrayed in extreme situations.B. Abdul Ali-Sangwoo, Ilnam-Kihoon were a team of different types of people.In the confrontation between Abdul Ali (199) and Sangwoo (218), Abdul Ali trusts Sangwoo until the end, but Sangwoo betrays and wins (Type 2 wins against Type 3).Sang-woo (218) gives Ali Abdul a bus fare, but I think he has changed in the same way as Type 2 as he has experienced a loss if he acts like 199 while adapting to society.-Ilnam (1) and Kihoon (456) are people who have lived opposite lives even in their numbers.Il-nam (No. 1) meets and plays with people like Ki-hoon (No. 456), who already makes a lot of money and feels demonstrated in life as he grows old, and gives no return, and feels joy in pure human relationships.Ki-hoon (456) gives a favor to Il-nam (1) and impresses the writing so that Il-nam loses on purpose (Type 3 wins Type 2)Ilnam (1) is a successful person in life, and he has lived in Type 2 way, and he seemed to think that it was right.Social life, socially high command and a lot of income people who think we should act in ways such as type 1 or type 2.I think I've experienced that type of people win while playing squid for a long time.The scene that shows this appears in the scene where vip bet 101 or 218 times as a favorite.Ki Hoon (456) was a person who overturned all of the above thoughts.-VIP didn't pick Kihoon (456) as the favorite.In the final, when Ki-hoon (456) tried to give up the money without stabbing him, Sang-woo was moved by Ki-hoon and committed suicide by admitting that his beliefs lost to Ki-hoon.Ilnam(1) has lost his mindset while playing the game.He lost to the type of person he thought was stupid who had stepped on to get a high position throughout his life.The last time Ilnam called Ki-hoon to play the game in the last episode seems to have tried to discuss Ki-hoon's reversal of his thoughts for the last time.Kihoon (456) met Ilnam at the end and played a game, and asked Ilnam, ""I won now, right?""
While playing the squid game, Ki-hoon showed ilnam that his thoughts were wrong as a result, but Ki-hoon doesn't seem to know that he did.It was a series that allowed people to reconsider human relationships by showing that people like Ki Hoon, who give trust and favor in no return, beat others.",6
"Best Netflix show I've seen for awhile. Had echoes of Spanish film The Platform (2019) and of course The Hunger Games films.Hard on their luck people pushed down and controlled by the top feeders of society, are approached to play a game to win the big bucks and get out of the current holes they have found themselves in.And what a thrilling edge of your seat ride this makes for viewing. Unknown masked dictators are hosting a game-show of sorts were the players (In debt everyday people) are desperate to win the cash even if it costs them their lives.Lots of twists and some deeper observations on humanity follow. Just a warning it's very violent and a bit trippy, so if that's not your thang obvs avoid. It also reminded me of the human sport elements in Eli Roth's Hostel and James Wan's Saw franchise so yes it's out there.Will become a future cult classic and Korean cinema is having a golden moment after masterpieces like Parasite and The Handmaid. Squid Game's hyper realism is pretty visionary stuff for Netflix's typically bland output. Fly me to the moon 8/10.",8
"There is no deeper message here. It's just the same old tropes but packaged in very expensive production. It's the premise of Saw dialed up to a hundred, with the same shadowy cabal of puppet masters and wealthy elites making the poors kill each other for sport on widescreens that we've seen in endless iterations already in the last decade, like in Escape Room to name but one example. The show likes to present itself as more cunning and introspective than it really is, when at its core it is just mean-spirited schadenfreude pantomiming as societal critique.It looks visually very impressive, but it is so hollow and cynical that after the first few episodes it just feels like you yourself are being tortured by having to endure the never-ending meat grinder of despair. The cop's storyline is also so contrived, and induces some of the biggest eyerolls in an environment that is already straining the suspension of disbelief far beyond its maximum elasticity.So I guess watch this if you want to feast your eyes on some majestic set pieces and also if you hate people.",2
"Everything works for me. The concept, the acting, the twist, the tone, the plot, everything.Superb.",10
This show is absolutely amazing! You should definitely watch it.,10
"First of all , lets appreciate the aesthetics and the colors of the movie.Now lets make it clear that this concept is not new , its very similar to ""Kaiji"" an anime series I really loved , I started to get flashbacks from ""kaiji"" specially when I saw the VIPs and the bridge scene . I don't mind the similarity because I really liked how the move started The first EP was perfect but after that it became a rip off of a great anime series like ""kaiji"" , The plot holes started from the police man when he sneaked under the car like how is that possible? , and then he passed all the security . How the hell there's no cameras everywhere , why they didn't put cameras in the bathroom and a lot of other small rooms, and the most ridiculous thing they didn't put cameras on the boss's room . A lot of minutes were wasted with that 'wanna be detective' police officer , I really hated him since I saw him and I was waiting for his death .",4
"Squid game is what I can only describe as an evolution of the Battle Royale genre, what I mean by that is that you have a premise of putting x people into a deathmatch situation where only the best or luckiest individuals can get out alive. This heavily reminds me of Gyakkyou Burai Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor (Anime) and another movie called As the gods will, but this series did something quite unique and unthinkable which deconstructs many tropes and cliches.Honestly this is very well made, You get to feel for everyone's struggles and motivations to the point where it becomes relatable.I highly recommend you to give it a watch!",10
"For me is the best Kdrama in Netflix. So refreshing, thrilled, gore at the same time. Is really mind blowing. 2 thumbs up for this drama!",10
"My god!! Where do i even start? The whole series was on another level. I don't know how they managed to make every single minute thrilling and entertaining. I was about to watch few episodes now and rest later then ended up watching the whole series on one day and oh boy the subs were horrible i can pretty much understand everything on korean so i watched few episodes without subs cuz of how bad the subs were. Other than that another masterpiece by koreans, loved it from start to end.",10
"First episode was great, then the story fell into emotional moments cliché, come on, at least not in second episode. What's going on? But gladly, the episode 3 was back to good, however my excitement didn't last. Since round 5 the game started to be boring, in fact the 4th game was already not so good, but round 5 was a new low, it is an unsuccessful copy from Kaji, the Japanese manga, and 16 players for 18 choices can be a dead end for the game, so they drag out a former glass worker to help them to finish the game, and at that point I found the show is overrated. And I was right, the final game is nothing but a boring friend-kill-each-other. After victory they made most of final episode to justify the season 2 and why protagonist want to join new game. OK, I got it, Netflix, season 2 is on the way.Btw, I realized 001 was too smart to be a loser at 4th round, just don't know he was the holder all the time. So, it isn't a big WTF moment to me.",6
Superbly made. This is something different that was made with thought and passion. If I don't recommend it to others then I don't actually what's actually one should. Bravo!,10
"The Squid game is probably one of the best shows I have seen in a long long time. It sure knows how to play around with the viewer's emotions. It will make you fall in love with some of the characters and then break your heart by killing them off in creative ways.Its a tough show to watch simply because you will be fully invested and immersed well enough into the story for it to make an impact on you.Great Character development - CheckPerfect Casting - CheckPerfect screenplay and progression - CheckA brilliant show that is a must watch, that will make you root for the characters, cry for them and generally start to question their morality, motivations and choices.And that's what the show is all about. The ethical choices we have to make just to be selfish, just to survive one more day in this cruel cruel world.I will not give away the plot but would instead implore you to watch the show by yourself and form your own opinions.",10
"The TV show has an excellent thrilling and engaging premise. Blood and violence are spilt all over the show. The plot becomes more and more interesting as the episodes go. If you are into ""bloody games"" show, you will certainly like it.",9
"Keeps you excited, interesting twists and turns throughout the series. And then, then one of the worst and ridiculous endings ever. Last episode destroyed somewhat decent series.",1
"While some scenes were hard to watch.. this movie is jaw dropping, start to finish. I almost always can't seem to get into foreign films but Squid Game had me by my lady balls! It's uncomfortable yet staggeringly exciting. I feel almost guilty for saying that but it's a twist that I have never seen done within a movie. Hunger game, maze runner, none of those can compare. I want MORE!!!!",10
"Hands down maybe the best show I have ever seen, can't stop thinking about it!",10
Good The thing is they are stretching It out. Story and all things are good but The concept if a new one in the web series world.,9
"I found it amazing through and through. Very emotional, I felt horrible during every episode but I kept watching and found the suspense amazing. Well done.",10
Woow. Am shocked! Amazing sereies. Defined beauty.,10
"The premise and aesthetic of the show had me hooked already. Lots of mystery. Love-able and hate-able characters. The ""games"" they play are always intense and you hope your favourites survive.It was quite emotional too, there's times where you have to be deceitful to your allies.Really great show all round. Although the VIP's had atrocious acting when they were introduced around EP 7. Really took me out the immersion for an episode.Other than that it was amazing, I love Korean shows and you don't get many on Netflix, so I hope the show does well so we see more.TL;DRIt's great, watch it.",8
"Excellent show with incredible attention to detail on the psychology of different characters and how the relationships between these characters develop during the game. Definitely worth the binge in one night! The show is incredible in terms of scriptwriting AND acting and has an exciting unpredictability to it. Additionally, the soundtrack was brilliantly consistent and the repetitiveness helped tie all the episodes together.The only element in this show which was slightly worse was the acting of the VIP's from episode 7 and onward. They weren't too bad, but their acting was noticeably worse than the Korean actors.",10
"This one kept me watching. Great characters. Interesting, if very dark story. I didn't find myself rooting for any single person. They were all flawed, damaged, even downright pathetic at times. Especially the ""protagonist"", which is a term I use very loosely here. He's not likeable. He leeches off of his mother, he takes money intended to buy a birthday present and dinner for his 10 year old daughter and gambles it away. Again, he wasn't likeable. But he was a well written character who at times I almost found myself sympathizing with, only for that sympathy to fade with another cowardly action.There is no objective good guy, with the closest one being the undercover cop, though even he acted questionably and reckless.Not every story needs a good guy though. I am fine with this. In fact, I applaud this series from breaking the ""hero of the story"" trope. Every single character seems to have a compelling reason for being where they are.In several ways, this series reminded me of Alice in Borderland, which I personally think was better written and one of my favourite series in this particular genre. Though this one was still a good series and well worth watching overall.Cue forward to the VIP scenes. As mentioned before, that could have been done much better. I don't know where they found these guys, but none of them were convincing. Their downright atrocious acting knocked down my rating by 2 stars.I can handle the occasional bad actor. I honestly don't mind when it's a single person in a role that isn't too important, but these VIPs filled the screen for far longer than their talent as actors should have permitted. Especially the old man with his 69 obsession. His lines were bad, his delivery, worse. Whoever he is, I hope that was the last time I saw him on a screen. He wouldn't have been out of place in Troll 2.I want to end this on a positive note. Honestly, the story was really good. The plot twist with player 1 is incredible and one I personally didn't expect, even if I had some suspicions. Towards the end, the main character has grown as a person and becomes someone I can almost respect. Which is quite an accomplishment on its own.But he should have gotten on the plane.",6
I binge-watched this one. Every episode was so addictive and tense.All episodes were very emotionnal. Then we reached the conclusion and.... what a letdown. Huge anti-climatic ending.I would still recommend watching it.,8
"The show's moral is ""the poor and rich are similar"". The poor being the good guys and the rich being the bad guys. As reasonable as the trope is, this one is executed terribly. Let's call is this a ""Game of Thrones"" ending: I was enthralled until the 7th episode and then it was garbage.",1
The series was really interesting and entertaining till the last half an hour of the last episode. The ending is rubbish.,1
"Wow he seemed clueless. And selfish before the game, then somewhat unselfish during, unless it suited him. But it would have been nice to have a smarter lead character.",8
"The VIP's were, as many said before, horrible actors.",9
"First it looked very exciting and fresh content for netflix shows, the first game was amazing but then the following games were quite boring except game 4. The stories about characters were SO BORING, i could not watch most of the storylines about them. The lines were too long and boring and unrelated as well. Police thing was very exciting but then what? He killed by his brother who is the manager of the games(!) and nothing clarified?? Who is he? Why is he the manager of the games? As a watcher, it did not give me the answers so it was a wasted storyline too. And i do not even wanna talk about VIPs and their lines...they were horrible. And the ending, why did you go back? What about your beloved daughter?what about your promises?Besides all of these bad comments, it was a unique show and some scenes were very exciting than i could not even blink. So if you wanna have some disturbingly beautiful and at the same time some boringness you can watch it :)",6
Would give it 10 if it ended with an ending.Please don't ruin this with a second season.,8
"WOW, there are so much twists, action, suspense, drama, and messages all packed in 9 episodes. It is hard to stop watching once you started. One of the best Netflix show ever. I really like the ending.",10
I just came here to say that it worth every second.,10
"This is a fantastic show through the 3rd episode. It is mysterious, it will tickle your sci-fi bone as well. It's gory so if you aren't into that pass on this. I love what Korea and Japan are producing right now!",9
"You don't have to be a Korean drama fanatic to enjoy Squid game, it is great, the VIP team is lacking but otherwise everything else is just perfect............okay this isn't actually happening somewhere right ????????????, with the desperation for money currently in the world I wouldn't be surprised??",10
"I could have done without the mandatory woke content from Netflix, as well as the nudity and useless profanity. This stuff brings nothing to the story. I started watching Korean shows because there is none of that, that is before Netflix started to produce content for this country. Other than that, good show and solid acting except for the vips, you know, the evil white men.",8
"First of all, this show will gut you like a fish and use your soul for chum. It's ultra-violent, graphic, and so intense that sometimes I felt sick. I cried a few times but mostly I was just becoming as damaged as the contestants. This show will MESS. YOU. UP. It is hella dark, hella bleak, and once you start it, you won't be able to stop until you know who wins the game. I need Season 2, please.This is NOT Alice in Borderland!!! This is NOT The Hunger Games!!! This isn't Battle Royale.Yes, the same most basic of premise is there. But this show stands alone.Watch it at your own peril. But Watch It.",8
"Very addictive. The most intense tug of war scene ever. This show will keep you curious, entertained and anxious the whole time. By the time the show is over you're left with a strange taste in ur mouth, mostly because the protagonist makes some very stupid choices that make no sense, this dude just keeps testing his luck assuming it will never run out. Anyways, this show runs back and forth from the depths of human depravity to the better angels of our nature. Definitely worth watching.",9
"Many people talk highly of this show, so I had high expectation. It was good but some things made me disappointed. SPOILER ALERT. Too much plot armour for the police. How did he manage to infiltrate the place with so much security? And how lucky he is to be one of the recruit traitor and get the square mask? The Front Man said the biggest value of this game is equality, yet some participants manage to bring in some tools, and peek their game preparation. Ali lost because he got cheated, not through a legit game. So much for equality bruh. Sometimes the recruit is like not exist at all, they supposed to make sure all the participants play fairly. The last game was the most boring game. It's just like watching teenagers fighting pathetically. And the biggest thing that ruined the show is the ending. Gi-Hun suddenly become a high morale person, trying to catch the game organizer that he abandon his daughter! He was introduced as non responsible person, doesn't work hard, and love gambling, why he suddenly need to be so heroic??? He even cheated with the old man.",6
"My score should be 8.5, but I will round it up.The bad:Questionable ending which is suggesting a season 2VIPs acting and visit purposePolice substory is lacklusterThe good:Well written and thrilling story inspired by multiple works in this genre, but piecing some of the best of each (Kaiji, Alice in Borderland, etc.)Different perspectives are brought to the table and the story allows the viewers to know a lot of the different characters.Original soundtrack matched the situation quite wellKR actors acting.",9
"Regardless of the plot, subject matter, etc, this was overall some of thee best acting I've ever seen. Keep in mind I'm disregarding the VIPs lol. But this movie is making me feel things I absolutely did not expect at all going into this, lol. I feel ""truth"" from almost every main cast member. Honestly, it's a brilliant performance and, if it were a movie and shot to be a movie, I'd see it making waves in American mainstream similar to Train to Busan. A+++ to the actors, wow, the character arcs in this are awesome to watch.",9
"Your eyes will stick to the series hours by hours. I cried, laughed, and feared at the same time. K-drama is always worth watching!",9
"I'm sure by this time most of you have seen this series and I'm glad to have watched it as well the minute it came out in Netflix. For those who haven't, there are a lot of memes and clips showcased in FB and Tiktok..and in all honesty watching this is an absolute treat.We are all aware by now how Koreans can leave us in awe when it comes to the series or movies that they create. And Squid Game is an interesting and unique concept, something that left me fascinated until the end. Some may think that it is just a series with gruesome games involved, but frankly that is the part which makes it exciting like hell.Short but sweet as it only contained 9 episodes, and although the ending will keep us curious and wanting for more, it's enough for me to understand the plot and message it meant to deliver.Would you want a Season 2? I know I would.",10
"I would give the set design for this series a ""10."" The rest of the show is not very good.Too much of the ""plot"" is obvious. You know the antihero main character will be the one to survive from the very beginning. You know the old man is behind everything because he's an anomaly and, unlike everyone else, has no reason to be in the game. Also, he's number 001, a real giveaway. You know there's some sort of relationship between the ""head man"" and the cop. You know the last game will be the ""squid game."" There are also other obvious things that come out in the first two episodes.The first episode is overlong; there's way more than the needed exposition to set up the plot to move on. The second through seventh episodes are the best, but there aren't many real surprises aside from the excellent set designs. The last two episodes are truly awful and boring. When the indefatigable cop ""disappears"" into the sea, you know that there will be a second season. But the final ending where the main character turns back from boarding the plane is really embarrassing; he might as well have held up a sign saying ""Be sure to watch Season 2.""All of the characters have the depth of comic book personae, especially the ""evil"" ones. The fact that none of them are believable characters wouldn't be a problem if the writers didn't try to create melodramatic moments when we're supposed to actually care about them and believe in their plights. No one in their right mind would leave hell and then let circumstances change their mind and therefore decide to re-enter a situation that leads to certain death.""Squid Game"" reveals many of the problems that plague most of Netflix's movies and series: They are bloated, overlong, and stretched-out in order to fill up a required amount of time. Even the very best of ideas can't sustain themselves indefinitely, and ""Squid Game"" is the umpteenth repetition of ""The Most Dangerous Game"" (1924) by Richard Connell. Combine this with Agatha Christie's ""And Then There Were None"" (1939) and you have the bases for many of the horror and adventure stories and films of the last 80 years. ""Squid Game"" doesn't add much that's new, besides some great set designs.",3
"Best series of 2021. The series is very beautiful and interesting, a unique series, and the actors were excellent.",10
"A really good series its only need better writing, think carefully about the quotes, for the next season it will be epic if it was in Spain with Spanish actors.",8
A refreshing mixture of many genres to form a brand new standard!No spoilers here because this is one to watch and explore for yourself!I'd just say this much that I watched this by chance and been watching for 6 hours straight!Definitely one to watch!,9
"This series was overated by viewer, try to watch this and Believe me this series was just typical korean movie. Too much drama. Like every korea movie, life conflict, problem blah blah...you expect this in any korean movie.",1
"Most of Hollywood and almost every single(once beloved franchise) turned their backs on the customers. Too busy to lecture us and shove their woke religion down our throats but many other countries still make movies and series to entertain. To give us escapism, good story lines, thrills, believable characters with backgrounds and struggles, some who you despise, some who you care for, many of them grey and no political propaganda.No obvious message from the rich elite in Hollywood. No forced identity (with the exception of the elite watching the fights (poor acting, the sole downside of the movie) but real identities (e.g. Different characters).No all-powerful protagonists. Not total conformism. When a girl or woman fights a man it's believable and no preaching. I love it. No endless preaching from the hypocrites (which constantly pulls you out of the movie experience) but good 'le inventive and exciting entertainment.This is a high quality dystopian series from our Korean friends.If you are sick to the back teeth of modern day Hollywood sensibilities and microagressions like 95% of mankind then watch this macro aggression series. Highly recommended.",9
"This Korean drama/series makes me remind of black mirror a lot because of the system of the game and the VIPs. I didn´t like how the VIPs talked because it seems they were reading... This serie talk about the things that someone is capable of doing to earn money, even kill the dearest person for you. Not everything it is what seems in this drama.",9
"I applaud you for the work that went into a lot of balls and for trying a drama that is rare in Korea as a Korean. But on the other hand, there were a lot of cliché scenes that I felt like I had seen somewhere, and there were a lot of parts that I didn't understand why the story continued and dragged like that. It was not a series of plausible and shocking reversals, but a series of plausible deaths and deterrence. The script is disappointing.",4
No doubt it is a one of the Best web Series. I recommend everyone to watch this.,9
"Dystopia theme, cool aesthetics, and ""deep"" ideas do not automatically make something good!!!To be fair, Episode 1 is funny: slapstick and dark humour. And the overall concept, deadly games, is cool. But that's about it. This series is BADLY ACTED, BADLY SCRIPTED, and CRINGEWORTHY throughout.Over-acting makes it hard to take any *deep* conversation seriously.Many conversations are too long and unnecessary - as if the director's just killing time until the next game (the games seem to be the only thing he's good at.)There's some overly dramatic scenes that aren't built up to enough by the plot (e.g. Everyone tries to massacre each other in the night in episode 2 already - before they even got chance to start hating each other...).Many scenes are plain cliché/cringeworthy. Would YOU cry your eyes out at the death of the ""bad guy"" who's just murdered your lady? Cry and cry at your nemesis's death, because you're such a ""good guy""? Ridiculous.The final twists are unnecessary and annoying. I'd rather have seen some better quality acting and scriptwriting throughout.I could say more, but can't be bothered wasting any more time. I already lost 8 hours watching this - and 598 brain cells.",2
Hey guys I'm karan and I belong to India and im 19 years old this series is great I like it all actors very good paforamce.,10
"Positive surprise, we know long ago that there is no more creative movies or shows from US, everything is just copy paste zero creativity. This show was so unique and strange I really enjoyed it. It starts really slow and I almost gave up on it. But once the first game starts the crazy stuff starts happening.. great work guys !P. S to Netflix Bring back Real PRIME STAR TREK YOU MORON. S ! I will unsubscribe!",9
"If you can get past the dubbing, this is a brilliant nail biter...unlike anything I have seen before...I would HIGHLY recommend.",8
"Squid game has set an extremely high bar for other shows of this genre. It is intense. It is raw. It is an emotional roller coaster. This is a masterpiece throughout. I actually felt that the poor VIP acting was a good metaphor of modern Hollywood when compared to the incredible performances by some of the main cast members here. I sincerely hope they continue the series in the same style and it does not get the SAW franchise treatment.But Episode 6 - Gganbu.... So powerful. Possibly the best single episode of a show I have ever seen.More, more, more please.",10
"For me, the first few episodes was a definite 8 in my books. But it started to be a bit boring and predictable in the last couple episodes. The glass game did not feel like an old children game. A new take on hopscotch perhaps. When the old guy appeared again at the end, I saw this coming, the second they showed the back of the head of The Host. This happened after Player 001 supposedly died in game 3. I was more surprised that I guessed right rather than his screen time in the final episode. Also I didn't get Frontman's motivation. He looked like the leader, but actually a yes man. He left his brother cop looking for him to be just that? A rich man yes man. Hmmm...so I did not understand this bit/character. I find a rather loose story about the brothers.Then we have Gi Hun With his decision at the end. He finally gets a chance to start over with his daughter, the one thing he wants more than anything else. Instead he went back for seconds. No wait, thirds. I guess setting the narrative this way opens the possibility of a season 2.I get the high ratings and hype, but beneath it all its a not-too-bad series worthy of a 6.",6
"This series is mind blowing. Fast paced thriller action, I haven't blink my eyes during whole series.",10
"10/10 great tv series, must watch unlike any other series you watched/",10
"You get into in at first but then it gets very slow, too many conversations, and it moves so slow you get tired of watching. Fast forwarded half of season. Could've been much better.",5
After long i get master piece from korean web series bt only disspointment is vip s role.,10
"This film try too hard to be another Parasite but fail in many way.About the battle royale, main character is way too useless from the beginning to the end. He contributed almost nothing to the game. His arc is just too simple, nothing significant changed. The games are designed simple and pure by chance most of them. It required nothing smart or outstanding physical.The VIP and bad guys are stupid as heck. Who write those characters ?The plot twist is not that twist anymore since you can easily guess it. Who haven't seen that classic horror movie franchise ?There are a lot of better movies out there in battle royale or social issues. This one does not earn its score.",6
You love characters who are good and you actually hate those who are bad. It's that good. Ignore the VIP!!!!,9
This show has it all. The English dubbed version is a bit cheesy but it's acceptable. The show itself is gory so if that's not your thing don't watch. It is heart wrenching. I wasn't expecting this.,9
"This show sucked me in on the first episode. The acting is superb and the plot is great. The only issue is the VIPs, that's where the acting is bad and writing fell apart. Luckily the VIPs are only in one episode so it doesn't ruin the entire series. I binged this on Netflix after watching one episode. Hoping for a season 2.",9
"I absolutely love this show, the story is great, character development, and basically everything keeps you interested in it. I'd say the first 2 episodes aren't as good as the following 7, but that's part of the good stuff. There are many plot twists that blew my mind, and I will defo watch it again <3Something that really made me ""cringe"" were the VIP's. Their scripts didn't feel natural enough and this is something that happens in almost every K-Drama or any Korean movie; they try and force Americans/foreigners in the movie and their scripting is just not good.",9
"Fun series, but lacks the psychological complexity and extreme levels of suspense we know from Kaiji. That said, Kaiji I was so intense I had to pop a couple Xanax while watching it to keep from having a panic attack.Squid Game isn't Kaiji, but the productions looks nice and it's entertaining enough. The narrative relies on well-established tropes, making the story highly predictable. You will probably guess the ""twist"" at the end very early on. So watch Squid Game if you are looking for an afternoon of light entertainment, just don't expect it to explore any uncharted territory.If you were hoping for something a bit more psychological, but without the unfettered intensity of Kaiji, then check out LIAR GAME. I like really enjoyed the 2014 Korean remake with Lee Sang-yoon.",7
"Just binged season, i was hooked after the second episode.After seeing the vip's i went looking for some reviews. Boy... the acting was so out of place. It felt so weird, upon the VIP encounter the acting was really good. It kinda breaks the whole atmosphere.Nevertheless definitly worth watching.",8
Besides a few bits of bad acting this series was very entertaining.??,9
Devastatingly perfect. This level of gorgeousness should not be possible. Shakespearean in stature. Prepare all your human emotions for a descent into the core of the human condition.,10
"I was engrossed! Very interesting story and characters UNTIL the last episode. I just could have done without the boo hoo blah blah sentimental ""here is why"" explanation. I believe that was obvious. The most worthy of friendships in the game was ruined for me in the last episode.It's worth a go. It teaches age old lessons again but it's always worth learning them, again.",7
"Just don't count on cops for real, when comes to a situation like this. They get paid monthly and they are hired by the goverment. They don't know you. Count on yourself and your community which is organic. Asians need to grow up and seek for help from anything other than a strong government.",8
"One of the best series i have ever watched in my life (and i watched a lot!).However that VIP acting was the most rerrible acting i have ever seen in my life. Terrible.On the contrary everything else about the serieswas top notch quality. Acting? 10. Screenplay? 10 Director? 10 Camera angles? 10
Game rooms? 10/10.",10
"Absolutely fabulous! Truly fabulous. I was terribly bummed to read so many reviews that claim the subtitle translation was bad; as an English-only speaker, proper translations are paramount. I never watch English language dubs as they are horrible compared to watching (and hearing real characters voicing their parts) in the original language with the subtitles on.In all honesty, this likely would have been a '10' had it not been for some slow areas in episodes 1, 2, & 9. That's not to say that they were bad, but there is a necessity for backstory that is handled in these episodes (or post-story, re: ep9) and to me there were some wasted opportunities. Nonetheless, the show is definitely binge worthy. I went through it in two days and am hopeful they'll do another season.Extremely well produced, a super cool mix of fantasy, action, and drama with a novel story line. But hey...what's up with Lee Byung-hun not being credited in IMDB for his cameo as The Frontman? I get that the ""walking around"" character didn't need to be Byung-hun, but it was such a surprise to see his face behind the mask that he needs to be credited.",9
"This is the best ""Death Game"" / ""Battle Royal"" type of show I've seen in years. There are a dime-a-dozen of these shows in the anime / Japanese world and Squid Game is the best one in a long while. What's usually wrong with these shows is that they have a super natural element (gods, aliens) to them or outrageous reasoning as to how or why these games are evening taking place. That and the general writing is kind of ... well ... awful ... since these shows are usually about mass killing and the sick ways contestants have to be punished rather than concentrating on the actual characters.It's the well written character dialogues and backgrounds that keep you hooked, not the senseless violence on screen. Squid Game understands this. The best episodes are the ones with no direct violence to them. They will crush you.In other shows ""aliens"" or what seems to be literally a handful of people are running the whole thing. That's not good enough for me. Squid Game keeps it simple. Humans (a lot of them actually) run the show, and humans kill each other. I really appreciate the logistical side of the show, it keeps it grounded.As for the negatives, there is a small subplot involving a doctor that's really not that relevant to the show. Later in the season there's a group of people that you'll encounter and they are horribly acted. You'll notice it immediately when you get to it. Otherwise, amazing show, hope for another successful season 2 in the future.",9
"Loved this series and how it kept me hooked until the very end. The very last game and conclusion were rather mediocre and was a cheap method at opening up the doors to a Season 2, but everything up until that point were a clear 9/10.If you love competitive death game/escape room movies/shows, this is one you should not pass on.",8
"Humans vs humans is a no brainer for writers. Be it Hunger Games, 13, The Hunt, or Surviving the Game, I as well as others, for what ever reason, are going to watch...in spite of the quality.My first concern was the acting, not the actors ability, but them acting like Koreans. Are Koreans usually this giddy and overly reactive in certain situations? The main character at the horserace or with his daughter was uncomfortable to watch, but it could be it didnt translate well. As for the VIP, a lot of criticism has been on their acting, but does it matter since the Korean version would have translated there words for them? If so, they could have been spouting gibberish and the subtitles for the Korean audience would have remedied that easily.As with the aforementioned films, this one lacks a punch ending. Writers just dont seem to find a ending that is as strong as the beginning. The last game had none of the emotional power and cleverness of the prior ones. The 5th left something to be desired also, except to resolve an issue between two characters.I suffered through all of my criticisms, and you should as well. It is just such a strong idea, wish someone could deliver an ending.",6
"It was fun, but the show falls back on usual Korean story tropes (ie forced deaths to make ""cool"" sacrifices) , the acting by the VIPs was so laughibly bad and cringy that it almost tanked the whole show, and some stuff is stupid and makes no sense at all.Examples (spoilers!)1. The players keep acting like they can win the game together and get out of there together with the money, again and again. It's made 100% clear that they either can't stop playing until one person is left alive, or they can end things with a majority vote but then don't get the money. No one ever mentions this again or acklowedges that anyone they bond with will die if they want that money.2. They all left the game and then choose to come back, knowing the above... but a husband and wife joined again. They tried to make it a shocking and surprising thing that this poor couple are made to face each other to the death, but by choosing to come back they knew that one of them would have to die. Really dumb!3. The first time when they quit they say the accumulated money will go to the families of the deseased. When they return that money is still in the piggy bank and they continue from where they left off.4. The missing brothers stuff is in the goshiwon and it seems like rent was skipped for a month, so the cop brother says he will pay the rent and looks through his stuff, goes looking for him because of that card. Later we see in a file that he won the game years ago, and it seems he's been working as the front man for a good long time too. Um...didn't he just go missing recently?4. They gave my fav character a super cheap death. Cmon, random exploding glass took her out? She's there to play the games and no one notices she's been impaled or offers some medical attention so she can compete still...when they say it's all fair? How did they know there damn stupid exploding glass trick would not take everyone out and end the games by mistake? It was just a set up for that 3 in the sleeping area with knives scene, but was too forced.5. They took all interest and moral dilemma out if the ending by neatly killing off everyone, keeping the good guys hand s clean, and making the other guy a clear villain.6. The main character gets stabbed twice in the final fight but carries on fairly easily, but the other guy gets bit in the foot and that's it...becomes completely defenseless after that. The whole ending after that was very forced.7. The red hair thing was a little stupid. As was the case off money for the old lady and child - looks cool but how is she gonna use that or explain it when putting it in a bank? Her son is missing for fraud and the cops already visited her. In the same vein - him becomg a sudden multibillionaire didn't attract any attention from the tax office?8. When he got off the plane at the end: we went full circle and killed the character development because the last thing he does is impulsive, prob gonna get him killed (no way he can take on this shadow group with red hair and some cash - he's easily dead) and he lied and failed his daughter. Again.9. They didn't tie off a few things. The Morse code thing went nowhere if I'm not mistaken. The guy didn't do anything to get that mom back from N Korea.10. Also, cop guy infiltrates stupidly easily - and his iphone battery life is AMAZING. No way there's a charging cable laying around in a facility were no phones are allowed. Even Mr head honcho has to use a land line.11. Will normal people playing games really randomly all out try to kill each other at night? They say they provide less food to stoke tension, but there was enough for everyone if that group didn't cut in line for seconds. No way they'd know that would happen. And it certainly wouldn't guarantee a bloodbath. It's normal people in debt, not hardened criminals (apart from the one guy).And that's about what I remember. It was fun, but a little stupid too. It started very strong and could have been GREAT, but the writing needed tightening up and less reliance on formulaic tropes.",7
I'm watching this on Netflix and with the dubbing it's like watching an anime.,7
One of the best shows I've seen in a long time. Acting was pretty good and the story and plot were crazy.,10
I m speechlesss. Love this series.. One of the best.,10
Honestly Netflix can not make many good American shows without a bunch of woke politics and other trash. This show is god damn amazing!!! Its so dark and twisted.,10
"A fantastic tale of a group of humans, laden with debt, play games in the hope of winning cash prize.Great acting, interesting plot glues you to the series, from start to end.This is not just another play a game of death story.Squid game definitely raises the bar on drama and story telling.",10
"Ep.2 & 6 are easily the top tier episodes. They built tension and characters right. It's a great story. Easily ""A"" tier series until..... The ending.YES, Great story telling, the tension and flow and ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS TO STICK THE LANDING RIGHT and it FAILED. Resulting into a dragging episode and an 8 episodes wasted. I also have to mention ep.4 "" Rumble at night/ lights turn flashing"" scene, it's a bad idea filming against the light or in a dark area, let alone filming with flashy lights (hahahah). It's an unspoken rule but important, I nearly puke and I didn't know what is going on at that scene. That scene is bad but not as TRASH as the ending. Still, I enjoy the series but the ending makes me feel I wasted a cry at episode 6. And BTW, VIP's = CRINGE.",7
"This is fantastic! I watched the version dubbed in English, and it felt natural, not forced. Such a cool story, each episode is exciting and good fun. People have said they don't like the VIPs acting, but I think it's appropriate for those characters to have no real depth, they're supposed to be superficial people. Have a watch for an ace fun series, I watched the lot over a couple of nights :D.",10
"Fly Me to the Moon
Let me play among the stars
Let me see what spring is like on
A Jupiter and Mars
In other words, hold my hand
In other words, baby, kiss meNow imagine listen to that calming jazz melody, sipping some wine, and watching more than 400 people getting murdered playing some kid's games.A brand new Netflix Korean thriller. This is kinda like Korean version of Alice in Borderland. However, the twist to the familiar premise was amazing. Most of the games were incredibly nerve-racking. The first and fourth games were for sure my favorite. They made me grabbing my pillow, while showing cruel ways desperate people resorted to do to save themselves. Because of this, whenever the game started, I became excited and more thrilled.However, the characters were for the most part generic and categorical. Honestly I didn't care much for them, and just wanted the games to start. However, some of them actually had some sad stories, like the two girls in game number four. Then, near the end there's these English-speaking VIPs that were annoying as heck mostly because of the unnatural way they talked. I'm not sure why they had to speak like they are the final bosses. There's also a subplot about a cop, which didn't pay off well enough at the end.Overall, despite the straightforward characters, I still had an amazing time with this show. Pretty sure season 2 will be made because not everything was resolved. 8/10#**THIS PART IS SPOILER SO STOP OF DON'T WANT SPOILER**Well of course, game 4, the marble games, was the best one because the stuff that the characters pulled to fool the others were sad and shocking. Then game 1, red light green light, was shocking and fun. Probably the most nerve-racking one out of all of them. Then game 5, the jumping glass, was also intense as heck. Game 2 wasn't as intense, but still bloody. When it was revealed, I and the main guy realized how screwed he was. Then game 3, tug of war was fine, but the tricks were pretty surprising. Gotta equip those tools. Finally, game 6 was lackluster and didn't have as much impact as I wanted. It was over a bit too quickly and didn't feel special. But yeah, that's my ranking of all the rounds in this first season.",8
"I liked Squid Game, it's refreshing to watch something of this genre besides all the overload of romcoms and other shallow programs that are offered. The camerawork, settings, acting is wonderful (minus the foreign VIPS, oh my god I really hope Korea stops casting those wannabe caucasion actors, cuz they can't act even if their life depends on it, cringe level 1000!)A few minus points: the white actors (VIPS) as mentioned above. Also, the pace is really slow. And A LOT of things were very predictable. Sometimes I was just plain bored, and that isn't a good thing if it's a thriller/suspense genre series, right?Overall there were somewhat interesting characters and a few good moments about bonds, but still, there was something lacking. I wasn't shocked or on the verge of tears when someone died or when a emotional scene happened. Also, the main character was unlikable. He showed a great ethic belief during the games, but then he didn't show much growth (after the games he's still a good for nothing loser).Alice in Borderland on the other hand, has more fantasy elements, but a fast pace combined with unusual turns of events that makes you really sit on the edge of your seat.Last, but not least: please watch it in the original audio (Korean) with subtitles. DON'T watch it dubbed. Don't be lazy cuz you'll have to read subtitles, because firstly, it's not a big deal, and secondly, you'll miss so much emotion, humor and whatnot if you watch dubbed versions (of anything, really). SUB > DUB.",8
"I'm Korean, and people around me kept telling me to watch this show so I decided to try it. Definitely exceeded my expectations. It brought much more emotional attachment that many Western shows, and I liked how the show wasn't very predictable. For example, I loved OBX but it felt a little repetitive to the point I started watching it more for the characters than the plot itself. However, this show really did well in terms of both the character development and plot.Also, I've seen reviews saying the Netflix subtitles were inaccurate. But idk, I thought it was well written (as a bilingual person) I loved the dubbings too bc the voices really matched.Lastly, to address the VIP scene, many people said they were poor actors and had cringe lines.I think the lines embodied the American culture pretty well for a Korean crew. At this point, yall should be thankful it wasn't worse. Also, since not a lot of foreigners live in Korea, it would have been difficult to pick up actual actors for the show.",10
"First off, I wanted to give this show a 7-star rating. As many other comments say, the horrendous, cringeworthy casting of the VIP's drag this down a star in itself. It literally ruined a whole episode. It almost seems surreal just how bad they are at acting.Apart from this though, the show is very gripping with a great idea behind it. Had the idea been executed to perfection, this should would easily be a 9, and maybe even 10. I'm not a big fan of the extreme acting that's often practiced in Korean movies, and this isn't any different. The actors play well, no doubts, but sometimes it's just too much.Scenery, camera-work and story is all pretty well done.But really, what makes this series unique and worth watching is the idea behind it. No matter if you like the korean film-style / acting, you should definitely give this one a watch - you won't regret it.",6
"Great plot, great acting, and all around great show. One of the best series I've seen on netflix in a very long time. Korean cinema is absolutely the best with their story telling. 10/10!!",10
The best K Netflix Series I've seen recently.Hope they will release season 2 and 3 and moreeeee!!,10
"For those who did not understand the psychological projection of the series. Basically, The series discusses the brutality of the capitalist economy system in such a clever way that you'll definitely notice and say when you're watching ""that character is me!"".It is that under the dominance of the capitalist system all people are in a race to get money that only one person takes in the end. The same money that come from the blood and sweat of others.The capitalist system claims that there is equity And justice in the distribution of the wealth. And this is far from the truth.As for the big capitalists who control the big capitals and companies that run the entire process, money is no longer their pleasure. That they only find pleasure in people suffer.",8
Got sucked in immediately by all of it. Was blown away by the performances too. Each actor does an incredible job. I too was derailed by the VIP characters' dialogue.,9
This is a hard movie to watch but something that could happen in real life too. Good acting by the main characters.,9
"It is quite hard to review the whole series . Because each episode gives a unique portrait .The idea is good old fashion Japanese way with some new modern technology. The main concept is well demonstrate. My best moment is at the last one, when the main hero and a old man playing games weather the homeless guy will get help or not.The rich see the world in another sense. But the life goes on inhuman way towards the poor people. This series gives some visual, good concept , business and class exploitation with Japanese work culture. Among 9 episode the 3 episodes are good. Over all good for nice time pass.",6
The story line is way too predictable and there are too many plot holes. 5 stars are for Hoyeon .,3
Not original at all but refreshing to see this theme played by good Corean actors.Apparently the gender and bla agenda is not a must for Corean series. Which is fine by me.,6
"The story of the police officer was just pointless. He achieved nothing, other than killing like 2 random people.",7
"The storyline is familiar. We have seen this before. From the original Battle Royale to the Hunger games, and the most recent Alice in Borderland.What makes the Squid game stand out is definitely the character development of the main characters. You got to know them, you hate them, you feel sorry for them, you love them;+ Great acting from the actors and actresses.+ I like the games, not complicated but simple recognizable games.+ different from others we got an undercover police man in the staff of the game. This was refreshing to see the other side and not only focusing on the characters in the game. And the guy who is playing the undercover is an eyecandy to watch.Less enthusiastic about:some predictable plots, like the main character will survive till the end.somehow I knew the frontman was the brother of the undercover police man, but why and how did he end up as the frontman?-the VIPS, please delete their part. Terrible fake acting.the final episode, of course they finish with the squid game, but It was not so excited like the previous games. Also towards the end was disappointing.Fun factThe main character resembles Hong Kong actor Sean Tam.",9
"An outstanding piece of Korean Television drama. If you can see it with the subtitles and not the dubbed version, do so. As others have said the dubbed version is atrocious.This literally is as I have described above. A motley group of Koreans are given the chance to compete for a huge cash prize in a fierce competition where the soon find out to lose means death.Nearly 500 competitors are plucked from all walks of society to take part. What do they all have in common? Poverty or huge debts or both. The eclectic bunch of men and women complete some times against each other and some times in small teams on a string of games which soon sees their number dwindle to a few dozen.While we focus on a few key characters, some of whose lives have collided outside of the game, there's various subplots including one very improbable narrative about organ trafficking. Where the show is strongest, is simply when it focuses on the games themselves and the moral dilemmas the characters have to face. (One man is forced to kill his wife in one round, although several of my school mates would tell you that is a good thing)There are some stand out performances from the ensemble cast, inventive production design and excellent visuals.I don't want to say more for fear of spoilers. Definitely worth your time.",8
"A breath taking series
A game of wealthy and pain through pleasure beasts in human form, against desperate people for money...
Betting their precious lifes just for one to take the price and get out alive
Would you play?Watch it now!!!",9
Far too long for a plot that only stole some ideas from Cube or Saw. Poor acting and boring dialogues. Please avoid this one!,4
.... And it'll do its job. The games gave me anxiety and goosebumps. Definitely worth watching a few episodes at a time.,10
"I didn't want to watch this because the thumbnail on Netflix looked like cheap Money Hiest rip off. The trailer had me little intriqued but I've had my fair share of battle royale. Then I watched it and I am so glad I did.This isn't just a rip off of Battle Royale, Hunger games or Alice in Borerlands. This series speaks of the lives, desperation and morality of poor people vs the rich and their filth. Almost as if it was inspired by The Parasite. It's not the first time we have seen the wealthy bet on the poor but this time it's executed well. The deep dive into different characters and their plight really works here. This time it's not just the players but we get to peek into staff and leaders too. The motive makes sense. It's not just filthy rich making poor fight.I liked how they took the childhood games and put a deadly spin on it. When it gets dark it really does get dark. I had a couple of people I was rooting for. My favorite character is player 001. I instantly fell in love with his character and almost all the scenes he is in, are delightful to watch.All the actors have done great job. There are characters you hate, some that are just so annoying you wish they were dead, heroes, faux heroes, unfortunates, unlucky. Technically this movie is well made violence and gore is not gratuitous. Twists are well written, editing could've been tighter, cinematographer captures the South Korean streets and lives well enough, background score was okay. Humor is well knitted.This is a must watch on Netflix. I doubt there will be a season two and there isn't any scope of it.",8
"This is a must watch. It speaks for itself. It's violent yes, but the characters are alive with plenty of personality. Pure quality. Perfect storyboarding and addictive. Yes, the weakest part is the WIPs but the rest is perfect.",9
"My first Korean TV series I have seen all episodes. Wao I love it like there are violence scenes that go over the border, and good stories of rich and poor, what money do to people in difficult times in life.",8
"This show start amazingly thrilling, until the fourth game this show became predictable and the characters are overacting, unlike the VIPs their acting make me cringe to the bone.The fourth game was great tho, Ali's innocence face got me, seo-byeok and ji-yeong friendship, Il-nam the old man (and we found out that he is the founder of the squid game), and the policeman finally met his brother and he's dead like for what?Lastly, the ending, the ending was too long and boring.",7
"I've never watched a series like this before. From the characters behavior's stand due the game time to pains in their civil life is effect your brain in the existential sense way. They show us mankind could do everything for some stupid piece of paper with a small games that we played in our childhood. On the other hand as the games progress, you witness other games played behind the scenes and the taste of the series starts to get better. Omg! I don't want to give you spoiler! Just watch it. I hope the second season will airs.",8
"Beginning was amazing. However, the sanctimony and dreariness of the main character made it increasingly more difficult to watch. Kang Sae-byeok, for example, would've made a far superior main character. Then, VIPs we're utterly disappointing. What was even the point of Jun Ho, other than being a filler?! Also, this secret organization kidnaps and murders 456 Koreans annually in a very short and specific period of time, yet no one ever notices? Altogether, the concept has potential, but the obvious threads to Saw franchise and insufferable main character just didn't do it for me.",5
"Seriously. All things considered, they're a pretty small and self-contained part. The main characters were brilliant in their roles. I guess good actors figured that having parts where they're wearing masks the whole time wouldn't get them much exposure. The pacing and character development were superb.",9
"What a treat ! Edgy, emotional. Above all ? Disturbing. I wasn't expecting much to be honest. Oh boy was I wrong.Nicely produced, almost perfectly executed. You feel the tension from start to finish. The actors are are spot on (apart from the VIP's in episode 7).You feel and want to know more about them.This is how good it is.Have a go, you won't regret it.Pure entertainment.",9
"Been an avid reader and viewer of several survival games, thriller and suspense series, this series is so predictable and draggy it really feels painful at some points. A 1 minute dialogue can get dragged to a 10 minutes dialogue with simple shouting, gesturing and lots of unnecessary activity.Even though the premise is supposed to be on the real world, it is seriously not realistic. Too much plot armor, plot holes, character personality inconsistencies, unexplained events and so on. It's basically for people who like plot twists but do not think whether it is consistent or reasonable. But one thing holds true, plot armor is stronger in this series than most of the ludicrous manga/ anime/ K-drama/ movie etc. Etc. Series I have seen.As I was browsing around, I found an article saying that the initial inspiration for Squid Game came from an unnamed comic book. Ahh, now I see why. It's basically a typical death survival game plot but heavily tweaked to reflect South Korean culture (unaccepting of foreigners, high household debt, the belief that women are inferior to men etc.And that is why the storyline is inconsistent, choppy, have plenty of plot holes and plot armor in a lot of sections. Because the production crew does not let its characters tell a story, and there was much ""micromanagement"" in order to produce the desired results.It could have been much better, but it's really boring from Episode 6 because it suddenly became incredibly inconsistent, which also made it incredibly predictable. This is where the ""micromanagement"" starts being especially prominent.Overall, it started out great, but went downhill quickly, especially from episode 6.Oh, and Squid Game is a clickbait title. I guess the production crew wanted to draw interest to traditional South Korean games eh? Maybe this film is partly an introduction of South Korean childhood games and social culture to the world. Even the North-South Korean dispute was touched upon, but more in the sense of the difficulties of the detractors.In summary, too much agenda, too little plot.",3
Squid game is a conventional drama which is dipicted on living experience of human being addicted to capitality. The various games in the drama is showing a testimony that people are living for.People.,10
"First of all, I'll talk about what I like! The concept is great, it drags you in and makes you want to binge the show right until the end, the art direction is also fantastic, taking what is essentially a very dark subject matter and giving it a child like aesthetic is very jarring but in an enjoyable way.Characterisation has its ups and downs, the main protagonist is initially presented as a dead beat who steals from his own mother to gamble, but through small actions you get the full picture that while he's a bit of a waster, he has a heart of gold.Other characters not so much, there's an edgy North Korean female character who's lines made me genuinely cringe. ""I don't trust people"" is one of the lines that stuck out for me, I dislike when a character has to state one of her character traits to let the audience know it is in fact one of her character traits.The dubbing is also awful, I don't know who was in charge of it, whether is was Netflix themselves or a 3rd party but it's woeful, like really bad.I'd still recommend the show though, it's an enjoyable watch regardless of its flaws. 7/10.",7
"This series is one you have to stick through, I did want to turn it off because it took a while to get to the point, but I'm glad I didn't. Only thing I was not a fan of was the VIPs, they're very unnecessary and could have been left out. Other than that, it is put well together and detailed. I enjoyed it.",8
"Those of you complaining about the VIPs are completely missing the point. This show is so damn clever. The VIPs are meant to be over the top, gaudy, and obnoxious. They're representing the type of rich, entitled aholes that enjoy this kind of entertainment. These are the same guys that would set up a game of hunting for humans. Fantastic show.",10
"Poetic yet Gruesome, the story shows the harsh reality of the world through a fictional series, modern slavery. They director succesfully make the audience to have roller coaster of emotions: suspense,relief,grief. They also give attention to small details that made the story truly brings out. The actors also played their role really well, enough that bond were built between the audience and the actors.",9
"This is the first Korean Series I have ever watched and I am glad I gave it ago.Lee Jung-jae (Seong Gi-hun #456) made this show for me. Given the fact he is the main character given the responsibility of capturing the audience during the initial introduction, he gave an amazing performance throughout the series.The show itself is a nice mix a gripponh dramatic thriller but with a slightly comedic element that wasn't forced. I liked the way you got a sense of background for each of the main characters. No doubt the costumes and symbolism is going to be iconic. So credit to Hwang Dong-hyuk for coming up with this concept.I think the performance of Anupam Tripathi (Abdul Ali #199) should also be commended. For a Korean Series to achieve such diversity in a show was great and he played his role to a tee.So all in all well played Korea and your spot at the top of many charts is quite an achievement. I gave it an IMDb 9, however really its a 10/10 from me.",9
"The switch from game to Vip lost my suspense a bit, as well as the Vip's couldn't act.But other than that an amazing nail biting show with amazing sets and actors.",10
One of the greatest shows I have seen in years. The VIP actors ruïned some parts unfortunately.,9
"This was well written, acted, executed. VIPs played their role. I don't know what people wanted from their screen time. Overall great show. Some scenes felt drawn out from time to time, but other than that. Great show.",9
Loved it. Hooked from the start. Well done! Hope there is a season 2!,10
"It's one of the best series I have seen in my life
The VIPs give some boring scenes to the show
But it still the show is 100% worth watching
If you have a good heart
I watched it in 1 day.",9
"Just binge the whole 9 episodes
And I will probably say it is one of the best series you will look after
The VIPs give some boring scenes to the show
But the show is still 100%worth
If you have already watched Parasite and loved it this series is for you
I will not recommend you this series in only one condition if you don't have a powerful heart.",9
"Guys.How can this show even be hyped ?It's easily in my top 5 of the worst series I've ever watched. I'm totally not kidding. I wasted 9 hours of my life for this trash, just to understand why people like it. And I don't get it. It's bad. It's more than bad. It's boring, it's predictable.And I'm not even talking yet about the absolute ridiculous acting.100% trash - at least for people with a little claim in good series. Trust me...",1
"What I loved most about this show is the acting was fantastic (with the exception of the white VIPs - they were terrible actors - perhaps on purpose), the backstories were believable and heart wrenching, and the suspense was very real. This wasn't violence for the sake of violence. I found myself rooting for certain characters and I was invested in the storytelling. The ending also didn't disappoint. One of the best Netflix shows I've seen. Very much looking forward to season 2. Also, viewing tip: don't watch with English voices dubbed over. Do the subtitles. It feels more real and genuine. You really get a sense of emotion in the voices.",8
"Good basic idea...
Being a big fan of battle royal, I was immediately attracted by the pitch of the series. But in the end, the series turned out to be a little too predictable in my opinion. It's not bad but I expected better.I also expected more ""gore"" scenes. So... Not bad, but I expected much better.It must be said that for me Battle Royal is almost ""unbeatable"" in the genre :)",5
I totally love it so i will give it 10/10. A s a matter of fact all actors were incredible in their acting but the vib were not.,10
"The acting, and graphic was good, the cast's acting me have no complain at all, its awesome, me love it.But, how about the story? Well, I would say the whole story was good, but there is some part that confusing, there is a lot of detail that need to be explained, I hope they explain the details in next season.",6
"This show is so well made. From a technical standpoint, it's shot beautifully and in a way to differentiate itself completely from other shows with similar tones. The lighting, the sets, the costumes, the locations, all fantastic!The idea is great! Most things made sense both story-wise and character-wise. There were a few moments that were questionable when it came to character decisions but it's very easy to look past those as the majority of Squid Game was fantastic. The entire second episode was pretty much dedicated to really making it clear to the audience WHY these characters would subject themselves to such a game and it's done in such a way where it's all very believable.I imagine there is, as always, some errors with Korean to English translation as some of the dialogue (in subtitle form) was incredibly on the nose and structured in a way where people simply don't talk that way but once again, it's easy to look past as the show is so interesting throughout and enjoyable.It felt more like a 9/10 hour movie, rather than a series as each episode flows so seamlessly into the next and carries the momentum, especially when binge watching.Highly recommended.",7
"Pros: acting, art direction, visuals, detailed storytelling
Cons: filler scenesWith more than a decade in making, Director Hwang Dong-hyuk has nailed this series, possibly allowing for more Korean creators to explore this genre.The acting by many of the characters in the show has been phenomenal. Their backstories were believable and emotional because of the emotions they conveyed (if being watched with original Korean audio + English subtitles, instead of English dub).The artistic design throughout the movie was aesthetically pleasing and creative as color choices in many scenes are intentionally done. And with that being said, the attention to detail carries this show beautifully.The only complaints while watching were the filler scenes; making the show feel as though it's dragging at some points. Some complained about the acting of the VIPs, but I think that was intentionally done by the creators.",9
"The plot is super interesting! It offers you almost identical storyline to the one of Alice in borderland, but it's even better. The characters are all round, none of them are flat. The gore is great and it does leave you on the brink of being creeped out by the events it creates. Love every bit of it. Moreover, the plot twist at the end is really well done, if you keep your eyes peeled at every little detail, you can figure it out yourself, but it's not really all that simple.Really recommend it to everyone. Very interesting and can't wait for season 2.",10
Nothing crazy the ending was pretty alright. I enjoyed it but people are going way too crazy over it. Most characters I just didn't really connect with and a lot of things were very predictable.,7
"Enjoyed a lot of it but..
It was predictable for the most part which is fine in most cases but I think a better plot twist at the end could've improved it. Also the Vip thing was weird and disappointing, the acting on them was... Pretty self explanatory.... Most characters were written quite well which I liked.",7
This is honestly the best series i have ever watched i finished it in one night and now i cant stop thinking about it everything about it is perfect the storyline the events are not exepcted a lot of plot twists i have every single emotion watching this stress anxiety anger happy and i mean it i will never regret watching it good job.,10
Turned off on the preview - the VIPs were that bad.,9
I'm not really into films with dubbing but this was done well so you don't even notice. Probably up there with my favourite every series.,9
It's super dark and intriguing and shows the lengths different humans will go out of greed. Messed with me a lot though sheesh.,10
I just created an account to rate this. Perfect korean thriller series! We need more of these.,10
"I'm not into Korean movies, but I actually binge watched this one. No way to stop until the end. Every episode is a crescendo, until the end.",9
"The Escher sets and the island hideaway that could have come from the Pinewood 007 stage are memorable but the programme is sunk by ithe moral vacuum at its core.SPOILERS ABOUND BELOW
Hundreds are despatched as so much deadwood so that we can have meaningful encounters with those granted speaking parts and they in turn dutifully expire so that the supposedly morally conflicted main character can feel a bit upset and buy off his complicity in the slaughter by chucking shedloads of his winnings at the sole dependent of one of the 400+ victims. Yes, he does look morose and affects appropriate hair growth to the point where he really must be saddened by the whole unpleasantness and even goes as far as having a salon dye his hair red (and do a terrible job at the rear - if you take away anything from this drama it is to ensure you get them to use a mirror to show you the back if you visit a barber in Korea).The contortions of probability required to support the reveal of the old man as the kingpin of the enterprise point to a rethinking of the physical world more radical than that proposed by Einstein and the logistics and financing of the operation are underpinned by no more than the fact that someone conceived of them in an idle moment and never troubled themselves to give it a second thought.The second series is a slam dunk but I'll follow the example of the few who chose not to return to the game - life outside may not always be a bed of roses but returning to the unpleasant stench of this narrative is a far worse proposition.",3
"If you liked any Black Mirror episode, imagine this series is 10 times better. Perversion, simplicity, emotion, action and drama, all in 1 package. A must watch.",10
"If you've already watched Alice in Wonderland and As Gods will, you're gonna be disappointed.The first 4 episodes were good, the plot was promising.And then came the Second half, which felt rushed and the writers out of ideas....
The plot with the VIP was already seen many times and it felt awkward and ridiculous. And the rest was over dramatic and the ""plot twists""/reveals so typical...
I felt like I've wasted my time with this series....",4
"The title of the movie is a little strange, but it is not surprising cuz most Korean movies have weird titles. However, it is quite entertaining, immersive, and highly addictive. Is season 2 going to be an octopus game?",9
"Very cool
Way way better than the Hunger Games.... Its in the same twisted vein as the recent Japanese TV series Alice in BorderlandA must watch.",10
"No dull moments, a show where the interactions and scenes really matter. If you watch carefully and pay attention the the players numbers there is a ton of foreshadowing.The acting is great, and Gi-hun's character growth is astounding. The games range from brutal, to jarring, to gut wrenching, to jaw dropping. Fairly gruesome.Terrific ending, but I can't imagine season 2 living up to this. Really great show can't recommend enough.",10
"I was hooked into the series right from the start. It has a good plot and getting to know the main character. From there it is a blast. Some people may find it disturbing, but it is a part if the show. You will have to watch it. Only down side is the last episode.",8
"The plot is exciting.. keeps the viewers on the edge of their seat.. but the ending is so rushed and not so great.. the final game chosen, the squid game is not so exciting especially for only 2 players .. then to make it worse it turned into a boring cliched knife fighting scene.. they should have chosen a more exciting game for a great climax..in the earlier part it's kinda weird that sang woo showed his caring side to Gi Hun in the first game but then suddenly in the second game he showed his selfishness just after he agreed to team up with him.. I get it sang woo is being competitive to win the money but it does not seem he looks at Gi hun as a threat and there are still many other opponents at that time..so why showed Sang woo's good side just to expose his selfishness so soon?And in the end I get it when sang woo suddenly has his conscience and finally let Gi Hun wins, because he knows Gi Hun is a nice guy that will make sure his mother will get somethingbut it is kinda boring that Gi Hun is being too nice and too kindhearted and wants to end everything at the edge of winning just to let that selfish sang woo lives...not after what sang woo did to everyone.. It will be more satisfying if Gi Hun just wins the game fair and square and just let sang woo be killed by that masked staffand at the end it is so irrational to use the sad emotional music while the mastermind is explaining why he did all that.. so are we suppose to feel sorry for him and forget how evil he truly is?And how does Gi Hun save himself from all the loan sharks for one whole year? He didnt use his money so there is no way he settled his debt with them..And I dont like it that Gi Hun left his plane in the end I mean for what? Yes he has won the game once but there is no way he can get his revenge he is no match for them..dont tell me after he is being depressed for one whole year than suddenly he will be heroic and all smart in the second season? (If there is any) Unless Jun Ho, the policeman is actually not dead maybe they can team up with Gi Hun's money and all the information that Jun Ho got, they might get somewhereand if it is really the end of Jun Ho, it is so bad to write him off just like that, not after he took so many risks to gather all the proves but to no use..The acting of most characters, the cinematography and the idea are nice, only I just wish it has a better ending.",5
"This show is really good. A 'BIT' like a Korean 'Hunger Games'. The story is great and the struggles that dominate the plot create a lot of great tension. It reeled me in right from the start. Give it an episode and you'll be hooked.The things that hurt it:EXTREMELY poor dubbing. A few of the character's voices are so comically bad that it's pretty cringey at times.One actress is absolutely terrible and should've been either played by someone else, or the part should've been written out. So bad.The VIPs are pretty ridiculous.Other than that, I look forward to another season. Not sure what they can do with it after such a great start.",7
"I get the premise.. I get the idea.. I just don't get the acting. You have characters acting super goofy at times and then super serious at other times.. like, not on a real world scale but a comical scale.. it's like watching Jim Carrey switch from Ace Ventura to Keanu Reeves' John Wick (in the beginning of the first one).. how are you gonna have a goofy nerd making absurd faces and dancing around like and idiot some badass later on? It makes no sense.. certainly have never witnessed this in any human behavior I've ever seen. It's like they wrote the part for 4 very different people and then combined it into one.. I give it points for originality but I hated the characters. They all could have died and it would have probably turned out better.",6
"Squid game offers everything you can ask for in a guilty pleasure gore filled thriller. They also take their time to really flush out the characters even with such a diverse cast, highlighting all aspects of humanity that would expect to see in a game of life and death.With a 9 episode run for this 1st season it's a great weekend binge show.",8
"This show is a great Korean drama adventure that will make the audience at their edge all the time, well written and great acting.Hands up for Netflix & Korea for deliver this show and looking forward for more cooperation to come in the near future.Unpopular opinion: This V. I. P characters acting is dumb and the way they talk is annoying but I think a human enjoy watching other people suffering has to be dumb and have a brain damage somehow!!",9
"The concept of the show is very unique and it was really interesting. But the show was really slow paced. So, if you don't have the patience you might even quit. Acting was good except the few VIPs whose acting were horrible. The show makes you emotional towards various characters.",8
"So good I can't even describe it , story acting everything is soooooo goooood !",10
Quite the unique show. I was hooked from the first episode. Haven't binged something in a long time but could not stop this one. Totally out of the box creatively. Loved it. Give it a watch.,10
"Way better than Hunger Games. Great story, actors, and moral choices and animal instincts of humans.",10
Entertaining and demonstrating human nature via this drama. My conclusion is not to be poor otherwise become a chess from rich.,7
"I don't know what to feel about this movie series. The main protagonist questioning the morality of others, where he obviously lacked it when he cheated against the old man (pre-character reveal). And still he continues to question the morality of the game even when it just started, it is already clear that you have to surrender your morality in order to survive.I also have to fast-forward some drama moments because they are very cliché to be honest.",3
Episode 6 really got me hard.Only thing is the subtitles need to be improved.Never had this many tears. Amazing series!,9
"This show was like a mixtape of other (and better) shows. You can virtually see the Netflix algorithm in action: ""The capitalism parable in Parasite won an Oscar, so let's go with that. And people responded really well to the colorful uniforms and weird masks in Casa de Papel, so let's give people a chance to dress up as our characters on Halloween which will give the show free PR. Oh, and Battle Royale was really successful and influential, so let's pretty much steal that whole concept right down to the classical music and cheery female speaker!""The VIPs get a lot of flak for their acting in many reviews on IMDb, and rightly so. But let's be honest, the Korean actors are no better. This show is filled to the brim with bad Asian style overacting, something which is far too common in Korean and Japanese shows. The bad guy with the face tattoo is right out of some school play, and the guy in the lead is pulling faces like a madman. I have no idea who they are but I wouldn't be surprised if they originally are comedians. The best actor in the whole show is the main character's daughter and she's only in it for a couple of minutes.As per usual for a Netflix production the story is stretched very thin in order to make it nine hours (!) long.",4
My first K Series ever and I was not disappointed. The story and acting were both amazing.,10
"Amazing acting by the main actors and side characters. VIPs were the only annoying part of the movie but they did their part. Music was a bit annoying at times but it gave a lot of it tension that was really needed in all of the ""games"". The ending is incredible and I don't think there should be a season 2. I would love to see more tho. I feel like they didn't really think the show itself is going to get really popular so they ended it right there.9/10 only thing that was bad were the VIPs. Would love to see more with the VIP plot etc.",7
"What an amazing series taking you on a roller coaster of emotions, we couldn't stop watching it. I agree with the other viewers that the VIP acting was rubbish but equally I think they are meant to represent caricatures of the most vile people who enjoy killing for sport. Wow the acting though from the Korean cast is first rate and the story line has a deeper message for all of us. Episode 6 had me wrecked!",10
Damn what I just watched. And.episode 6 just squeezed all the tears out from me.,10
"It's disturbing but all the more entertaining for it. I rarely watch series with a plot, let alone that fast (took me less than 4 days, which is super unusual for me). Read some reviews saying there was no character development but I will have to disagree. All major character change from ep 1 to their last respective scene. Some scenes were very emotional as well, ep 6 had me sobbing. The acting by the VIP's was a bit off-putting but ultimately didn't bother me as much. I loved the games too, being of Korean descent. Only the 5th game was somewhat out of order and dragged a bit. The additional storylines around the games made it even more real, somehow. There are some open ends which have me looking forward to the 2nd season.",10
"The survival game trope isn't usually my thing, but this one was actually done really well. The characters are complex with backstory so it's not just all about the games.I agree with everyone else about the VIPs. Prepare yourself for them and try to pretend they didn't happen. I can't wait for the day kdramas stop sticking random English speakers into their shows. They're always the worst actors and no matter how good the show and the Korean actors are, the English speakers always instantly make the scene cheesy and look and act like a fish out of water.To be fair I have spoken to a Korean friend who told me that due to the language barrier this awkward delivery isn't picked up on in Korea. But just a warning, the English speaking scenes in this show were the most cringy I've seen in any kdrama, both acting wise and writing too for some reason. The rest of the show was great.Otherwise, highly recommended. I loved the last episode, and it seems they left room for a possible season 2.",8
"We make poor choices in life. That's the truth. But we must learn from them.This show is about a man, Gi Hun, who isn't really down on his luck but more so just plain stupid. That's the first episode. Instead of buying a present for his daughter he chose to gamble away the money and if that couldn't get worse he doubles down.This show is like that, endless repetitive doubling down. Which makes it... nonsense. Completely.I'll explain why. From the get go, the audience (in this case, me) find it difficult if not impossible to root for Gi Hun because he actively and knowingly create situations where he will lose. He's gambling-addict I get that. But to take money from loansharks, then gamble that away and proceed to waive his physical rights (is that even legal) is whole another level of stupid. Fast forward little bit he meets a mysterious person working for the squid game in recruiting players, the man invites him to play a game where they will bet serious money (that Gi Hun does not have) and we find ourselves yet in another situation, Gi Hun gets completely slapped left and right because he cannot pay yet he continues to gamble and winning once, he is completely satiafied.Now we find ourselves in the squid game where players have a chance to win billions. But after the first game with hundreds of players die, they vote to end the game so no one gets anything and get to go home.This is where the internal logic of this show falls apart. Supposedly everyone is in it for the money and after going back to play again they are completely ready to die. Only they are not ready to die, they think that they have a better chance here than they do in real world.It gets worse, they are made to believe that the games are fair but they are not. As some of the players brought contraband, one player is the mastermind behind, and one player knows the next game.Only one person in that group gets punished, rest did not face any consequence.Fairness is thrown out the window.Rules are arbitrary (front man/vip shows his face but the rest cannot?)Sacrifices are made meaningless because it's either the person who sacrificed is alive, or the person who gets saved dies.One ordinary cop can get through security but the police has not caught a whiff of squid game?In the end this is just another death game show with poor worldbuilding. Poor choices.",6
Honestly I'm good reviewer.. this series is great go and watch.,10
"I think if I spoke Korean and could watch this without it being dubbed, I would probably love it and give it at least 9 starts. But the dubbing is bad and the dialogue is amateurish. I'm guessing they have to make the English words fit the time frame of the actor's mouths moving and maybe because of that it is not a direct translation and that is why it is often so bad. But beyond that, the voice actors doing the dubbing are often pretty flat in their delivery. So while this is an intriguing watch, it is marred by the voice actors doing the dubbing (and the writers who I think could have done better with the dialogue).",6
"I remember watching Korean films back in the day and they had .. something. These days it seems they copy American style with a bit of a twist, but still disappointing.In episode 4, they make a huge plot mistake which makes no sense (food, without spoiling too much).This show is like news media... using something to shock you, to get you to watch, but no quality or depth to it.",1
It used to make me cringe. But I'm not gonna watch this in the original language. English is already my second language. Hating substitles was the reason i learnt English before school to begin with.,5
"A very slow series, there are many much better Korean series/ films if you want to watch foreign films. Just don't bother with this one - the acting is poor, the dubbing is awful, and the ending is an absolute mess!",4
"Why giving rich people stupid ideas? Acting is so good, actors are very honest and Koreans are so beautiful, but the VIPs... it is so bad. Love for Wi Ha Jun.",7
"I don't usually review, but when I do, It is really really good.",10
"I really liked the show, the beginning for me PERSONALLY was just a bit boring but I clung on and was attached to the show by the end of it. If you have watched the show, you'll know about THAT episode and.. I was speechless and broken by the end of it and it was great, the actors were amazing at portraying all the emotions.The ""VIP's"" voice acting / acting were.. horrid HAHA it was so bad, I just couldn't help laughing. The ending was rough and messy and I wasn't a big fan of it especially how they forced hinted the second season :/Overall, I really recommend it, the show is great, the actors are awesome and you really feel the emotions and the vibes they emitted. It truly was a rollercoaster and I recommend this ride. Each episode leaves you wanting to watch the next.",8
"Let me keep it straight.Squid Game has a better cinematography (see the color contrast!!!) but Alice in the Borderland is way darker (n thus better, personally) as a thriller and horror series. I dunno why but Japanese directors are more capable of creating stunning gore effects and death/necro scenes. Which is to say, If u can't stand the horror and jump-scare of Alice in the Borderland, then Squid Game is the one more u. It is visually mild in every aspects, plus a warmer story to make u feel easier.Back to Squid Game, I think it's not something original and groundbreaking. As a survival horror series it is too warm, too humane. The baddies are not that bad (at all!!). Finally, why there is always a super clean-n-tidy, pale skin, ""handsome"", smart, literate, elite entrepreneur young prince???? Where is the alpha-male?????!!!!!!",6
"I heard so much hype for this so I was excited to watch. I did enjoy the first episodes a lot and was really positively surprised with diverse characters like Ali and Sae Byeok. I wish we got more depth to her and surely she would have had very interesting background/flashbacks. I wish there had been more winners honestly, cos i thought multiple winners were possible. The whole VIP rich guys pay to watch people die seemed quite predictable too. I never really found Gi-hun that relatable and wasnt much character growth. I really think Sae Byeok shouldnt have died - but survived and won the game for her brother and family. It was nice touch Gi-hun did keep his promise and gave her brother better life, but still. The end of him going back to the game is promising for S2, but cliche.",6
Im still thinking about it. Its freaking genius!!!,10
When I saw the preview it didn't look that interesting but when I was on TikTok there was a scene they were playing a game it was so crazy and I'm like wow I need to watch it so I'm already on episode 5. If you want to watch something would blow your mind this is it.,10
"This series is exceptional. It poses a narrative which delves into the human psyche. Themes of duality, choice, power and control are played out within the game. The series is analysing socio-political, gender and class binaries within stunning scenography, beautiful symbology and a compelling story line.I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Battle Royale, or Asian Tartan Extreme films.",10
"Squid game was really good, beyond my expactations. However, VIPs part and final was so cheesy! You shound watch behind the scenes video and see that most places, they were real!",8
Korea is turning to one best movie makers . What a fascinating serie.,8
"One of the well-made, and original shows. The highlights: its writing, creative direction, Large and beautiful set design, character developments, and an uncovering of the truth of Humanity. Though it is not for faint-hearted people as it is brutal and disturbing in many ways still A masterpiece that every movie premyy should watch. Highly Recommended! ?",10
This show is violent and there is a lot of death in it.But it is compelling and well shot.Don't speak Korean so I cannot comment on the translations or the voice acting of dub people.,8
Best show! The story is excruciating and the best one so far on my suspense k drama list. A must watch drama.,10
"Predictable and melodramatic to a fault. The treatment of the female characters was botched, the whole production felt unbelievably forced... And don't even get me started on the VIPs.",2
"The show is essentially a show that begins with a realistic interpretation of the psychological aspect of a ""battle royale"" life or death game where people are desperate and motivated by the insurmountable debt they have accumulated. It quickly throws this idea away half way through the show where the money doesn't matter, life is more important than money, and winning a life or death game with a ""good heart"" will show the true winner. This is the Asian concept that I put in my title that I thought was too melancholy for my taste and ruined the realism of peoples actual reaction to this type of turmoil.The first game in the first episode is a game of red light; green light, where if you are eliminated you are shot. Over 200 people die and they barely win a vote to get off the island because they did not expect the games to be this inhumane. This is a respectable understanding and it made sense for the story. But many of the people who voted to leave, found out that their debt back home was ruining their lives more than they remembered and choose to reenter into the games.This is where the show starts to get too stereotypical for me. The games don't matter because plot armor is already established and they instead treat the games like they are ""forced"" to be there and must win by being the most compassionate and caring of all the players. This makes no sense and is contradicting when they chose to be there not once but twice.All instances of life and death situation is thrown out the window and many pretend that everyone is of good nature and, ""we can win this with everyone still alive"". Then they turn one character into a psychopath because he did what he had to do while actually playing the games and then ACTUALLY turn him into a psychopath purely to make a ""final boss"" enemy in the show.I won't spoil everything in the show if you choose to watch it but they also have a lot of "" saw that coming"" and ""give me a break"" plot twists in the show that I thought were reminiscent of the Asian cinema stereotype and it kind of ruined the show for me. But the show deserved at least a 5 or 6 at the least. But knowing Netflix, they will make a second season off of this because of its popularity when its not needed and ruin the entire story line even further.",5
"This is my first time writing a review on Imdb and i am only doing this because of this series.I have to say that it's one of the best series Netflix has brought to us so far. If i ever had the ability to forget everything and rewatch it, i would have done it.A really exciting and dramatic series at the same time. It almost made me cry at some point.",10
I would never thought that a show could blow my mind that much its really deep and also very dark i recommend it for everyone with a strong mind. One of the best shows ever.,10
"It is the first Korean TV series I watched. I found it very interesting, with fast action. It also gives you food for thought. Unlike series of similar cases, it has the main difference that the players are there voluntarily. This creates different dynamics and plot. Watching the first 6 episodes I was excited. From the 7th episode until the end, there was no surprise and everything was predictable.The explanation of why all this happened,was just what was expected. The story with the policeman and his brother, did not finally seem to have special meaning. The ""plot twist"" with the old man, was not a plot twist at all, if you have watched ""Saw' 1 & 2 and many of the thrillers that followed it. Perfect up to a point, but without a climax. This could have been a 10 but..",7
"I really wish at the end, the frontman was just Mr Beast. Seems like something he would do just to mix it up a bit.All seriousness aside, this is a real thrill ride with some absolutely brutal moments and really shows the lengths people go to stay alive. Greed, guilt, remorse, relief and anger are just a handful of the emotions shown by the cast.Very thought provoking and would highly recommend to anyone.",9
Super good cant believe this was based on a true story. We have to stop them.,10
"Awesome.VIPs tho, so dumb. Horrible voices, line delivery, and acting. Would have been better if they said nothing at all. It was like they were all doing bugs bunny impersonations. Horrible.",8
"*light spoilers of plot details*Squid Game is a story about a large group of deeply indebted Korean citizens who willingly take part in a deadly game in the hopes of taking away a massive cash prize at the expense of the other participants' lives.Now, that's all well and good. Who doesn't love a good show of violence and human selfishness? There are many great character moments in this series, moments of shameless manipulation, hopefuly naïvety, and self deception. However, this story paints the lives of the participants in a way that is often boring, uninteresting, and downright unbelievable. Honestly, none of the characters act like real people, and there are several GLARING plot holes and nonsensical plot points to boot; for example, 456 people go missing at the exact same time, staying missing for three days, 255 of them NEVER RETURNED, and absolutely nobody, anywhere, seems to notice this insane phenomenon that would've made international headlines in the real world. I mentioned this to a friend, and he pointed out a detail that I missed: these games have been going on FOR YEARS. How have several mass kidnappings, involving hundreds of people disappearing in a single day, remain completely unnoticed by anybody? Wouldn't the police be taking missing person reports more seriously by now? How... that's it, just how. How? How. Any of this, all of this, just how.But, don't worry, because our main character, the very sane man that he is, goes to the police! Good boy, maybe we can do something about this mass murder! However, none of the officers take him seriously. So, what's his next move? Go to a different police station? Call a news outlet? Nope. Our hero gave up right then and there. Didn't even write a blog about the horror show he was subject to, he just fully gave up because the police were mean to him. He saw more than 200 people shot to death in a goofy red light green light death game, almost died himself, and this is the best he can do to for all those dead people. I suppose we have to assume that nobody else went to the police, and if they did, they were also laughed into complete silence. All I can say is... how? How. The only police officer who did half of his job was a detective who overheard our main character, and only because his brother is one of the people who went missing, decides to investigate it OFF THE BOOKS, conveniently informing noone of his investigation or wherabouts. First of all, the fact that he's only investigating this because his brother is missing is mind blowingly selfish. Second of all, WHY DIDN'T HE WRITE ANY OF THIS DOWN? Is this guy even a real cop, or is he just role playing? HOW IS ANY OF THIS HAPPENING THE WAY IT'S HAPPENING? HOW DID NOBODY NOTICE THAT 456 PEOPLE WERE MISSING FOR 3 DAYS, AND 255 OF THEM NEVER RETURNED? Honestly, once the detective character goes all Solid Snake and hops on the bad guy boat, not making any calls to his unit, with nothing but a pistol and a cell phone, you have to wonder ""How bad are things in South Korea right now?"" It must be damn near post apocalyptic over there for this groundbreaking case to be in the hands of a madman who probably isn't actual law enforcement.Speaking of the plot, I couldn't write about this show without discussing the insane premise that it relies upon: all of our main characters decided to take part in a game that would kill all but one of them. All participants are made aware of this fact, and surely realize the simple reality that they and everyone they met during the first game have virtually no chance of survival, yet nobody acts as if this is the case. Only 3% of the people who were unknowingly thrust into a lethal game and witnessed 255 people killed before their very eyes decided that their lives weren't bad enough to warrant throwing them away in a game that only one person could survive. Not even gonna ask how on that one, I'm just gonna call bulls**t. Everyone with a family and loved ones, everyone who voted to end the games after the first session of bloody horror, all of them determined that they, in fact, had no reason to live OR were going to die anyway, and every last one of them decided that the only chance they had at a normal life was to give the murder games another shot. Who cares about the odds, amiright? Furthermore, our beloved main characters, all stupid enough to enter this lethal lottery, continue to develop friendships between and during each murder game, forever in denial of the fact that they will die. I don't understand how any of these people, excluding the actual psychopaths, can rationalize reentering the game. Sure, maybe they didn't even consider the odds, maybe all of these degenerate gamblers are so stupid and so arrogant that they all believe they will be the sole victor. Why not. However, that hardly explains why a married couple entered the games, knowing for a fact that AT LEAST one of them would die, and the husband had the imbecilic audacity to get upset when his wife died. What did you think was going to happen? I knew what was going to happen, and we both have the same information, so why didn't you know what was going to happen? I found myself frequently asking my television this question during my initial viewing of this series.There are too many impossibly irrational character choices in this show to list, and far too many for a critical viewer to ignore. Without reasonable people or a remotely well thought-out story, it's damn near impossible to suspend my disbelief. I watched it anyway, just to see how much further down the plot hole-hole it could go, and thought ut technically could have been worse, the story would have had to change my life to counteract the inexcusable implausibility. By the way, the last episode is aost unwatchably dull and features two very different yet equally flacid plot twists. Also, the first two games are the only decent ones, and they all kinda suck after that.Really quick, before I wrap this up, let's do a plot hole/stupid character choices lightning round: having the elderly founder participate in the games, including several physically demanding ones like tug of war, is an impossibly stupid gamble; metal detectors exist, the squid games facility might consider trying them; the rules of every game arbitrarily change in favor of the plot; tempered glass refracts light differently than normal glass, such that just about anybody could see the difference; Gi-hun's gambling debt put him is such a dangerous situation with loan sharks, yet he was able to survive for years without touching his money. I'm getting tired at this point, so I'll just leave it at that.If you don't give a good god damn about attention to detail, and you like a mediocre, violent spectacle that comes to a grinding hault for frequent and irritating character drama, this might just be the series for you. Also, the production design was actually quite fascinating, so if that's something that interests you, watch an episode or two.",6
"The show is a bit overhyped but it has its reasons. It was good for a long while until the very end.I like the show from start til episode 8.The last episode felt like it ruined the good things in the show. I wouldn't discount the good story but I still cant get over what happened in the end. Is it just to have a second season? I wish it could have been done differently though. I would much rather have a good happy ending where he just lives normally with his daughter and adopt Sae-Byeok's brother not just leave money for an old woman to take care of.The show isncalled squid game but the final game didnt really justify squid game properly as they both end up fighting for survival. I mean at least make the series reasonable with its title. We spend so much minutes on ther challenges and we could barely get 30 minutes on squid game.He could have straightened his life instead of going after the squid game organizers.Also what happened to the cop? There was no definitive ending for him. Was he really dead? Was was there no closure for him and his brother?But I wouldnt discount the good plot. Overall I like the story. It is really good and the characters really showed passion in their work. There were some hit and miss especially when the vips came to the scene, they have the worse acting.Overall, This is still a great series just really cant get over the final episode.",6
"This is a must-watch series . It's very unique and it had me at the edge of my bed right throughout the season. The ending was not expected, but it was very interesting and I can't wait for season 2.",10
"Great series, but I agree with most other reviews. The VIPS were ridiculous.",8
"I have never seen a ""last man standing gets the money"" movie/series that pulled me in as much as this did. I was at the edge of my seat the entire time. (Not just because I had to read the subtitles) the raw emotion and human spirit that was shown throughout, and especially at the very end by the main character, was emotionally moving, to say the least. The mental and emotional damage shown by the players towards throughout felt so genuine. You found yourself cheering for the characters, only to be hit by the gravity of what is to happen after. They say money doesn't buy happiness, I disagree to an extent. Money would solve all of my depression right now. I have a happy marriage with a lovely wife, a beautiful son, and a decent house. However, we are so in debt due to NICU bills and other debts, and are about to lose our home. I have been thrown so low to the point of some of these characters, and I could relate to them. Would I be a part of Squid Game? Definitely not. I have too much to lose. Beautiful, yet sobering series.",10
I loved this show for many reasons. The story was great I loved the concept and characters. The violence and gore was great too. The downfall is the bad acting at times it's kinda laughable bad. Overall a great surprise and I want more seasons even if it's with a new cast. I want more !!!,7
Gi-Hun is played by Lee Jung-Jae not my Greg Chun.Kindly edit the cast.,9
I really enjoyed this show and can't wait for a second season.I really liked the characters and became invested in them.A few things I didn't like was I wished they focused more on the games. A lot of the episodes focused on the characters.I also wish the main character put his daughter first. That was a bit annoying to see because I like his character.I still don't understand the point of the games and offering the money. I wish it had been explained better. Seemed like they tried to and I still don't get it.But other than those things it was enjoyable and very unique. I was on the edge of my seat so many times and I had to remind myself it's only tv.There are a few twists in it too if you like twists like I do.Highly recommend it.,8
I haven't enjoyed a first season like this since Westworld and can't recommend this enough. Was a little bit jarring at first but really merged a lot of genres that had never been done before and knocked it out of the ballpark. A+,10
"""Squid Game"" is definitely a slow burn in its first 2 episodes (but they do give you a taste of what's to come). As for the rest of the season, you probably won't be able to stop watching thanks to its story, characters, thrills, twists, games and, of course, gore.",10
"Sure, it's a complete rip-off of a Japanese classic movie but it's still one of the most imaginative and visually stunning shows this year.Love it.Watch it!",10
"Great acting, heart and soul, lots of action and hard decision making. A tad slow at first, but after ep 2, I couldn't look away. At times I wanted to but I just couldn't. Definitely recommend.",10
"I watched this show in the original language of Korean with English subtitles.I'm writing this review after watching the first seven shows, because it's very interesting. One big thing I like in shows is morality. Everyone has morals, and they differ in each individual. I enjoy Star Trek because of the focus on morals. Same thing with The Orville. This show is no exception.One important thing regarding morality is that every single character is there by their own free will and choice. This is important, even though the creators of the games didn't give any details as to what the games would be.Spoilers: The first game involved a deadly game of Red Light, Green Light. Unlike the original game, players caught moving on a red light were shot. The creators used technology to detect movement. Upon realizing the deadly aspect, most players panicked and tried to leave but ended up shot due to being caught moving.What got the players to come was potential prize money. Each eliminated player added money to the pot.After the first game, some players remaining didn't want to continue, even after seeing the amount of prize money they were playing for. Players signed a contract involving three clauses, one of which was the games would stop if the majority wanted to stop. Therefore, the game's creators put it to a vote. They barely reached a majority, the games ended, and they dropped off the remaining players in different locations.However, the games would continue if the majority of the players returned. The game's creators enticed players to return and, eventually, all but about 10 to 20 people came back.I don't want to get too detailed regarding the plot, but the point of this review is the morals. My thinking changed during the course of the show.While watching the first game, I'm thinking that I would be playing very carefully after watching the first person getting shot, so I wouldn't die. I'm hoping I wouldn't get too scared and freeze completely.For the second game, I don't know if I would have passed. I might be too scared to try, or I would be too careful and run out of time. Each game had a time limit, and they shot any remaining players that didn't complete it.For the third game and even during the riot, I didn't think about what I would do in their situation. I probably would have tried to find some place to hide to avoid others from attacking.For game four, this opens so many possibilities. Would I sacrifice myself for the other to move on, or would I sincerely try to beat the other? What game would I choose? Of course, it would depend on who my partner was. Also, would I to trick the other, so I would survive and move on? I probably wouldn't be able to live with that guilt for the rest of my life.One character went against his wife and couldn't get over the fact that he won. He wanted to end the games and tried to get players to join him. One character pointed out that ending the game would make his wife's sacrifice pointless. I was thinking along those lines, too.For game five, the first thing I would do is try to tell the difference between the two glass panes. One of the later players ended up doing that. The host turned out the lights to remove the advantage.Many players during game five got scared and hesitated regarding deciding which glass pane to choose. It was a 50/50 shot, and the player would fall to their death if wrong. There was a time limit involved. When one player sat on one of the glass panes and started praying, I got the feeling that the player behind should push him.In summary, this show got my attention and my interest. I was even cheering for some of the characters, and I disliked a couple. The morality aspect is the most interesting part of the game, and the show even surprised me on more than one occasion. The show isn't for everyone due to gore, profanity, some suggestive dialogue, one somewhat detailed sex scene, another scene where a guy tries to get another guy to go down on him, and one scene where naked women appear as furniture.",8
It's simply one of the best thriller series I've ever seen. I'm starting to dig in the Korean TV series to find sth similar.,9
"I really loved the show, it was absolutely nerve wrecking and kept me at the edge of my seat most of the time. Plot wise and cast wise its all good. I didn't really like the ending, i felt it was rushed a bit. As for the VIPs i really hated how they were portrayed. They're supposed to be the main reason for running the game but they're a bunch of old ridiculous perverts. This really annoyed me. Apart from this, i enjoyed it alot, waiting for season 2.",8
"Take Battle Royale, Alice in Borderland, and Ultimate Survivor Kaiji - put them in a blender with all the best parts of each - BOOM you get Squid Game. Incredible plot, great acting (yea the English VIPs were awful, but not enough to the people who are complaining about them in reviews), and the intensity...wonderful series.",10
"Squid Game is another bullet in the chamber against streaming television.What other, also terrible films (""would you rather"" immediately comes to mind) have managed to do in 2 hours, Squid Game takes 9 to draw the same conclusion: people suck when money is involved.Hundreds of people down on their luck agree to take part in a series of games with an unannounced prize fee. After a few hundred are shot down in a game of ""red light, green light"" they get told every life is worth quite a lot of cash. Gi-Hun, Sang,Wool and Sa-Beok are our eyes as they go through the tortures and trials of the whims of the rich, hounded by the poor.Nothing here is new. The twists have all been done, the characters are all so broadly drawn that their motivations are unreasonable except in service of a story. The conclusions, as to why they're playing children's games, and why it's all happening, might offer some comfort, but it's all nonsensical. Scenes that could have given understanding to why one manipulative shrew eventually sacrifices herself and another for the good of the survivors would have been favourable to repeat scenes of endless people in tracksuits walking up and down stairs. Giving us a true villain in the game with a counter POV for the final games would have set up a much better war of ideologies in an uncaring society than two sides of the same coin and an emotional bond that had been severed several episodes previously. Having an omniscient operator accuse a player of cheating and ruining the ""equality"" of the game is laughable, when you consider the same faceless man does everything in his power to handicap adept players, and ensure as many people as possible die in unfair circumstances as possible.The Korean actors are all swell, but it's so difficult to comprehend how they chose the foreigners who appear in the final few episodes. They sound like they're badly dubbed, and even though they wear masks, their performances are stiff as the gold encrusted animals they wear.Skip over this. Netflix needs to stop financing every poorly thought out idea they land on, and begin considering quality over content.",2
"Standard down on their luck beginning of characters, then the storyline quickly goes into overdrive with many social mores broken.I guessed the ending but the reason I don't give this 10/10 is the last episode is somewhat muddled. The angst and actions of the main character is weakly explained.",9
"I rarely write reviews but this show is bingeworthy, it gots me laughing, crying at the same times and the color of the movie, those actors' acting skills were heart-touching, spectacular I must say. I guess I was a bit confused due to the last episode but to dig deep down inside the main character, he has a really warm heart from the moment that he fed a cat to the moment that he stop the game for his friend, so I guess it has never been easy for him to use that money immidiately. And after seeing the death of 455 players, it is understandable why he didn't choose to break his daughter's new family in LA (which can be considered as paradise) but come back to Hell Joseon as a new human-being (when ppl change their hair color, it means that they want to be a new them) to maybe get revenge for his friend or change the whole system of the game ^^? Can't wait to know what will happen next so please release season 2 the sooner the better!!!!",10
There are a bunch of much older Japanese dramas & films of this genre (survival games) that are far superior but less popular. Talk about marketing and promotion...,4
I loved most of the series but I think the end of this first season made no sense. Why the red hair color? He wanted the money to be a good father but when he won it feels like he completely forgot about his daughter... I really disliked the way the handle the end.,6
"The acting in Squid Game is phenomenal. I've seen so many negative reviews based on the acting of the VIPS - in which you BARELY even see. It's the typical rich people acting - is it worth an Oscar... no, but the acting from the Korean cast is worthy of awards no doubt.Squid Game is a fun, fast paced ride I would take again. Highly recommend!",10
If you are looking for a show with amazing performers (except the vip) then you need to watch squid game. Episode 6 is heart breaking. A tv show has yet to make me cry yet this one did. If I could give another standing ovation then I would.,10
"Koreans now to the Emmy awards. Great, surprising.But ending is disappointing. Maybe It's because of there's another season ..",9
"If you like Battle Royale, The Prisoner, Hunger Games and a good drama - this is for you.Set in South Korea in the present day, this series is a stark look at what people will do when society has failed them - richly character driven and with a wonderfully original take on the sinister, this is a Netflix series that has depth, drama, entertainment and shock-value.It's a not afraid to be a slow burner at times, but the mystery and slight surrealist nature of 'The Game' drives your attention throughout.It's worth watching and taking time over. Really recommended.",9
"I loved it. Right up to the vips, which were pathetic, however didn't ruin the show too much.Well worth the binge on a Saturday night.",10
"We've seen every element of this before. My wife and I sat here predicting how every single scene would play out. The acting, while carried by a few good performances, was uninspiring and the lack of character development made it hard to care for the fates of anyone in the show. More enjoyment came from retranslating the poor subtitles than actually following the story.",3
"A Korean series that shows a group of people who are put in a deadly game for money until one wins and manages to survive. We saw the story before but it has moments that are captivating, the message of social criticism is interesting. Obviously it's not perfect there are script conveniences, moments when the story is unnecessarily slowed down. It's worth it anyway.",6
"Squid Game is a nicely made series with decent acting and they clearly had a decent budget. Episode 1 peaks your interest and then episode 2 just draws it out and we all know what is inevitably going to happen, you can basically skip that episode. From 3 onwards is good and keeps the interest. Episode 6 was my favourite. Episode 7 onwards with the VIP's becomes annoying because they serve no real interesting aspect to the story. I feel that the ""twist"" ending was predictable as I'd thought about it prior, but it still serves purpose to the narrative.A couple of reasons why I'm only giving it a 6 is because it becomes less about the games and it encourages murder between the players. This contradicts the rules it had threatened players with prior, where no player can disadvantage the participation and/or rights of other players. I also felt the ""intruder"" role became monotonous and the climax unsatisfying with many questions left pondering. I also found the death of Sae-byeok to be a let down as I believed she deserved a better ending.Overall, worth checking out for the story, acting and questions it leaves the viewer about their own circumstances.P. S. Would you play?",7
"What about the first 200+ casualities on the first game who didn't know they were going to die if they participate? I think the old man was kind of an ass and wasn't really a chaotic neutral character they tried to portray him to be at the end.Overall, good show.",8
Znnznznznznnsnsnsnsnsnnsnsnsnsnsnsnsnsnsnsnsnsnnsnznsnsnznsmz.,10
"I watched the movie because I heard from my friend this movie was good. When I watched this movie for the first time, I really liked the story line. It makes me curious. I watched episode 1 - 9 in one night.",9
"This tv series is so entertaining. I couldn't switch it off, it hit every emotion from shock, tears and wow.A must watch if like gripping tv shows.",10
"The first episodes were definitely hooking and story and characters were well built and interesting. But the second half got really boring and predictable. Full of of really stupid situations, non-logical story telling and absolute non-sense actions of many characters which kind of ruined it. Also, the open ending for second season...? Just finished it because...But many times, I was just in mood to turn it off...",6
"The plot:10/10
Characters: 10/10. Cast:10/10
Everything was amazing. It is pretty short but a lot happened. Its a rollercoaster of emotions. Definitely recommend.",10
"A pretty gripping show that has 7 solid episodes.Sadly it has one filler episode and falls apart a bit at the end, but for the most part it's a season that you can't stop watching.Definitely worth a watch and am recommending to my friends.Don't think it needs a second season but I imagine one will be made.",7
It's a lame ending to a good show. Kind of ruins it.,8
"Perfect to binge watching, this series holds a gripping premise into a stunningly crafted, twisty plot full of turns and jaw dropping moments. While not really perfect, this is a perfectly fine Netflix entertainment. Totally recommended!",8
First going into this I was hesitant it seemed like a typical portrayal of an indebted person doing anything to be free however it just kept getting better each episode. Every character was very important to how the story progresses and the acting was phenomenal expect for when the VIPs arrived. I really hope they decide to continue the show for a second season.,10
"A likely tale based on real life experiences. The elites (VIPs) participate in these types of twisted events. ""The Most Dangerous Game"" ""The Game."" Did you notice many of the movie's scenes resembled kill rooms similar to those leaked during Clinton and Podesta's #pizzagate? So ask yourself, why this soft disclosure movie full of kids' games, toys, color, and imagery? What kind of people are REALLY directing ""The Game"" and who are the INNOCENTS forced to play? This series is once again attempting to disclose the same sickness Kubrick did and was killed for in ""Eyes Wide Shut""!",8
The dose of enthusiasm and suspense is very beautiful .. but the end was supposed to be more beautiful.,9
"I see a lot of shows like this that start with a good idea but often fizzle out by resorting to common dystopian clichés like forgettable actors and leads, predictable plot lines and character choices, and the like.I was pleasantly surprised by Squid Game! It engages lots of different subplots in addition to the main game, and manages to make each one very invested and entertaining. If you're someone who wants some fresh takes on the thriller/dystopian scene, pick this show! It'll keep you gripping your seat, theorizing with your friends about who will live and who will die, in and out of the game itself. I had so much fun with this show and recommend it to any group of morbidly curious friends.",9
"Intense. Massively intense!!!Games. Choices. Money. Decision.Oh what a twist! Salute to the Scriptwriter and Director, Hwang Dong-hyuk!Cheers to all the actors! It made me scream and cry!9.5/10#SquidGame.",9
"Only 6 or 7 episodes worth of material stretched to 9.The American dialogue is pure shallow stereotype trash compared to the Korean's. You could still make them bad, but given them decent lines. Even the worst Korean parts had meaningful dialogue and had some sympathetic qualities.The script played a decent 8 and 2/3's innings. The last out could have gone for the fences, but instead was a meaningless 3rd strike check swing.",7
"There's something about Korean shows on Netflix always hitting the gold spot. Furthermore, so excited for another season.",10
"I came into this with high hopes being a fan of Korean and Asian cinema and was not disappointed. I wouldn't honestly put this up there with Train To Busan - it had the same level of character development - you genuinely care what happens to these characters. It also has a battle royale meets would you rather meets hostel vibe. Just don't watch it dubbed, stick with the original Korean and subtitles.",10
"The show made me cringe on so many levels and so many times. I feel like I've seen that show many times already and the characters as well as the actors behind we're subpar, typical and very predictive.Doing a show around this kind of concept where humans are subjected to man-made situations of violence and survival, similar to hunger games, is attractive to viewers, for some reason, and it was to be expected that there'd be weird explanations on why this kind of situation even takes place. So for this part I don't blame them.What disappointed me was the VERY poor characters, their development and interactions between them. Some characters, like the bully who led it's mean boys clan, or the girl who didn't name or child and ended up with the bully, only to get ditched by him, wow that was bad acting.I know people will still be entertained by it, I just wish they'd put some more giving this kind of show more personality than the stereotypical good guy, bad guy, etc.",5
"Here is why we wanted to say about Squid Game. I miss movies and shows like this. We haven't had anything similar for awhile. I thought the character development was top notch. I seriously cared about 8 characters. This made it fun because I had no idea who would die or win. All of the characters are flawed. There wasn't a typical hero or someone you really hated and I loved that. The acting was really really good for several characters. The directing and writing was really good. It was exciting and fun with lots of twists and turns. The concept was pretty cool and you could do sequels and it would be just as fun as long as you can find more actors as great as these. If you enjoyed the Hunger Games you will probably really like this series. My husband said it was a cross between Saw, Hunger Games and the minions (only for the outfits). I haven't seen Saw and don't like torture, but I enjoyed this. However, if you are not cool with lots of people dying you might think it's too much. Also, we all binged the season in two days and are still like wait a minute? I was thinking about this and wow, is this what really happened? Enjoy!",10
"Curiosity got me and I started watching it. I found it thoughtful, it gave me another perspective of nowadays society. It's absolutely worth watching it, better than many other series now on Netflix. If you watched ""The Platform"" (Netflix), you will find it amazing for you.",9
"Even though I have Netflix, I only watch when I see a trailer on a social media platform I use. What got me hooked was the simple fact when granny used her bank pin as her grand daughter's birthday, I KNEW I HAD to watch. 6.8 baby here & plus I'm part Korean.",7
Behad bakwas..kaun de raha 8.5 isko?Such a dumb & predictable story & such a drag.Too much filmy nonsense & it drags n drags n drags. Such likeable actors but such a dumb story that you don't even want to knw how it ends & actually you won't miss much coz ending sucks too. Bhai kya bawaseer tha ye..isse achha toh tara Mehta dekh lo.,1
A dangerous man? Great idea. But the VIPs are very poor characters.,9
"Complete garbage soap, shallow and vapid characters, interactions, dialogue, garbage cinematography and picture quality, godawful choreography and camerawork. Scenes and setting both looking like haphazard trash, while also being excessively extended and serving no purpose at all. The show simply capitalizes on vulgarity and shock factor to attract lowbrow audiences.",1
"Seriously this show was like watching an anime. I saw that the director did name a couple of mangas that inspired him but I was shocked this wasn't based of a manga by the same name and story. Really addicting to watch. I see all the other reviews on here dumping on the VIP's but I'll add this... While the acting was atrocious, you're not supposed to like them. In this day in age, villains are always sexy/relatable. I choose to believe the terrible acting helps break the illusion of a ""bad ass"" or a ""sexy villain"". So maybe you can see it that way as well. I have a bigger gripe with...
and I'll spoiler mark this*Spoiler****
-that one VIP got held at gun point and knocked out but he didn't even so much as complain about it to frontman.. TF? At least mention it. I was left hanging there like... So he's cool with that happening to him even though he's ""hard to satisfy"" and was attempting to be this bad dude with impossibly high standards? But that's my only gripe so I still give it a 10!",10
"I continue to be impressed by Korean shows and movies. I really love them. This is a great show that I hope will go on. The characters are excellent, the games are anxiety-inducing and scary, and will have you dying to see what's next, and actual character development takes place throughout. I felt so many emotions watching this; I was moved. One of the biggest highlights for me was the relationship between Gi-hun and Sang-woo. The tension was built up over time and subtlety at first, and the story as a whole was done nicely. I also really liked the undercover cop/brother of the Frontman, and was heartbroken when his story ended the way it did. Everything he did was to find his brother, and what happened to him really made you disgusted with the Frontman and the whole organization.I thought the Tug-of-War challenge was the most disturbing one. To think about how it would feel standing at one side of the rope knowing you have to yank a group of people to their death so it's not done to you makes me wince.If I had to add some critique, I would agree with other reviews about the VIPs. Their acting was horrible and did not fit in with the rest of the show. But they just weren't a big enough element to really affect my rating.",10
STRONG start! It gets its tentacles wrapped around you and slowly looses its grip midway without taking a big enough bite of your brain to leave a lasting impression. I think they tried to cram too much while also slowing the pace down. I felt the marble episode was the turning point. It really dragged its feet even tho it introduced so much more story. Had they trimmed the fat and maybe kept it to only a few episodes it could have been great but ultimately it more sinks than swims by the end.,5
"It's nothing but something that kids who love playing gore-type, violent video games. No interesting story, just boring predictable scenes. Bad acting, cinematography is a joke. Watch it and you'll easily forget it in few seconds after.",1
"Spoilers (sort of?)The reason I gave this a star down is purely the fact that all the good hearted people dying got me so depressed. However, I should have expected that. But aside from that everything was amazing! The story line stays entertaining throughout the whole season and only gets better. I'd watched this a thousand times over.",9
"First, I will start by saying; this is NOT an original idea. It's been done dozens of times, especially in movies. Most recently The Hunt comes to mind, and I think I enjoyed that more.This was not a bad show, in fact the first episode really drew me in. Then they lost me with the next few episodes, but got back on track with the very strong episode 6. That's where they hit their stride.This show would have benefited greatly by making it 6 episodes instead of 9. It would have cut out all the superfluous story lines, like the organ harvesting, and based on the final episode, the whole Detective story line.I think if they just focused on the games and the people playing them (like episode 6), it would have solved some of the issues. I mean 6 games, 6 episodes. Makes sense.Oh, and I get that all of us Americans are fat, white, capitalist pigs, blah, blah, blah, but that hurt the story more than helped it. I wasn't offended by it, I just felt it didn't serve the story or stay authentic.I HATE watching dubbed, so I always watch subtitles, and it was just weird when all of a sudden everyone was speaking English. And yeah. I think they threw a Chinese guy and Russian guy into the VIP mix, but it just felt off.Then, the elephant in the final episode (not literally). But the ending. As someone who has dabbled in screenwriting, I had a feeling something was up with the old guy from the start. 001. Hmm? And then when you don't actually see him get shot I was like, yup, he's behind it. That's a fine ""twist"", but my God, his ""explanation"" was awful. And the fact he entered the game and wasn't killed by anyone or anything felt kind of far fetched. It's the kind of twist I felt like they came up with at the last minute.Then the whole Front Man/ Cop brother thing I saw coming too. But I wish I didn't as there was no resolution on it. Yeah, season 2 etc, but there should have been something that showed he was alive or something. I wasn't feeling that.And actually, the twist with the old man (for most people) was probably a major reveal and I felt like it could have been so much more dramatic or a much bigger reveal somehow as opposed Gi Hun just being like you're a bad man. And then they bet again and the old man dies happy because he made a friend and whatever? And that was the catalyst for Gi Hun to get a makeover to go to LA and go on RuPauls Darg Race, I mean finally do the right thing and go see his daughter? Which wasn't that his motivating factor all along? And then he just bails and is like, No. Katniss needs me as tribute and I'm going back to the Hunt to Survive the Game of the Hard Target Hunger Games Battle Royale style.And it kind of annoyed me at the end the card slap clip thing guy recognized Korean Annie Lennox from across the platform, hair color change and all, and just HAPPENED to be a train there for him to ""escape"" on. I guess that's another thing, just too much convince for the sake of plot. Like the guy being an expert at glass, or none of the guards noticed the one woman had to lighter to melt the Honeycomb?Also, what happened to the whole bit about the Morse code through cough? Was that just supposed to be the was 28 and 29 committed?And when the cop came in and was like, oh yeah, what was I doing yesterday? And the people jist answer him without being WTF?And last thing for me that kept it from getting a higher score, the ""rules"" kept seeming to change, depending on the episode and circumstances. I wasn't a huge fan of that.All in all, it was good, but could have been great.",6
"(Contains mild spoiler)
What an amazing show! Korean drama of this type is so different and well done. So unique in every element - the set, filmography, costumes, plot, acting, emotion - all was just to the point.Aesthetic in a creepy way, emotional (I got all teary on the Gganbu episode), it also had so many life lessons that touched on so many aspects of life. The players there got me thinking about the fine line between good and bad. Another thing is that in comparison to the other actors, VIPs seemed to be more relaxed and preposterous as I was expecting them to be scary and serious. But that's the charm, I guess no one will be expecting those VIPs to be some old bored rich bummers.Adults playing kids games with their life at stake. Despite all those horrors that were shown in this drama, the rewatch value is 10 on 10.1 star down cause it didn't answer all the questions and I hope there will be a second season that I'll be waiting for.",9
"The overall series is very accurate and interesting will make your interest on high octane edge. The actors have done a brilliant job, Character developments are also so impressive and fantastic. The makers should need to season 2 as soon as possible because It's been a long time since I've seen something new. Therefore, it should be taken forward.",9
"Really interesting and different. Definitely binge worthy.Characters were well played and acted. Managed to keep tension throughout.I felt that the addition of the VIPs didn't lend anything to the story line, however I am hoping in series 2 that this will be explored more.",10
"Having watched all the episodes in a few days this was very enjoyable. Despite the games could've been a whole lot better (Takeshis castle type?) this had likeable and hateable characters to run through the story, some bits were slow paced and certain elements shouldn't have been there and used as a time filler but all in all was very enjoyable esp episode 6. Wish more stuff like this.",8
"So good to see a truly entertaining TV show for a change, enjoyed every single episode, a big round of applause for Korean entertainment. And don't worry about the bad VIPs, they're not in it for long and the masks are beautiful.",9
"Every actor is fantastic performance
Great story great direction all best.",9
"It would probably be more thought-provoking if it weren't for the glaring errors.Also, it proved to be rather something of a bait and switch. First, they say it's all about pulling oneself up by one's bootstraps but it turns out to be something quite different. Everyday, vulgar banality is all it was, after all.",7
"It doesn't appeal at first, but if you you'll stay tuned, you'll see a really good drama series with some very well written characters.Watch it!",9
The production was done quite well. Love the direction. Cinematography was on point. Actors did a good job. That being said the story really starts to take a turn for the worst towards the end. Branched storylines resulted in dead ends. The failed attempt at trying to be artistic and deep was quite cringe worthy in the finale. Would i watch S2? 50/50.,6
"Good idea for a show but poor execution of it, totally overrated.",7
"This serie could be on the top so many years.Variety of games, colors, act, scenes, suspense and even reality, who knows? Jaja.Great 1st episope at the half of it starts the action
2nd one was like... oh no are they gonna leave the games??Later on the games are spot on and the only downside is the end. Although we know for sure it will be 2nd season.Just waiting for that.",9
I caught this on Netflix and it was a phenomenal series! I wasn't even sure I would like it but I ended up loving it! This is a creative storyline that gets pretty twisted but they were still able to add in some real sentimental parts that were surprising. Also has some mind blowing twists in it. Be prepared episode 6 is a rough one. I couldn't believe how much you end up liking certain characters so when those certain ones were eliminated it gets really upsetting.This ended where they could do another season so I looked it up to see if there were plans for it but there isn't yet. I read the director actually wrote every episode himself on top of directing it. He said if he does do another season he would use a writers table asks other seasoned directors.Do not miss out on this series!,10
"Terrible performances from the VIPs, but not enough to ruin that fantastic tv series. This is marathon worthy: I couldn't stop watching until the end. More than the sick games, the mistery behind the main plot was engaging and the end was surprising.",9
"Best Series I have Ever watched my whole life. I DONT think that I will ever watch a series so bingeworthy , so fun , so exciting ...
Just Amazing.",10
The first half of the first episode might be a little boring vut the rest of the show is perfect. I couldn't stop watching till the very last minute. It's a MUST watch.,10
"Had no idea what I was going in to, came out of some episodes with tears in my eyes.",8
"Very original, very strange. I like strange. Ooh look at this, it is so cute and harmless like a puppy until it bites off your index finger.",10
"So, I just finished watching the Squid Game and I have some contradictory feelings about it. For instance, some episodes get my heart racing. They're so good that you cannot look away from the screen and you start sweating in weird places!!! Then some episodes do very little character development, there is very little drama, there is very little addition to the whole series.Another thing that I think could've been improved (and maybe should be - if there is to be a second season) is that a lot of times there are enough clues in an episode where you can guess the exactly what is going on. The fact that doesn't ruin the show, must tell you how great it is. But, if you're looking for a big mystery, maybe this isn't your show, because you'll be able to guess what the heck is going on after just a few episodes.",9
"It was a very good series, I really enjoyed it! I do like this type of genre so I was looking forward to watch it! I think that the plot was entertaining and I also think that the series took inspiration from different popular series such as Money Heist (the guys wearing red suits) or Star Wars (the guy wearing the black mask looked like Darth Vader) or even the typical play station logo with all the basic geometric shape, which I didn't mind. I also noticed that the series is pretty similar to Hunger Games and Alice in Borderland on different aspects but I still find it unique and interesting. I didn't mind the VIP acting tbh, I've seen worse and that was ok. However there is one thing that I would have changed. I would have made the evil guys on red suits more stronger and I guess more 'bossy'. Idk but I felt like on a few scenes the red suits guys weren't really that strong and able to manage the participant properly. I remember one scene where a red guy had to take off his mask in order to handle the situation with a participant (knowing that doing so, he might die!?) Are these red suits guys been trained well enough for their job or not? It just felt that they were weaker than the participants, if it weren't for the guns these red guys would have lost immediately. That's my opinion tho, It's not that big of a deal. The rest was good!Again I liked the plot, I liked the characters and the writing was good. Yes there are things that I didn't quite understand such as why did the brother killed his brother?? Just like that?? What was the purpose of the police guy if then he ended up like that? And there is moreHowever I did enjoy the series and I can't wait for the next season.",8
"I absolutely love it! It reminds me of JIGSAW and ESCAPES ROOM. It make you feel like you are part of the squid game while watching. It will definitely leave you guessing who will survive in the end. I absolutely love HoYeon Jung acting, she's really tough, really cute and beautiful all around. I loved HoYeon Jung character, she kept to herself, strong minded, didn't trust anyone and I love her serious image. She was really amazing! I wish HoYeon Jung could stay for more seasons but unfortunately she died towards the end and I was really upset about it! It was really sad. Keep it coming for more seasons.",10
Very interesting movie and the game seems easy yet super tricky. My favourite part is the honeycomb game.,9
I really enjoy every second of this TV show it's so perfect and amazing it deserves 10 out of 10.,10
"On first episode meeting the girl who stole his money was a mistake from the director because it showed how easy I could predict what happens next . Last episode has many faults
I enjoyed the series but I hoped the scenario would be smarter than what I saw ??",4
Remarkable series but the VIPs must be the worst actors i've ever seen.,8
"The VIP's were awful omg, and I actually sobbed when Ali and the other girl died in the 4th game. 067 is a goddess who we all should aspire to be like. Can we please force 456 to dye his hair back ??",9
An amazing movie I love him. I recommend it to peek it's great so I recommend take a look.,10
"Slow at times, but intense and engaging throughout. Acting was on point and I loved how they mixed different elements of society and human behavior.The only issue was the VIPs. Quite the buzz kill in terms of acting and overall performance. They didn't fit in there they way they should. Casting failGive it a watch peeps!",9
Watch ep 6 and then u will understand why this series is so famous.,10
"Seriously, you guys really didn't know who was behind it? Didn't you really figure out very early on who the Leader was? Every plot of this show was outrageously announced by the director/acting. I give it a 5 because the idea is excellent! Out of the box. But the execution was terrible. It is a very serious mistake to let the viewer know the most important plot of the show in the FIRST EPISODE!!!!!I understand the folks with grades 9, 10. I believe there is a little more repertoire missing.",5
The decision making of the characters is painfully bad and most of the acting is over done and cringey. There are also random side stories and characters that have absolutely no relevance to the show.,5
Only thing i disliked was the amount of Plot Twists. English Dub was alright.,8
"I feel conflicted after finishing the series. After watching the 3rd episode I was hooked! Just absolutely amazing! A solid 10! I'm glad there were only 9 episodes. At this moment I'm not sure exactly when it started going wrong. I agree with others, the VIPs were awful and cliche. And regardless of how much you are into the game you wouldn't sit for hours with such heavy gold masks on! They were beautiful but completely distracting with the awful dialogue. The final episode was very disappointing. After winning the game, they throw him unconscious onto the street. I don't understand why they would stuff the bank card in his mouth. Makes no sense. Fast forward a year later and Gi-hun is a mess. He hadn't yet honored the promise he made to Kang about her younger Brother. Okay fine. And he finds out Il-Nam, the old man is still alive, which was good and bad. We never saw him die, but the reunion didn't work for me. Turns out Il-Nam is responsible for the game. Regardless, after he passes for real, Gi-hun appears to get his act together. He goes to a hair salon and dyes his hair bright pink! Why? I'm sorry I didn't find it funny or necessary. Then he visits and adopts? Kang's brother but dumps him and a load of cash with the dead 'Big Bad's' Mother! THEN it looks like he's going fly and see his son in the US but after an incident and a phone call he turns around with the look of- I'm headed back to the game? Maybe if this had been done differently I'd feel satisfied. But what started as a freaking great show, left a sour taste in my mouth. Sigh.",7
Simply i enjoyed every single minute in the magnificent series.,10
In my opinion they played so ridiculously bad to portrait what they think about the Americans and to mock them with their bad jokes. Their cast was really good and i dont think they just didn't get the right actors to play the Americans.,8
"The show started good gor the couole of episodes but began to downgrade at the endings. The VIPs were awfully bad and full of cringe dialogue of 9 year olds. As for the main lead actor of the show, he was not good in any aspect. The Pakistani guy was more likable than him. Except for one episode I don't think there is any scene in which the main lead actor is useful.",6
"The luckiest unlucky? The question, what does success mean to you? Just try to ask yourself after watching it. What a brilliant, dark, fun & fast paced show to demonstrate metaphor of capitalism. I would love to take this ride again. Excellent showcase of human mind and emotions. The acting was pretty good and the story & plot was crazy. Its the battle of strong people against the weak people covering all aspects such as morality, honesty, sacrifice, smartness, cunningness and so on. Ending was somewhat predictable bht definitely a good show. I do recommend for you to watch it.",10
"A mix of Hunger Games, Parasite, Hostel and Saw.It shows how human nature really is.",10
"Despite how predictable was the plot, I watched it in two days. Well done!BTW, wtf with those VIP characters at the end, they were obnoxiously cringe. Bad acting or they made them on purpose?",7
Definitely gives viewers a good look at what people who are struggling financially with major problems are willing to do for money as well as what people with too much money are willing to do for entertainment. Planned on writing how absolutely nauseating the VIP's were in their acting abilities but SO many people beat me to it. Seriously the dialogue was so awful I was actually getting irritated whenever they were on screen and the delivery would have sounded more human if it had been robotic voices. They manage to grate on your nerves while completely taking you out of the story.,7
"I understand its success, and I see that Netflix knows how to catch with a series (especially with such a remarkable visual production). But on a personal level, I did not enjoy it, I saw it complete just because it is entertaining, but just. It seems to me that the only way to enjoy it would be to ignore the multiple script holes and inconsistencies in the plot, or to appreciate only the technical-visual section.",5
"Nice Korean TV show intense, funny and likeable characters.",10
"It is an ok show nothing that great - typical netflix show.Feel free to watch it, but let the the high rating/reviews inflate your expectations
Nearly everything was really predictable and the things that weren't were of no consequence.",5
"I literally freaking screamed. Sae Byeok was easily the best character in the show (sorry Ali) and quite obviously, the ultimate plot armor for the final game between the two men to happen.It was such a shame cause she was the only main character who never played dirty nor tricked anyone in order to win the games (ie In the red light green light game she could've pushed the antagonist who beat her up but didn't. Only used the knife she smuggled when the antagonist tried to kill her. In the marble game scene, aka the most depressing shh ever, she insisted on playing fair). Also, she was actually the only player brave enough to get insights about the facility when she snuck up in the bathroom's vent. Of all the elimination, hers was the most frustrating because she was the most satisfying winner out of the three. She was fair. Couldn't help but compare her to Usagi from Alice in Borderland. Both of them had knocked some senses into the main characters.Moreover, the actress, Jung Ho Yeon, stole the show for me despite having limited scenes. And now her being an obvious fan favorite (gaining millions and millions of followers on the gram ever since the show debuted on Netlix), I really wish they saved her up for the sequel instead.",8
"It's the twist no one wanted. But I still thought it was a very interesting season. I watched most of it on planes and would not recommend that, I felt bad for the passengers all around me.",8
I don't know what to say except this series is perfection. It's original and it draws you in if you give it a chance.,10
"Just watch it. No hesitation. BINGED WATCHED IT IN ONE GO! I want moreeeee! Didn't know, how this would take me for an emotional/thrilling/suspense / unexpected roller coaster.",9
"Binge watching till the end of the nine episodes!Anxiety, horror, anger, fear, compassion...with all the mixed feelings. Korean series are always good at capturing the humanity in people and the depression of the society. Hopefully there's Season2 coming! TBC...",9
"Is it realistic? This game invented in 1988. Every year so many people disappear and their body never found. Why is the police thinks main role is like crazy dude. And the banks is a joke? So much potholes and predictable dialogues, actions. Meaningless deaths who bet on the who can shape their candy without break.",2
"The series started off with a bang and it just hooked me from the very starting 1st episode and I binge-watched the whole show in 1 day.IT'S ENGAGING,VISUALLY IMPRESSIVE AND THE CHARECTERIZATION OF THE PLAYERS WERE ASLO GOOD. Though it's not a masterpiece but it's an unique take on this interesting concept. AND, ALSO I loved the CLIMAX TWIST.WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND TO ALL OF YOU GUYS!!",9
This series has a really good storyline.You think you know how an episode goes. But it always takes a different turn.It has been very well thought out.Well done and i would say check it out!,8
"Wow, this got off to such a great start and sustained it for 6 episodes. I liked it so much that I binge watched it. Then in episode 7 it did a face plant!! As many reviewers mention: the VIPs are unbearably ridiculous and painful to watch. But in addition to that, in my opinion, the ending is ridiculous!! Such a let down to what was a glorious series. Sorry I wasted any time at all on it!",2
"It started good but end up pretentious.There were many things left unexplained like
1- the videos were already sent to police .2- how did the cop's brother become a master and for what .3- there were people who's supposed to take the MC kidney, but somehow and even though he never paid them back ( since he never used the money ) after a year , he still had his kidneys .4- I don't remember how many players were there but how did they manage to split into groups of tens. It doesn't make any sense .5- the cop that was shot, the body will be found and even if it didn't , he would still be remain missing, which is a huge problem since he's a cop not just a citizen.6- when the old man told his assistant to excuse him from watching the game with the vips and wanted to play with the players, the vips only watched the glass game and the old man was expelled earlier so this doesn't make sense eitherI don't know what is it with Korean drama but they always mess it up , they start good but finish badly , the acting the story line , the plot holes .My god every time they show us the English speakers characters , I just want to throw up . The whole scene , the decorations , who the heck thought of that , why ruin it .And I must finish with , if you're gonna watch this , you should watch the movie serie saw instead , it's better anyway , since this was a huge rip off.I wished that the girl would have won .. and that the MC would have ended just as greedy and betrayer as others , it would be a better story line and very unexpected since she was only a side character .",1
Very unique storyline that entertain you each of episode and very much engaging. Each game that are featured is simple yet thrilling. You don't want to miss this one.,9
"When they kill the doctor there is 39 of them left.The woman was moved to the next game and 38 of them went to play the marble game, but when the game was finished only 16 of them came back and it should have been 19, since they played in pairs.",7
In our present day there is reality shows like survivor looks like the squid game but not killing but I'm surr soon we will see the real squid game in our live.The serie is very good and attractive. I like it.,9
"I enjoyed the suspenseful ride and twisted concept of the series! Actor HoYeon Jung stood out most to me; especially after finding out it was her acting debut. Death scenes in this show comes by form of execution, which was almost too much to watch at times. Show lacks no detail within the games facility and does a great job of forming bonds and friendships in such a doer situation! Only thing I wish for was a ending that brings actor Lee Jung-jae closer to his family (daughter) at the end.... More than just a phone call was needed after leaving her standing in the rain like that ??. Overall great show, great acting, great concept, season 2 worthy Netflix!",9
"Genuinely interesting all the way through, it plays out like a living anime. All the characters are super fun to watch and everything feels genuine. There will definitely be a few things you can call a mile away but a lot more you could never tell, no doubt best thing Netflix has put out in years!",9
I'm in the type of person that can normally get everything that's about to happen in a movie and or shop well they were parts of this where I was shocked maybe last second I would get it but anyways it was incredible regardless of how bad the VIPs act this is one of the best shows I've ever seen in my entire life absolutely incredible.,9
"I have watched a couple of Netflix shows, like Umbrella Academy, Stranger Things, Lupin and La Casa De Papel.But this show, is by far the best.I heard about this show by various pages throughout social media, and from a couple of friends, so I thought, lets give it a try.After the first episode, I was already in love with the show. The show is very bingeworthy.And man, what a great show this was, I hope after that ending a season 2 comes soon.",10
"If you're looking for the stereotypical K-Drama with romance, no cussing, nudity, sex, or gore, DO NOT watch this. Netflix has absolutely smashed the Korean television stereotype out of the park - in a good way. The twists and shock that this series has is mind-bending. It will have your jaw on the floor after each episode. I'd say my only gripe is the open ending. I know 99% of K-Dramas don't get a second season, but I REALLY hope for a continuation with this one.",10
The headline tells the most. The series in itself is great. But by the time the VIPs came i started cringeing. The Vips sound in their lines like the read it from a paper and their intonation was really bad. Otherwise great series.,8
"A powerful series, a powerful message. Amazing experience.",10
"+ brilliant storyline, keeps you gripped until the end
+ great acting from the main actors
+ dubbed in English was fine and easy to follow, subtitles well done too
+ really got attached to the characters, got a bit emotional in parts!left me with a lot of questions at the end of the seriesfound the ending a little frustrating, maybe I didn't understand it?!",8
"This series really exceeded my expectations! It's almost close to perfection actually. The rules and regulations of the game isn't that unfair. Moreover, it's the most considerate survival game challenge i've ever seen. Given the fact that they themselves are the one who made the decision to participate.I can see in this series the combination of gantz, saw, the purge, money heist and alice in borderland. If i were to compare this to Alice in Borderland, i definitely would say this is better. Maybe because of the pandemic when it was release and made but nevertheless, i must say that the Squid Game has a very unique content.Games are not too complicated and not that easy but they needs some improvements. Games actually went well because of the certain roles of the players and great portrayals!And lastly im very fond of the thrills the series brings in every episode that makes you end up rushing to see the next scenarios in the next episodez.",9
"The marble episode is simply gratuitous. There is no reason for it to be as drawn out as it is, and there is no reason to not simply imply instead of showing the deaths. Anyone who likes this episode is simply sadistic.Beyond that, the ending two episodes don't meet what one would expect from a story. Basically, you get a cliff-hanger that is misanthropic. The old man is upset that people are killing each other and he preaches about life to the main character, yet he's the force behind all of the deaths?And what about the religion that's brought in? Why go after religion when it doesn't matter to the plot?After the marble episode, I only finished the series because I thought there might be something upcoming to redeem the story. I was wrong to expect that kind of intelligent writing.This is a mess; don't waste your time.",2
We didn't need to see foreign vip actors that wasn't necessary.,10
"What a amazing series from start to end ,really no words .best movie or serie regarding games .Korea took it in extream beauty level .so much lessons to learn by this series .I enjoyed more then money hesit season 3.4 and 5 .thx to Netflix showing or making series like that .hates off Korea and Netflix.",10
"Just a silly scenario, with a big investment, and a cheesy end. Please stop comparing it to Casa de Papel.",1
"Just binged watched 4 episodes in a row. Amazing!Extraordinarily original and fresh. There are some feelings of Old Boy, Parasite and Japan's Battle Royale, and of course hints of Black Mirror (the title graphics make that very clear) - but overall the production style and content is incredibly fresh.It's best to go in without knowing much about it and just let it tell the story.I see a few here complaining about VIP acting, I have no clue what that is, but I found the acting overall very good.I don't speak Korean, so maybe they sensed more than me.Since it's mainly a character study, elements of the hapless yet hopeful fool (the main character) and stereotypical thug (the main antagonist) obviously exist to narrate the story as it progresses.Let's face it, if this was just outright brutality that would be very off-putting and just become an average SAW-type horror story, this is clearly not the intention here. Subtle messaging abounds. For your consideration.The design of the production varies from the bleak harshness of the outside world to the colourful Escher and Minecraft inspired world of the childish game itself.With Star Wars like drone soldiers mindlessly ensuring the players stay in line. Under a hierarchy based on shapes and a Vader-like controller that keeps you wondering what exactly the entire situation is about.And that's where the Old Boy feeling really kicks in. Is this controller seeking revenge from some childhood slight or is it intended as a learning experience?Overall, I would just suggest watching episode 1 and if you get hooked like me, then you've found something you will absolutely love.Can't really say any more until I'm done watching it all.But I'm going to take a break because binge watching is a crime.Or it should be. Especially given the work gone into this.Thanks for reading.",10
Wow so exiting and good! Loved it so much! Highly recommend it you wont regret it.,10
So fas so good but please Netflix there is no need to season 2 you will ruined it.,8
The poor and the actors are very realistic however the vips ruined everything with the terrible acting.,8
"As a Korean series, it was good actually. Good acting from the Korean actors, but foreigners? NO, It was extremely bad as you feel that they are just reading what they have to say
Anyways, it takes eight for all.",8
"This is not as provocative as they want this to be. Many books and stories have the same genre of ""all humans are capable of doing bad things when pushed too hard"".",7
"First of all, that was one of the best designs I have ever seen in my life! The idea is great but there were many flaws, like the overdramatizing, overeating some characters are just don't know how to act! The VIP actors were terrible. You get bored in the middle episodes I don't understand the hype about this show.",6
"This tv show is very good to me, something different from what we are used to watch, for me is very original.",8
"Very good. Worth watching, can't wait for season 2.",9
"Squid Game is one of the most interesting and gripping shows I've watched in a while. It grabbed my attention and kept it, and while that doesn't take a lot to do, this one made me come back again and again. It's creative, the atmosphere it creates is truly unique, and it shows a horrific perversion of the human mind, both in the VIPs and the Front Man himself.The VIPs were okay. I thought the character design and writing was spot on for what they wanted to portray, but the actors were definitely sub-par. Seems like everybody has said this already though, so I don't need to say much about it.Definitely a 9/10 for me. I'll come back and rewatch it when season 2 (hopefully) airs.",9
"This show is a masterpiece, very deep in many aspects, the only negative aspect are the VIP's.",9
"The first episodes hit you like a hard punch in the stomach. Original and well produced series. Disturbing, bizarre and unpredictable. Many very good characters with the big exception of the VIP people that were very bad acting. Korean filmmakers show more and more their ability to make high quality dramas. You are kept on the edge of your seat for the first half of the series. Then it loses some steam and focus. The ending a bit disappointing and the opening for a second seasons feels totally unncessary. One season is enough and it is a very good watch for the not-faint-hearted-viewers.",8
"Parasite, Saw, Hunter X Hunter, Cube, Black Mirror, The Platform, Oldboy... Takeshi's Castle?An unexpected mix of all my favourite things - Squid Game is the best thing I've watched this year.An intriguing premise that actually delivers. I went in with no expectations and was blown away!",10
OfbjsnsnsmymmanNNKYKKYSKSMSNS S DNJJjsjsjsksksmmsmykksksksskksykykmsmsmsmyyjjyjy.,9
This serie was mindblowing but the vips actwork was so terrible i cant give it a 10. Thankfully vips were not a major part of the serie.,9
"With nods to 2001: A Space Odyssey (Blue Danube score and depth of meaning regarding some of the eliminations) and Battle Royale (an all out fight for survival), whilst some of the acting leaves much to be desired, the concept and plot raises this to be an addictive, binge worthy series.Granted I watched this with the English dubbing, which may lose some of the intended dialogue, but the main characters give a boost to the otherwise mediocre acting of some of the other members of the cast.The story - albeit an old one of man versus man in a primordial sense - is engaging and keeps you interested. The side story of the masked individuals is perhaps an unnecessary addition, and I found it disengaging from the main plot. That being said, if you ignore it and focus on the primary plot, it can be forgiven.Overall 8/10. Watch it and enjoy!",8
Me and the missus really enjoyed this series we watched it all in the evening.Saying that we both thought the ending was a little too predictable and we both had an inclination about the ending from episode 2.Give it a watch by all means because there's some really good characters and action but don't expect a blockbuster ending.,7
Nostalgia. Reminded me of the 90s where I went through a phase of buying or renting every VHS tape that had a tartan label. From there I couldn't sleep for a while! This show is very good and will hook you in. However like other reviews it is slightly ruined by the cheezy B list VIP actors! It's like they ran out of actors late in the season and grabbed a few guys from a bar! Please take note of this for the next installment as it's an entertaining show.,8
Squid Game has an interesting plot that hooks you on the first episode. The rules of the show is ever changing though with surprises on each entry. How far would you be willing to go to play the game?,10
"I hate movies/shows with subtitles but, I absolutely loved this show!!",10
"Wonderful acting and great suspense, old wine on new bottles maybe, but tapped in a way that will surprise you all the time.Please watch it with the Korean voice acting and not the dubbed English, no matter your native tongue, it will give the show much more depth for you.I absolutely loved this series until the episode where the vip's came along and almost completely ruined it for me. Still good, but they took it down at least a few stars.",8
"Long time viewer of both Netflix and K-dramas, and this one is a fantastic blend of the best of both. The amazing, succinct story-telling from Korean dramas plus the uncensored gore, cursing, and production quality of a Netflix original. This show is unpredictable, well written, well acted, and extremely unique. When I initially saw the premise/trailer I thought it was going to be a copy of Alice in Borderland, and while there are similarities, there are a ton of differences that made each one unique (I liked Squid Game better).For the love of all that is holy, PLEASE watch the original Korean language version with subtitles. The dub actors did okay, but the speech and inflection nuances are left out. Plus the English dub seems to go off the subtitles rather than the actual language, (I can understand some Korean) so there are definitely some liberties taken that change the meaning/tone of certain scenes and characters.For those who are complaining about the VIP's: yep, that is a trademark of K-dramas, using bad actors for the English/foreign characters. I recognized some from other K-dramas, and their acting is unfortunately stiff and subpar. Perhaps now that the show is so popular and may even get a second season, future foreign characters will be played by decent actors.Either way, this show is a great, gory thriller that has a thought-provoking underlying message: what would you be willing to do for money?",8
"Seriously, 10/10? A true thriller fan would find this painful to watch.",3
"Watching Squid Game makes me think about a lesser known horror movie ""Would you Rather"". Same concept of people participating on a game for money and ends up all being dead except the main character who goes home with the money but with a dead loved one. Acting is pretty good, as well as the effects, but the plot was predictable right after they came back to the game. The MC's actions feels unrealistic, suddenly making an enemy out of his friend after he actually just barely saved all of them at the stepping stones. He also didn't do anything about his daughter who was the whole point of him joining the game. The police man intruder sub plot feels more like a filler since it doesn't do anything about the actual plot, it could have been entirely erased from the story and won't change anything about the outcome. Even the old man twist at the end doesn't really do much about everything. Overall, still pretty watchable and a nice way to kill some time during Pandemic. Hopefully, if Season 2 does come, they could connect all those plot holes and make it work.",7
"First I hate not having the option of listening in the original language with English subtitles. No option other than dubbing...my absolute least favorite way to watch. Now, the acting, or rather overacting big time. The main protagonist is an absolute waste of space and acts like Jerry Lewis on acid! The overacting and drivel dialogue makes it a ZERO, but not possible here.",7
"One of the best series i have every watched! It gives you suspense, drama and exciting moments. The plot becomes more and more interesting as the episodes go. The characters are well established, the performances are exceptional. Please do watch it!",9
"Another series were it keeps you on your toes, but then the ending has you scratching your head. Why?????",6
"I genuinely enjoyed this show from beginning to end. A true social commentary on humanity, competition and avarice. When the carnage is occurring it's nail-biting and between the games you get compelling human drama - a fantastic addition to the ""kill game"" genre that seems to always be elevated by Korean talent behind and in front of the camera.",8
"The first couple of episodes a very well done and pack a punch, but by the end it just seems to run out of steam. The marbles episode was the last real swerve, after that it becomes paint by numbers to the point that I started fast forwarding through most of it just to get it to end.Early episodes are an eight, final episodes are a three.",6
"Even tho some elements fall flat, what works in this show works brilliantly. Whether the stunning visuals, gorgeous set designs and production value, interesting and likable main characters, spot on casting, the suspense of an engaging and unique story, decent plot twists, dark and mature subplots rarely covered in mainstream tv, good acting and more. I myself would also take great notice to the second episode, ""Hell"", that really makes great effort into showing realistically the sad backstories of our characters to justify why they would even put themselves in such situation.The flaws include a couple of bad performances, the VIP's seem like a really wasted opportunity to actually have memorable villains instead we got generic and awful eye-rolling performances, some decisions are questionable, the whole plot line of the cop had an underdeveloped ending that made the subplot feel pointless and underwhelming etc.But overall i def recommend this series as it is unique and engaging in a way that will leave you enjoying every minute of it and asking for more.",8
"This is a great show at first i thought ""Squid Game"" what a awful name but i got tons of good recommendations to watch it so i did and it was GREAT!!! Acting was good and the plot wad always aligned you can pretty much but two and two together towards the end if your smart but for most who can your in for a big surprise anyway good show. I recommend all to watch this masterpiece.",9
It's an amazing take on a really dark side of entertainment and games.,9
"Sorry. That's a crude summation of this brilliant series. It's a brutal, tense satire on the economic systems we are all trapped in. Would those who lose most at the game, who gamble and get into debt far beyond what they can repay as wage slaves, would they risk their lives to be free? Of course; they would play the Squid Game.Motivations and characters are carefully fleshed out. The concept of the games we play as children having life & death consequences in adult life is intelligently, deviously developed. It combines quality, international art house drama style with thrills & bloody horror. If you're ready for something challenging and intense play the Squid Game.",10
"The Cinematography is good, not boring as a series.",8
Series was tracking as a solid 7 or 8 prior to the last episode. All of the finishing 'revalations' and gotchas were just plain stupid and not needed. Otherwise great upto that point.,2
"Since you're here it's not really possible to tell you to go into the series not knowing anything about it, like I did. I read something about the VIPS being poor actors so I was constantly looking for them VIPS who eventually play a minor role at the end of the series.I see some people giving the series such a low score because of it, but in my opinion you're doing the series no good by that.I had such an amazing time with the series and tried not to finish it too fast. Eventually I finished it in 3 runs but I could finish it in one run it's that fun.The series never follow the American standardized way of a build up and the way choices are made. There were many moments where I expected something to happen where the opposite happend.The series is fast and original with great actors. Yes there is a lot of gore and violence, but fast enough you'll see it's not (solely) about that. Especially the episode Gganbu is some of the best I've ever seen in a series.If you're doubting about seeing it; give it a try, it is amazing!",9
"The story, the motif is great, but the conversation, the acting between characters are so lame.It could be a cultural things that Koreans speak that way.Just my opinion. Take it or leave it.",7
"I truly enjoyed this show from the beginning but eventually less and less when people started comparing it to some of the greats.Squid Game is meaningful and has a strong message against capitalism but what people fail to see somehow its a rip off of Alice in borderland..In a nutshell, You will enjoy watching this but don't let the hype get to you.",7
I have an account for 10 years on IMDB but it will be my first review. I had to write it because I'm so angry at this stupid show.This show is so so so dumb and predictable. Already in the second episode I knew that this was the old guy plot to relive his younger days (the black and white footage) and that the last stand will be between those two colleagues. It was also very apparent that the brother of the policeman will be either one of the VIPs or the front man. 9 hours wastedThe show is only saved by the great acting.Never again.,2
"The sereal started very interesting. You dont know why happening this, who is behind this, and what kind of child game thay will play. But after episode 7 when the vip-s arrived, the whole concept are turnd up side down. All the serial become predictible, like im feeling my self as a precog. Who is the vip-s, who is the firshand whatever. That makes from 8 star to 7. But is still a good seral. A new type of battle royale. But the most annoying thing is, the concept was the child games, and that is gone when the vip-s was arrived. Why this concept changed? That was the moment when i changed my mind ftom 7 to 6 star. And of course the vip-s are super lame, but the concept change are way more worst than bad acting.",6
"Great story, great pacing and visually, it packs a punch! It is similar to Battle Royale however, it delves deeper and provides great character development and a real feast for the eyes in terms of the colourful sets and and costumes. It's raises many questions around humanity and how far you would go to help others or save yourself.It's a wild ride from the moment it begins and the relatable characters really draw you in. There have been a lot of comments about the VIPs - just ignore those! The version of the film I watched is dubbed so maybe there's a reason for the slightly off-pace intonations; but that doesn't take away from the performances.It's certainly binge worthy and if you can handle the odd violent scene, then go for it!",9
"I do love my typical hero's journey Marvel/DC movies/series but this one was something different entirely, a breath of fresh air.Unexpectedly I opened up my Netflix account and this show's plot synopsis grabbed my attention. Next thing I know I'm getting pulled all the way through an unexpected 1-day binge session (about 9 hours).The show is slow at times yet never boring, just taking its time between brutal fatalities (and brutal they are). The characters are troubled, each of them with their flaws (even the main character). That too felt fresh compared to the typical Hollywood protagonists who always seem to be so likable with a ton of charisma and humor.Creative story wise but also in its graphics. I loved the looks of the location with its game rooms and the characters. Speaking of Marvel, the costume of the Frontman would make a great Dr Doom outfit.Anyway long story short, just go watch it. You won't regret it.",9
"The series, Kalash Jamila, from Iraq, I wish, Part Two, Asun.",9
"At some scenes, the actors are overacting. The cinematography is not too good. There is a nonsense part, where they play that rope game, why the old man's hands gotta be locked if he was the maker of this game? And yeah, they not supposed to be blame each other players in that arena! The ending is just ruined all the previous episode. Peoples need to see hunger games before they say that this is the best korean series -_-",1
"Good theme, but story developed in a bad way. POOR DIRECTION
Idle for 2hr movie release than that of an 9episode series.",5
A unique film and a nice concept. I was enjoying this series until the VIPs arrived and ruined it in about episode 5 or 6. I think these VIPs just happened to be teaching English in Korea at the time and applied for some extra cash. The acting was horrible and severely cheapened the whole film. It left a bad taste in my mouth for the rest of the series unfortunately. I can't recommend this film to family because the acting form the VIPs is just so embarrassing.NETFLIX - remove/replace the VIPs with real actors - budgets can't be that tight.,7
"This show is incredible and sad at the same time because it shows us human nature in a world dominated by the value of money, how far we can go by having money on one side and how sick those who have money are, in short we are doomed for money.",10
"I haven't read any reviews yet but I don't have to for this one. This was a little slow to pick up, cliché, predicable, has some spotty acting, and I didn't like the progression of the games or the last episode. Those are all my nitpicks and even with those, I still feel like I have to give this a ten.So, why the ten? This just reminded me of Breaking Bad and A Game of Thrones when it should have reminded me of Battle Royale and so on. This is because I simply chewed through this content. The character development is amazing, loved the anti-capitalism overtone, the scenery was great, the dubbing was very well done, the acting for the most part was topnotch and there are some really good memorable, quotable and heartfelt moments. I'll keep it short. If the trailer interested you, you probably won't be disappointed.""Everyone is equal here"" ""You think money can fix everything""?",10
"Promising storyline, interesting plot points, with a realistic cultural context aswell as the social dispute. Squid Game has many interesting and unique elements trough out the show while showcasing our present reality and how cruel it may be, with a decent written script and great acting. The only cons about the show is defiently the VIP's acting and the ending. Would recommend.",7
"I think I haven't seen a more creative kdrama than squid game. And you can really see the hardwork and dedication the director has put into this great work of art.The characters, their motivations,cinematography, acting ,everything is top notch. Only complaint I would have would obiviously be VIPs but nonetheless best drama from korea till now.",9
The people's bar hit that low ? People who whatched real thrills they really think that is enjoyable!? Or it is all about the tik tok generation. The public tatste tendency is horrifying.,1
"Pretty well done, This series is heavily inspired by the anime Kaiji.If you like this series, you should give it a try the anime version, which is kinda old but good!Story is great, actors are average but story covers for them!",8
