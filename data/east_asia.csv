East Asia,"Beautifully crafted series. Never read the manga, so I can't comment on how faithful it is. But it has good acting and character development. The cinematography and set designs are beautiful. Good plot that kept me goed al the way through. If you like movies such as Battle Royale, you'll love this show.",10
East Asia,Rationality always wins. I love japanise culture. Only people using their mind survive.,10
East Asia,I dont like this type of genre. But what a show. Thks is superb tv,10
East Asia,I enjoyed this one alot. The dialogue is a bit cliché at times but other than that i love it.,9
East Asia,Only one episode in but hooked. The acting is amazing. The idea is both super interesting and horrifying. A show of smarts. I'd be dead already. Can't wait to watch more.,10
East Asia,"This show has a fun premise with great production. Some episodes are very strong and worth watching, but otherwise, the show is littered with poorly written characters that at times are acted out very stiffly. You can feel the actors going overboard or are poorly acting out a few too many scenes. The plot manages to hold interest but messes up small details that would often leave you face-palming or shaking your head.Overall, the show is a far cry from the 10/10 rating many reviews seem to be giving it... Think of it like a good way to mindlessly pass the time.",7
East Asia,"As someone who's a big fan of the manga, I think the Netflix adaptation does a decent job for anyone trying to find more Alice in Borderland content. However, the devil is in the details, and except for the main story arcs, it's quite different from the original story.Many characters are introduced earlier than expected, and some games have changed concepts entirely. Certain story beats are shuffled around or erased. In addition, Arisu participates in several games that he wasn't part of originally. I would have to say to avid fans of the manga to watch this series pretending you have no prior knowledge unless you like to be disappointed. But by itself, it was spectacular to watch this interpretation of Alice in Borderland.",7
East Asia,"Top Notch Seat Edge Thriller !!
Cinematography & Soundtracks Are Mind-blowing!!
If You Are Thriller Fan , Then Watch it!",10
East Asia,Awesome survival game series. I was waiting for this type of series. Great acting and decent effects. and fun to watch.,10
East Asia,"Great production without long tirades, I still gave 10 stars as I look forward to the rest.",10
East Asia,"Watched a lot of films and serie. And I can tell you ""This was so awesome""!!! they did play with my heart when I watched the full serie. I really thought I was with them the hole time it felt so real. #Thank you #curious & exited for season 2-Stephaniesx314",10
East Asia,"The first few episodes felt fresh and exciting, but dipped in the middle and I kept hoping for the latter episodes to reach a climax and in parts it seemed like it was on the way there, but then kind of fell flat in the end.The plot itself isn't bad at all and definitely binge worthy, but can't rate higher than 6 because of terrible acting. Cringey and awkward all round. I've seen some of the actors in other films/dramas and I know they can do much better, so I assume the fault lies with the director himself.",6
East Asia,"If you love the concept of a show revolving around games of life or death this is for you. Think of the Escape Room or Saw movies, but inspired by Alice in Wonderland. I wonder give you more but tye show is best not knowing anything going in. I guaranteed you will not be able to wait for Season Two. Oh God Netflix don't cancel this after one season. My heart would break. I highly recommend it.",10
East Asia,The plot of thus show is great you never new what will happen in the show,10
East Asia,"The story is great, keeps you guessing and it makes you try to figure out what would you do if you were in the games !!! A nice mix of battle royal , saw , scape room and of course the analogy to Alice in wonderland. A must watch show",10
East Asia,"Oh man, this is nuts, probably the best tv show I've watched in 2020. when I first heard about this series I was excited and also worried. Because in past most manga or anime adaptations were so bad. After watching 1st episode my mind was clear and I know this series going to be epic. Director Sato Shinsuke excellently brought this manga into the real world. The plot is like the mix of hunger games and escape room but Alice in Borderland is much more than those two. In hunger games they just kill each other for survival, escape room there are different games but limited to a building. But in here we have games + open world. it's good if There were more backstory for the character I was interested in. About the acting our protagonist Ryohei Arisu act by Yamazaki Kento he was great in this series, the way he expresses feelings is so natural. I am very impressed with the supporting cast they did an excellent job. There were few uses of CGI and they are good. About Cinematography I loved it, in an episode there two battels in those battels the way they use slow-motion effect is great. This hard R rated show full of valance and blood. I highly recommend this show to watch. Then have a nice ride with Alice in Borderland.",9
East Asia,"This is an amazing show, fantastic, thriller, action, dramatic, everything you can imagine, it's an amazing story and I cant wait for season 2",10
East Asia,"Very intense, many interesting characters, not like: ""I have seen all this a hundred times already."" I can recommend! :)",10
East Asia,"As a manga reader, this series has shocked me and delivered everything perfectly! The storyline exactly follows the original content without anything new or strange. Also, I just thought how crazy it was to how identical the actors looked! The whole show looked so realistic, including the strong emotions and the settings. It was able to touch my heart better than the manga in my opinion. The story progresses very smoothly and has a great balance of the action and character development. It ended perfectly at the right time but also at the same time where I wanted to watch MORE! I was only disappointed when I had to stop at the last episode :[",10
East Asia,"This was the most fantastic display of absolute and utter nonsense, that I've seen in a long while. It's hard to pick which was worse; the acting, the writing, the directing or the storyline - I believe in the end, it was a magical combination of total lack of talent in all areas, that made this cringe-fest so painfully entertaining to watch.It's like it was written by someone who's never witnessed human interaction before and performed by androids who lack the full programming to be able to pass as actual humans. The dialogues are so bizarre and the directing makes you scratch your head and wonder if the person in change is a toddler or a golden retriever, maybe. Nothing in this production makes any sense, and I'm amazed I managed to suffer through it all. It would absolutely blow my mind if this trash got renewed.",1
East Asia,"I m now one ep left. The game is good. We get to know some background, the logic stands. Its believable.
Some hundreds of people awake in different parts of a big city as the only inhabitants. After a while it seems that the whole city is controlled so that they regulary play survival games: betray or be dead, logic escape rooms, sports rooms etc. Refuse and die. loose and die. after winning you get on the phone, everyone get one at each game, rewards: 3 says to live. or 9. you get the point. you can live only by playing.
the games are classified each by a playing card: hearts, for ex., are tough. means you only live by betraying a team mate. difficulty is obvious: from one to 10. until now nobody has seen a figure card.
when we get there with this group, youll see, there is already players and a hotel named ,,beach,, where something like a state or mob is installed. the leaders, the muscles(actually, guns) and the plebs. they figured that gathering the whole pack of card will allow one of the a free pass, a visa to the normal world.
the game gets tougher.
a good show. enterteining.",8
East Asia,"Don't let the criticism/hate get to you and just Ignore the low ratings and watch and judge for yourself. Personally I enjoyed the series! As a manga reader and anime watcher I definitely think they did a decent job with this series in most aspects. Though it is not exactly the same as the manga in some parts it still manages to keep the thrill of it. Yes this concept of escape room and survival of the fittest is used a lot, But trust me this series was super interesting and kept my family of all ages entertained. Hopefully they don't cancel this and will release a 2nd season! Don't sleep on this masterpiece.",10
East Asia,"While the game premise may be not new, the series is still interesting from start to finish. Despite relatively short series and many characters, able to build up interesting backstories for some of the characters very well with great effect on viewer's emotion.
The sound track and acting are good. CGI is great for TV series. So grateful to make this live TV.
Please note I haven't read manga, haven't even heard of this series before. The cliffhanger ending makes me want for season 2. I finished watching this in 24 hours. Definitely recommended!",10
East Asia,Surprisingly very good. Definitely watch. I was only going to watch one and ended up watching them all.,9
East Asia,"* First, this is not for kids! There is a lot of killing throughout the series and some light sex. *If you combined The Purge and The Game you would have Alice In Boarderland! This show is nonstop crazy fun! Hold on to your seat and prepare to binge!",9
East Asia,The best! Hoping Japan will bring more like this to the Netflix! They are the best in Death survivor games and Mind games genre. Seriously I enjoy Watching this series than Money Heist or any other famous series out there.,10
East Asia,This is a really great show to watch that has so many different things to look forward to in each episode with unexpected twists.,10
East Asia,"They were truly able to capture the feeling of the manga.You could feel the anger and sadness from the characters. It still misses a lot of background information about all the characters but what could you expect in a tv series. I loved how they sualized the games from manga to the bigger screen. One of netflix's best manga to live action.
Overal wonderful",10
East Asia,"AMAZING SERIES!
Must watch!
Especially if you like anime/manga!",9
East Asia,"Just finished the series in one sitting and can say that it's a solid binge watch.
The way you get used to the friendship in the first episodes and then suddenly lose them was a very unexpected turn, for some reason it felt like it was too soon and then the influx of new faces felt a little over the top for me.
But overall the series kept the interest and would watch the season 2, if renewed.
The ending definitely assumes the continuation and sort of the most exciting part of the games. Really liked the final scene with huge cards",10
East Asia,"It's really exciting about the first few episodes, the idea is brilliant n sci fic fans surely will love it. But it's becoming quite likely the same for game play to survive....ehhhh patience needed.",5
East Asia,"I thought this would be that kind of movie where magic appears all of a sudden when it comes to the main characters' death (Karube and Chota). It turned out I was wrong. It saddens me, but I'm not disappointed. I think that what makes this series felt so real and intense! Also, great characters, although sometimes they act a little bit off. I really enjoyed watching it and I'm hoping for a second season!",9
East Asia,"We all watch different types of tv shows but some of them gives you a unique experience that you didn't feel it with the others. Well that's what happened to me watching Alice In BorderLand, I really got hooked up with the events that took place and I can't wait to see what happened next. Also since that it was inspired from a manga i was afraid since that a lot of other inspirited work ending up being so trashy especially the Netflix adapted one, but this one proves me wrong the characters are really will fit despite the fact that some of them has been introduced way to early in comparison to its manga. Overall i would really recommend you to watch it this was the first review that i have ever did in imdb, but i really felt like it's necessary to share my opinion on this.",10
East Asia,"This series is so Japanese (and so Tokyo-ish in particular). Characters are transported to another world suddenly, with no explanation. The story flows with all its strangeness and has an open ending (for season 2). The violence, tragedy, and darkness of the series always keep me on edge.
Perfect for binge-watching on the weekend.",8
East Asia,"From the first episode itself, you will be glued to your seat. It is a thriller and will literally keep you on edge until you finish the entire series in one sitting. A must-watch show if you are looking for an addictive series with a unique plot.",10
East Asia,"I was amazed after watching the show. Thriller ,excitement all in one. Soon after i start watching i knew it will be a heck of a shoe. Waiting for season 2",10
East Asia,"Never got bored watching anyway. Brilliant music, camera work etc. I feel like the people putting it down are not being fair on the genre. its not meant to be true to life. Too me it felt like inhabiting the world of a video game at times, which is no bad thing, which is the point of manga, its not meant to be true to life, its life on steroids x 10 (which this is by the way). I also liked the character building a lot. Very much looking forward to season 2, I also finished it in 24hrs.",10
East Asia,"Seriously, I can't stand when there is a good premise that gets done wrong because of stupid plot holes. Spoiler alert. When the Beach game starts, it says there are 58 participants, yet there are WAY more than that, not just a few more, but considerably more people! They literally just had to change a number to make that hole disappear. I hated how the last few episodes played out. I was a firm supporter before the whole beach story started, but then it just snowballed into oblivion. I'm giving it a decent review just because I did enjoy the first few episodes and I don't want to deter people from watching.",7
East Asia,"If you like Squid Games or Battle Royal this a MUST watch for you! Yes you!I really felt the need to submit my review, because you can tell the creators put a lot of love in the series and they deserve all the prais (sorry for the bad English).The series has a little but of a slow start because of the character building, but than imidiatly captures you in a twist you probably would not expect. From than on you will be on the edge of your seat. After that, you are hooked. Cant say anything more than that.All of the characters are interresting. The acting is A+ and the concept(s) are cool and as fresh as can be expected.Have fun watching!",9
East Asia,"Intense & fast paced throughout, but sadly not so much for the last episode. it was all over the place & so much nonsense. 2 girls recording the base, walking around & everyone dont seem to even look at them, did they use invisibility cloak? casually heading to enemy base with no fear nor expecting defense/laser etc.",7
East Asia,Just going to say that I love that they didn't go easy on recreating It to live action. It's so amazing,10
East Asia,"I did read the manga a couple of years ago, and I must say that it really is an accurate representation of the series. Really happy to see so much budget put into the series.",10
East Asia,"I went in after watching the ambiguous trailer and first of all this show is very binge worthy. I will pull you in for entire night. I was hoping this was a limited series but nope, looks like there is going to be a second season.Without spoiling anything, this story starts with three friends getting caught in a simulation type situation which goes in deeper and spreads fast. Each game was designed creatively, in a SAW like fashion where you betray some and sacrifice some. Our lead protagonists are very likeable and worthy of rooting for. They try to give important characters back story which helps us connect.Action scenes are well shot, there is some gore but not at the cost of self gratification. Character representations are tastefully done and plot points are easy to understand yet remain unpredictable to some extent.Kudos to the team, actors, DoP, sound designers, VFX team, writers and production team for such incredible work.Watch it in original language and watch this one for sure.",9
East Asia,"I haven't read the manga yet still enjoyed watching the stories. I really appreciate the effort from director, staffs and the casts in giving their best; I smiled, shocked (because of Niragi and Usagi) and cried (especially in eps 3). And thank you for the smart and amazing stories coming from the mangaka, Aso Haro for making this work, and for Netflix to make this into live action. Can't wait for the second season!",10
East Asia,"After 10 minutes I wanted to quit. There was a messaging conversation going on that took minutes. On a personal note, I hate people who are all day long on their phone.
Fortunately I did not quit. What a story, what a character development act... and good actors. For me, one of the best series of 2020. Looking forward for series 2.",9
East Asia,The pacing is masterful and the execution of the series premise is magnificent. I will be recommending this show to my friends for sure.,10
East Asia,Edge of the seat thriller....first few epicodes are really amazing.... Kudos to the makers... enjoyed every second.,10
East Asia,"I have to admit that the show starts interesting, some teenagers move to an alternate universe where you have to play games in order to survive. It builds up to more complex games and even some of the initial main persons die in the games.But the moment the series move to the beach it becomes ridiculous and completely unbelievable. We have a huge group of good-looking teenage kids walking around in bikini/swim suits (so you can't hide guns...right), partying most of the times. What happend to all the older people they met before they went to the beach? Older people aren't able to find the beach?
The dialogues become really poor and flashbacks silly. Funny it to see that descent acting also drops with it and becomes really poor and some of the (bad) characters become silly stereotypes.To top it in the end-game while all others are simply shot when they object, Arisu just gets beaten up but keeps getting back with more silly arguments and waits with his revelation of the ""murderer"" till the last moment while wasting time on a silly discussion.So the shows starts fascinating, but looses it more and more towards the end...but I guess it will appeal to teenagers...",5
East Asia,"The acting was good just to long with a plot that gets old, not many likable characters in this series and I'm being kind with 6 stars.",6
East Asia,"It's a bit of a common topic that every manga/anime adaptation into live action fails.. I mean none of them have been great so far... This is the best we've been given. For comparisons sake.. watch the first 5 minuets of the netflix 'deathnote' movie..Go have a shower for about 45 mins, take a lot of xanax to forget you saw those first 5 mins and then watch this series..Watch it in Japanses with subs, I didn't bother with the dub but it really was pulpy awesome scifi. Im a total cynic but I know when to turn my brain off and not pick apart things because the core of what I am watching is great.Normal score a solid 7/10 but giving higher because its a successful manga adaptation that isnt terrible",9
East Asia,"Well... acting is a bit bland beside for supporting chracter, background story for each character is too short so that you cant feel why this character doing that.but, im watchin this series after finished the manga, so i know why this character doing something like that.my suggestion, DONT READ THE MANGA!!! you will know background story for this series, and quite plot twist.enjoy this series, after that... you can read the manga to know better!!MUST WATCH!!",9
East Asia,"There are Series on Netflix that you have high hopes for or just seems good, but end up flat on their Faces when you finally watch it. On the other Hand, there are Series that you don't have a lot of expectations or know little about, but turn out to be a really big surprise.This is one of those Series, I literally knew nothing about it, I just tried it out and it turns out to be one of the best Series I have seen this Year. It is a Mystery-Action-Adventure-Thriller about a group of Friends who end up in a Place where they are forced to participate in Games that result in Life or Death.This Season the Series didn't really focus too much on the ""Why"" and ""How"" the People ended up where they are, it focused more on the Games themselves, and the Experiences, Group Dynamics and Background of the Participants.Each Game is unique and thus have to be solved in a relatively unique way also. The Pacing, Storytelling, Characterizations, Acting, etc. are all pretty good, there's not a lot of dull moments in the Episodes, there's always something interesting happening.It's just one of those Shows where, once you start watching, you just don't want to stop. Truly a Hidden Gem, it is a Japanese Production, not much Promotion, not much hype, hopefully it won't stay hidden for long. For Science Fiction Fans, this is a Must Watch for me, again one of the Best Series I have seen this Year.",10
East Asia,This show was really good I can't wait for the second season it was crazy like what if this really happened in real life everyone should watch great show !!,10
East Asia,"5 minutes just running, 3 minutes just thinking, 4 minutes just being quite and looking. Some of the games are fun others are just hide and seek with and without guns. MEH. It has potential just wish it wouldn't be so fxking slow. I skipped to the ending and you know.. it's kinda what you expect but nothing more. Season 2 - without me.",3
East Asia,I cannot express how much I loved this show. Every episode kept you wanting to know what crazy twisted thing was going to happen next. We definitely need a second season. Great job netflix.,10
East Asia,"Finally Netflix delivers an entertaining series in another language than english thats worth watching. This series is totally mindblowing, with an element of Escape room in a post-apocalyptic like parallel world. Its based on the Manga series by Taro Aso. And it does it quite good and stays true to the Manga. I highly recommend watching this. Only downside is, that there is only 8 episodes. Plot is nice and just like in the Manga, the main characters is stepping into what seems to be an empty festival, they are greeted by a woman who tells them that they have already ""entered their game"". After clearing the game, she reveals to them that, in Borderland, they must play games to survive. Very entertaining",10
East Asia,"Perfect start and mediocre finish. The intro to Usagi was perfect. However, I feel like they rush this through. I think it needed more marinating. Have a character development, it's hard to like certain characters because it feels like you don't know them. I think great tv shows implement characters to a different standard. For example, Usagi would have been a great antidote to the mediocre performance from the protagonist. I think the mistake they made was rushing this. I like the tv show but it's not something I will say 'omg I can't wait to see season 2.' Unlike Arthdal Chronicles (Korean) which is a must see, I think it is one of the better Japanese survival tv shows out there but for Netflix standards they could have hit a home run but instead they hit a ground rule double on the first season. My honest opinion. My true rating is a 6/10 but I have it 8/10 because some of the low rating doesn't really makes sense.",8
East Asia,"Lately I found myself fascinated with japanese culture and tv, so I knew this show was coming. It surprised me to see the publicity around it and after I watched the show, I understood the amount of money Netflix put in this. I loved the atmosphere, the music and the first 4 episodes. It really looks like another world, with the same buildings and spaces, but empty, on the verge of the survival, with clinical colours. I noticed most of the actors and after I finished the series, I looked for almost everyone of those who appeared in more than 2 episodes. Their acting is different from what we are used to in the western cinema- they are more expressive in sadness and desperation, to the point they may seem melodramatic. Maybe it's a way to compensate the restraint the japanese society usually shows. As I said, I liked most of the actors, especially Arisu's friends - Keita Machida (Karube), cool and lone ranger like, and Yuki Morinaga (Chota), sweet and full of fears, and their chemistry with Kento Yamazaki. As for Yamazaki, he has ups and downs. His scenes in the end of episode 3 are magnificent and memorable, they left me broken, I saw myself in his howls. Then he goes in the end of episode 8, the scene with all the people in the lobby, and something doesn't seem real, it's all rhetorical. In exchange, Tao Tsuchiya should be allowed to do more, talk more, not be just an idealized heroine.
Anyway, I hope they renew the series. It's easy to watch, with a subject that makes you think about it and most importantly, it's a tv show with a soul.",8
East Asia,"I have never watched Anime/Manga, never been interested in them either but I LOVED the series! If you like puzzles, escape room, problem solving, you would love this series! Definitely recommended, hands down one of the best production that aired during Covid period",9
East Asia,"Imawa No Kuni No Alice (Alice in borderland) is one of my favourite manga and when I found out that there was a live action I was happy and sad at the same time because I was afriad of them spoiling this masterpiece but guess what? They haven't!The show is amazing and is definitely one of the best series out there to watch. There are many different aspects from the manga which made it even more entertaining to see!Anyway, give Alice in Borderland a chance, you won't regret it! And also, if you enjoy reading comics, check out the manga, it's awesome!",10
East Asia,"Absolutely superb, a stunningly beautiful well crafted story that's left me wanting more. One of the best shows I've seen this year",10
East Asia,"Really enjoyed it up until the 10 of hearts game, 56 people enter the game, close to 50 people die during the 2 hours of mass murdering, and then there's 30 odd people still standing at the end.Ruined it for me because that's all I could think of during the last game... Would of given it 10/10 if they crunched a few numbers before airing the show",7
East Asia,"I'm usually a bit skeptical with live action adaptation from mangas, but Alice in Borderland surpassed my expectations. I haven't read the manga, so I'm sure how faithful it is to the source material, but as it is on its own, it was brilliant! Sets the tone pretty much straight away, had me on the edge of my seat all the way. Really enjoyed the characters, thought the cast were great! Some really awesome action sequence, good twists and wtf moments. All I'll say it's like Battle Royale x Hunger Games x 28 Days Later. Don't wanna spoil it for you!
Hope you guys enjoy it as much as I did! Peace!",10
East Asia,"I haven't watched many Japanese movies in the last 15 years or so. The commitment to such story arcs I fear may drive off some viewers, but in my opinion they are timed perfectly. The balance between the action and the intrigue doesn't have me reach for my phone to check my email. I look at that as a win since once you've seen enough western television you're more or less likely to feel a familiar rhythm.Now that I've finished this series I can't wait to see the next season.",9
East Asia,Please make season 2. Even as a person who doesn't read the Manga this is interesting and thrilling to watch.,10
East Asia,"Read the excellent reviews and decided to give this a go. Not disappointed, really well done. A bit of mix between CUBE and being inside a video game, but well executed and keeps you gripped. Well worth a watch.",9
East Asia,"Despite the seemingly raving reviews no doubt written by people that would have simply just liked it cause it was japanese and based on a manga I have some faults. The series itself was not bad if you like this kind of battle royal style, genre of film than you will find it a decent watch however there are some faults the CGI is at times awful and there is a general feeling that this series relies more on shock value than it does substance. Which makes me worry about how great in the end it will be as a series we are continuously introduced to characters who we grow some sort of feeling for and then they are killed now don't get me wrong once maybe twice this can put the audience on edge and be thrilling but after a while and at the end of the series I feel like the people left I have no real connection to they seem to just be brought out the wood works with the bare minimum of character plot.",5
East Asia,"Very nice but also brutal Sci-Fi serie.
It's like most Japanese shows very violent and sometimes a bit weird, but it never gets dull.Still has a lot of plotholes and not everything is explained but enough to make another season, too bad it has the potential to become repetitive if they milk it out too far.Give it a go next lockdown, you won't be disappointed",7
East Asia,"Interesting premise, and enjoyable enough, but very rough around the edges. I haven't read the manga so I had no expectations or knowledge of the story or characters. It comes across as a mix of many other well known movies n TV themes. As the series goes on you see less and less of the the puzzles, which to me, was the best part. Lots of continuity/story holes.
Entertaining, but not one I'll be telling friends to watch. Good way to see some of Tokyo city without people and cars.*** oblique spoilers below ***... But that last few eps of S1. Urgh. It's like they gave up on intricate puzzles and any sense of solving anying, or even have the main characters do anything tricky or smart, or hell, even interesting. Just boring pointless violence, interspersed with jammed in flashbacks/backstory. Way too much was introduced with The Beach which seemed unnecessary, and with very little stakes to begin with, not much is gained or lost by all the dying. We still know next to nothing about the game, why they are there, etc.
I'm not even sure I really care to know after finishing S1...",6
East Asia,"I found a lot to love about this - the Lost/Hunger Games/escape room premise is exciting and the show doesn't pull its punches. In the main the game solutions seemed a bit obvious but I guess the idea is that in the adrenaline and disorientation of the situation you wouldn't be thinking straight.
Where I dropped a couple of points was in the execution. Some of the performance in the dubbed to English version was distractingly bad - if I could speak Japanese and watch an undubbed version then it might be different but I can't so that was an issue for me.
It felt to me like it would have benefited from being a 12 or 13 episode series - I think with a bit more time and space we could have got to know the characters a bit better and the series end could have been better developed. The last episode felt a bit thrown together and left a lot to question - in a ""Whut?"" way, not in a cliff hanger way. Plus a minor, but distracting, quibble was that there seemed to be some confusion about how many people were at The Beach.
Those flaws are there and detracted from it a little but I'd still recommend it as an interesting and exciting show to watch and I'm now keen to check out the source material.",8
East Asia,The storyline and everything it's just so well done. It really has you in suspense. I can't wait for season 2 !!!,10
East Asia,"no spoil - I just finished the serie and it was awesome except for the last episode, i was hooked from episode 1 and I recommend this serie to anyone.Until the last episode... Everything was great, the plot was great, the actors were great but everything just went the japanese anime way : way too much useless & dramatic scenes lasting for hours without purpose and making me feel more than annoyed.
I was just feeling like ""come on! just get on with it""
I was so disappointed the serie had to finish this way because the 7 first episode were just amazing. Hope for a season 2!",7
East Asia,This is one of those Japanese gems like a high end Lexus that's been knocked outta the park. The twists are NOT predictable and there is some very original content here! I like to savor shows one episode per day but I'm so tempted to binge!,10
East Asia,"The premise of this series is one which I love so I was very intrigued to watch this series when I saw it pop-up on Netflix.If I had to give it a score after having watched the first 4 episode it would have been a 8/10 for me. However as my score clearly shows something went wrong after episode 4.Personally the second half is when I felt the series starting loosing what was great about the first 4 episodes. Not to go into any spoilers, but it introduces new elements to the story that could be interesting but just feels out-of-place in my opinion. I think it could be done and I don't think it was necessarily horrible, however this is where I started to feel that the story lost its focus.However the big problem with this series is the last 2 episodes. Especially the last one. Obviously since it's the end I can't go into too much detail but what I will say is that story becomes rather ridiculous. And this is something considering what the story really is from the beginning. But it goes from being more of a mystery and figuring out what is happening to just be full-blown action and craziness. Also the acting and dialog becomes very over the top. The big reveal that we get at the end is not really satisfying, it just left me disappointed and mad about the potential this series had.Still I wouldn't call this show bad, im still giving it a 6/10 since the first 4 episodes were great, ep5/6 was okay, and 7/8 was bad, which I average out to about a 6.If you are asking yourself if you should watch this show then I would say that if you like the concept and these types of shows then it's a good bingeable show for a weekend. Since it's only 8 episode it doesn't take too much time to watch it through. But if you aren't feeling it after the first episodes then you can stop since it won't get better from there.",6
East Asia,It's the best thing on Netflix right now. Must watch and I am no manga or Japanese genre fan. A bit slow at the start but I guess narration does require some context unless u jump straight to action but it picks up after that and keeps u hooked till the end. I get why some didn't like the ending since everything until then was excitingly chaotic. But I can't complain and be more excited to watch the second season. Overall it's very entertaining.,9
East Asia,"Narrative - great
Mystery - great
Story - greatCharacters - since this was originally a manga, the characters are written like anime characters
it's not a big problem, but it sometimes feel a little off, but this is just my personal opinion, except that, they are goodShould you watch it - definitly
unless you don't like gore, cause it got some but not too much",7
East Asia,Just wow this show had me on the edge of my seat. Great show to watch!! Cant wait for season 2!!!,8
East Asia,"I really wasn't expecting very much from this show, but it really amazed me. It got my brain thinking and had me trying to solve things throughout each episode. I felt so many different emotions from this show and I cannot wait for the next season. This show was carefully thought out and everything falls together beautifully. The visuals were also amazing along with the character development! I am very critical with what I watch, but this show was binge worthy. Amazing!",10
East Asia,"I'm in love with this series .
I didn't expected it to turn out so good .
With kento awesome acting as usual , this series is 10/10 for me .
The main character and side character all have some kind of past and this game that they are made to play changes themselves , i love how main character uses his brain ( from playing too many games ) .
I wasn't available to predict what going to happen next , so it was fun watching this .",10
East Asia,"Three best friends in Tokyo seem to vanish from thier own world and venture into an alternate reality of some kind, where the normally densly packed Tokyo is abandoned. A dream come true for some(especially during a pandemic), however, the trio soon realize that their existence has an imminent expiration date. All they need to do is play some games to extend their stay. The catch? The games can kill you of course, and there is a time limit(every games worst nightmare). Furthermore, if the games don't kill the loveable trio, then surely the other ""players"" might.Those lucky enough to stumble across ""Alice In Borderland"" will soon find themself very unlucky, when they have binged watched the entire season during one night and crave more episodes. Like other postmodern science fiction films/series such as ""The Matrix"" or ""Battle Royale"", this season brings an element of mystery and confussion that made me want to find out more, what the hell is really going on?Amidst all we get to see pleasing, well made action scenes that takes your mind of the bigger picture. At one point a sword-wielding mad man with face tattoos fights a bikini dressed teenager with drealocks in a club with strobelights(didn't think I would see that, like ever). Survival is of course key in Borderland first and foremost. The games are tricky enough put far from impossible.It's of course easier solving them in the safety of the couch and not betting ones actual life on solving the puzzle. Well written and exciting aspect of the first season.Characters are not fully fleshed out, but this is so far the first and only season. Then again, as you could imagined in this type of dystopian sandbox, people die left and right. With that said my favorite episode was episode 07, the one episode we actually got to see some brief backstory(and also the club fight). My favorite character is so far Usagi(Tao Tsuchiya). I call her ""Mirrors Edge girl"" for reason obivous if you look at her appearance and skills.In conclusion: Great pace, entertaining and fast action scenes. Captivating plot, can't wait for season 2 (please, oh please be a season 2). I really want to see what challenge a ""dressed card"" offers.",9
East Asia,Outstanding is the acting of Yamazaki Kento in this series. The plot moves fast enough to not feel bored and the series theme and idea is unique. I like the survival theme and how interesting the series gets while unfolding. I hope we get to see a season 2!,10
East Asia,I see the one in which the director and screenwriters made this show have that of an archetypal path.I loved its Hunger Games/Maze Runner type feel.The conplexity of the games to then have it looped it to mind games and personal character relationships was fascinating.Great watch - especially with friends.,8
East Asia,Really impressed with the personality and development of each and every character. Happy with the interconnection of each character and their role in each episode. Masterfully tied past with present and set up the settings for each game. Ready for season two!,6
East Asia,Very interestingly built up a game and the concept of the story.,10
East Asia,"Really hope there is a season 2!I love being transported to a different world and Alice is a convincing one too. The acting is great and the camera work is great too. The story is silly but it's also awesome too! If you roll with it, it's a enjoyable ride! The dialogue can be a bit over the top but that's part of manga.
You won't be disappointed with investing your time in this",8
East Asia,"After Game of thrones I did not found my self breathless like this series
It is excellent work",9
East Asia,I didn't think I would enjoy this show so much but I most definitely loved it I hope there will be more seasons.,9
East Asia,This is crazy good. recommend it to anyone who can deal with reading subtitles.,9
East Asia,"Nice idea, but the lousy dialogue and cringeworthy acting finally made me stop. I normally really like Japanese productions, but this was just bad and possibly the most overrated show in a while. Hopefully the rating will balance itself once more realistic ratings come in to counteract all the 10 clickers.So seriously don't waste your time.",2
East Asia,"It's been so much fun in watching the series. Initially I found the series repulsive due to cultural conflict. Then I gradually liked it and started binge watching it after episode 2. Yes, they put too much emphasis on the details of corpse SFX, but that's not a big deal.To me the plot is quite a simple one. The true calling is the concept of coma-in-multiverse. I have to keep thinking and watching and enjoying the thriller at the same time. That's the fun: a 3-in-1 kind of fun.I seldom watching Japanese drama and that's one that I would recommend to my friends.",8
East Asia,"Before it was released, I had been looking forward. However, after I finished 4 Eps, I didn't think it fulfilled my expectation.
Some people's deaths are unnecessarily. The game in Ep 3 is a little boring. It is not interesting, without unexpected turns. It seems that this game is only aimed to kill his two friends and provide him a chance to meet the heroine. However, I don't know why the heroine can survive so long either, as it proves that she is just lucky enough after I finished Ep 4.
But it is still worth watching if you are a fan of thrilling and suspenseful dramas.",7
East Asia,Just now finished watching the series on Netflix and cant get over it. Desperately want a season 2 .Mostly I was star struck by dori sakurada's character as Niragi. At first I couldn't even recognize him. He was so good at acting. My God ??,10
East Asia,"You can tell that this series is based on a manga. It is extremely exaggerated - unfortunately that also applies to clichés and nonsense. In addition, ""Alice in Borderlan"" unfortunately hardly offers any twists or storylines that are not completely predictable or one-dimensional. Unfortunately, from the first to the last second, the whole thing is an unorginal, illogical and often stupid mess that has not worked with comparable formats such as Qube.",4
East Asia,I have never been a fan of Anime . However I love Castlevenia and Blood of Zeus . I was really excited for this show because of its extremely unique plot . It didn't not disappoint . Let's start with the positives . - The acting is really good from every single cast member . - The character development is excellent . - The action scenes are thrilling . - The gore is used right although I wanted a bit more . - The show is extremely addictiveThe ending is great as well . Now the negatives . - The dialogue is bad . - The show in the middle gets a bit boring . - Some CGI effects are bad . So this show is addictive and I really need season 2 now,8
East Asia,"I was inspired by the good user rating, it also started quite well when the actors were suddenly all alone. But already at the end of the first episode you could tell the amateur actors. It got worse and worse from one episode to the next, so from the 3rd episode on I didn't feel like it anymore.",2
East Asia,"The two first episodes is pretty good but then..... Did the writers and directos die after episode two?
To many issues with this tv serie so don't watch it.",1
East Asia,"Alice in Borderland is a story about people being thrown into death games and they obviously try to survive. The concept is not very original and also has been seen in quite a few anime shows as well.Depending on how it is done it can either be pretty entertaining or very dull. When you know that a lot of character may or will die then it often is difficult to build any attachment to them because they might be gone in the next episode.So far in season one the show has done a decent job at least regarding the main characters - one of them being Arisu. By the end of the first season I did somewhat care about him and want him to survive. Usagi as a character is also very likable.Unfortunately for the side characters it's a lot of hit and misses - so resembles a bit of a rollercoaster. Some are decent/good and some you'll forget within the next 10 seconds.The games that are shown are interesting for the most part. Some of them could use better twists though.My biggest gripe is the ""power"" inconsistency though. We're having characters that for example supposedly have been bullied in school because of how weak they were and that don't look physically strong and then suddenly they pull off something completely inhuman like doing a backhand fist slap and through that throwing another character several meter away from them.Also the show tries to provide backstories for the various bad characters to explain why they are the way they are. However it's hard to feel sympathy for someone being punched in the face when said person a minute earlier randomly murdered people and has a great time with that.I'd like to see where the story goes in season 2 and hope they can fix certain problems. Overall it's okay to watch it once. Most probably won't return to re-watch it later though.",6
East Asia,"Not many show has made me cry after 3 episode. This show is raw, brutal and exciting! If you like things like saw, escape room and the walking dead, then you will like this! Highest recommends everyone to watch this show!",10
East Asia,"I think the fact that I hated it so much is because I'm not used to the Japanese acting style. It's so over the top all the time. If you're not into anime you might hate it as well. The script is full of cringe and the screaming is so annoying. Almost unbearable. Good effects, but that's it. I really don't understand the rating to be honest.",2
East Asia,"First of all...we have to remember this is an adaptation to a manga/anime. They respect a Tv Show format mixing some of it with the classic anime character development, background and plot twist style. If you're into Japanese style tv shows and like Japans culture this will be perfect for you. If you're new into Japanese format I'll first recommend watching at least some classic anime films, shows or even reading some manga so you can understand the concept overall and the Japanese industry. This show is full of excitement, nerve wracking moments and even emotionally/heartbreaking moments. A 10/10 and hopefully they release a second season!!! Give this show a chance and enjoy it.",10
East Asia,MADE IT THROUGH 3 EPISODES SO FAR AND ITS STARTING TO PICK BUT MAN I FEEL SO SORRY FOR OUR MAIN CHARACTER AND I STILL HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS I HOPE TO BE ANSWERED LIKE WHAT CAUSED ALL THIS AND WHERE IS EVERYBODY ELSE,8
East Asia,"This is just one insanely dark series! Great storyline, believable actors, and a series that will twist you mind and keep you very captivated throughout the season. I totally recommend it!",9
East Asia,"A thrilling suspense ride through deserted Tokyo streets, featuring engaging character drama, moral dilemmas and impressive set-pieces. Reminiscent of the Hunger Games, in a good way.",8
East Asia,"Most addictive show I've watched all year. Absolutely need season 2 ASAP! Never seen the manga, but i've read they have sticked to it. As long as season 2 super good and they give us a gooood ending -> it has to be one of the best series ever. please, please season 2!!!",10
East Asia,"I Love the TV series with short episode. The appearance of every character in the movie will not easy to determine of what will happen every episode. I love the series the writer to aid with every character, especially the main character of the movie.
A couple of thumbs up.",8
East Asia,"The people in this show act like manga characters, it doesn't work with real people. Too many clichés, one example is games being solved at the last possible second. A guy punches a tiger and somehow is the winner in that exchange.",4
East Asia,Dare you watch the first chapter!! You will enjoy the empty citiy of Tokyo with a lot of surprises!,9
East Asia,"Loved it so much i always like this type of movies and when it comes to Series
it was a big joy for me, well made
can't wait for S02",10
East Asia,"A very nice series that keeps you alert almost all the time. There were two episodes a bit ""lower"" compared to the others. The only reason that I rated it with 9 and not 10 is that it still does not explain two important questions. How did all these people were ""transfered"" to that world and how this technology of lasers and so on was found and by whom. Hoping these questions will be answered in Season 2. If yes, then my review will be changed to 10!",9
East Asia,This story looks like it was written by a 10 year old. A bunch of game stuff heaped on with little to no point. Might appeal to young virgin gamers but certainly not for adults.,3
East Asia,An AMAZING concept but really bad executed. Half way in the story everything turned into something confusing and even boring. To me there were bad decisitions made.,7
East Asia,"Japan did it this tv show is so good i dont even know where to start a must watch for everyone if only there was more shows like this concept, story, action, characters everything is perfect a solid 10 !",10
East Asia,I never thought a live action movie based on animes/manges would be so good. the cast was insane. I really enjoyed all the characters in the Series. Please more live action movies like that......... I wish Death Note Live action was like this.,9
East Asia,I started watching after some reviews must say 3 episodes are really good and absolute thrill to watch if you are gamer it's for you. This series lost its thrill after 3rd episodes it becomes too slow in narrative (except few moments).,6
East Asia,"The plot of the show is very similar to Saw series except this is not created to punish the wrong doers. It's a game of life and death among humanity. Those games are almost insane (imagine if you were one of them!) driving them to make swift decision and the right decision to survive (to win). It's really a game of wits mostly, you need to be calm and have great observations to help you through every stage.Every character seems so suspicious and you really don't have a clue who is going to betray you. You're constantly at the crossroad, trying to decipher the game and it's exhilarating for viewers in my opinion.It's insatiable watching the episodes. You yearned for more, because we are looking forward to seeing the truth behind these games. And to get answers to what happened to these people? Who created them? And most importantly what's the ending?The only reason why I didn't give it a 10 is simply because it's rated R21 but I think the gore and the explicit content isn't suffice. A little nude scene will also add some flavors to the series.",9
East Asia,"I had some reservations about the series as I have never seen a Japanese TV series before. The idea is so original and well-written. It's exciting, intense, and interesting. A group of misfits are transported to a parallel universe where you have to play to survive. The whole world is a play stage. Time to binge now.",9
East Asia,Fantasy...flying girls and so on....nothing for adults...,6
East Asia,"I love animes and mangas but i hate bad adaptations. I don't understand why, when they make these series they are forcing themselves to copy %100 to look like a manga character. Their movements and mimics can't be same exactly like the drawings and yet they try to act like that and it makes everything cringey. If you like the story try reading the manga it is much better.",5
East Asia,I think at first you will see that it will be ok to watch but as you go than you will feel damn this way much better than what I expected and the third episode made me crythat third episode I will never forgetJapan is producing some best content not only in anime now I know,10
East Asia,"I was very pleasantly surprised by this new show that's once you get through the first episode which I watched a dubbed version that also had subtitles which was funny as a lot of what was said was not what the subtitles said!
I found the first episode a little strange and slow but then it is Japanese and so culturally different the3 friends appeared quite childish as in immature in first episode. However the show picks up from 2 nd episode and I found it better to watch with subtitles and not dubbed
The concept is different which makes it an unique show and gripping as I binge watched all 8 episodes
Looking forward to next series I think this will get a lot of positive reviews and be nominated for awards so am confident there will be a season 2",9
East Asia,"The quality of this show puts Hollywood etc to shame! Feels like a live action anime more than any other manga adaptation i have seen before. I know it is based on a manga of the same name but it massively feels like a cross between Gantz and Death Parade which is just a dream come true!The cyber punkesque vibe and music really beef up the atmosphere and actually help make you feel afraid of this city. I went into this not knowing anything about it and hadn't heard of the Manga, it has now made a fan of me and will be treating myself to the manga books at Christmas =)Really hope we get at least another season minimum as this is now one of my favorite shows.",10
East Asia,"It started very well, I like characters, scenes, games and I really wondered what will happen next but when they arrived to beach, everything started to get worse.. And in last episode, it turned kind of hunger games.. Generally it is ok, watchable and different but it finished with lots of questions..it looks it will be second season and I hope we can get the answers.",8
East Asia,"Love the show .... great preformed from all the actors
Hope season 2 is coming soon",10
East Asia,"Some small nice elements and ideas !!!!
But Man oh man..... Way too much crying and weeping at the start, unbearable !!!
Watch CUBE .....much better !",3
East Asia,"Started off just OK despite the insanely over the top acting, which the Japanese are known for, and the sometimes hilarious English dubbing.. After episode 2 everything went downhill fast.. The hilarity of the dubbing only takes it so far.. With episode 3 I'm out...",3
East Asia,"Where everything had started was pretty catchy to be honest, but everything loses its reality with each episode. I did not like the acting that much and some of the dialogs made me laugh due to nonsense.",5
East Asia,"The show is bad from any point of view: casting, total overacting by everyone (maybe this is ok for Japanese acting school but it was really hard to watch what's going on the screen), lack of logic in heroes behavior and script at all. The first time when I regret the time I spend for the show.",1
East Asia,I can't say much without ruining it but I'm on episode 3 and each episode gets better and better those who have seen episode 3 will know exactly what part made me leave this review,9
East Asia,"Absolutely mesmerized by this! The story, the cast, each episode has something that will just keep you coming back for more!
I have not seen anything like it !",10
East Asia,"This is a brilliant show that feels like a true live-action adaptation of an anime. Pacing is great, characters are well-developed, action and CGI is top-notch. Anyone bashing this show is either not into Japanese shows or just jumping on the hate bandwagon. You wanna know why people rate this so highly? Because it is actually that good. Don't listen to miserable people who can't appreciate quality television.",10
East Asia,"Would I recommend? Hell yes. Well yeah this series contains genres and concepts already being done before but guess what? It's entertaining. Though they left the series on a Cliffhanger which is why this isn't a 10. I left the 1 star just in case for the next season. Honestly speaking this was an manga adaptation done right, the budget was definitely good and the cast, directing and everything was smooth. Okay now onto the most criticised part ""The story/plot holes"". Okay so there might've been few mistakes near the end but you gotta understand this stuff is Fiction. I didn't even recognise those plot holes until some yall point it out so Don't hesitate to watch this! For something that ain't even affect the characters. Love how It gets better each episode! Personally I prefer this much better than Sweet Home adaptation.",10
East Asia,"For the begining i would Like to point out that as a beginner in Japanese TV it took half of the show to adapt to some of the specific aspects of their TV. A lot of the acting scenes were in my taste, way over the top and way to melodramatic. Specialy Arice on the end of EP 03. It took me apart from the show and I couldn't enjoy the scenes completely. Maybe it is because I am not used to Japanese TV culture and I know this is a adaptation from manga but scenes like that were constantly annoying to me. The acting was in some scenes Superb, but in the others it was absolutly terrible. It was laughable for me. There is a scene in which Arice explains the diesel fuel and the old motorcycle, and while he explains it, his hands look like he is holding an invisible potato or smth. Absolutly cringe ! You can say that the reason I think that is because I don't understand Japanese culture but I am not the only one saying this. On the other hand, there is plenty to like in this show, hence for my rating. Lets start with the obvious. The music was perfectly toned in my humble opinion and it set up the scenes very well. And I am no expert on music in TV shows but I tend to keep a simple rule. If you don't notice the music that much, that means its good. When I would notice a song in this show, it would be even better. I think everyone can agree on this one Secondly, the camera work was absolutly amazing. So many Great shots of nature, empty city, parks and even regular scenes from specific angles. And I am also amazed with the special effects here. They were much better than I expected before watching. To even think how much they spent on production. Impressive for sure. There is only few scenes where I noticed realy bad CGI, and the most memorable one was the sword-tiger fight in one of the games.
As i am mentioning swords, I remember the fight scene in EP 07 in the disco, if you are not planing to watch the show, at least watch that scene, it is a great, beautifuly filmed short action sequence.
Furthermore, the wrinting is also pretty good. The plot develops consistently through the episodes and it keeps you focused most of the time. Apart from the stuff I mentioned earlier, I realy respect the bold moves and twists the directiors make in the show (EP 03 is the best example). They realy wanted to show us that this is not a fairy tale world where everything ends well, but a serious place with serious consequences. Unlike the fairy tale, the Wolf can sometime win in this world.
And that brings us to games. Winning, playing, living, dying.
That was the main reason I started watching the show, and boy was I not dissapointed. From the first episode, to the last one, games are the main plot of the show. They involve your mind, your body, and your soul(heart). Some of them are easier than others but as a viewer, none of them are cliche easy answer games. Only the quick witted players such as Arice and Chershire (my absolute favourite) can break a hard game, and as a viewer you get the same chance. Visual clues are everywhere but they are not easy to spot in the first viewing. Sometimes I felt like i know all the answers but my theories turned out wrong, but on the other hand, some of my predictions of the plot turned out pin point accurate( I am not mentioning theories im which I failed miserably) .But in the end, when the game is done, the answer usualy feels obvious, but it really requiers a lot of skill. It makes you think, wwId? (what would Lucifer do? Nevermind, only Lucifans will get that joke). But no, seriously it makes you think ""what would I do?"". And the real answer is generaly: i don't know!. It is hard to think and act when your life is on the line, and your friends life too. Those kind of choices and games are this shows main attraction. IT shows you that nothing is black and white and sooner or later everyone gets in the grey zone of moral and ethic, but question is how are you gonna cope with that? Arise seeks revenge, not sure that he will get it any time soon, but let's wait for season 2.
I reccomend !
P.S. Usagi",8
East Asia,"This is like a cartoon written for 12 year olds adapted for live action. I'm sitting here on episode three watching supposedly emotional friends' memories of triple riding a bike through Tokyo, which is cringe at any age and in any script. But these dudes are old enough to sit in a bar and drink beer, which is literally the next scene. This just follows on a long list of Japanese culture stunting the growth of its youth. Is it a wonder that none of them ever date or get married anymore? They're all thinking of riding bikes with their friends at 22 years old? Oof it's just too much. Battle Royale is enjoyable corny with ultraviolence. For this, the violence is much less ultra and waaaayyy more corny. I don't recommend for anyone over 14, seriously. You'll be disappointed in the terrible script like it was written for a high school drama project.",3
East Asia,"Not going to give it away let's just say best interpretation of alice in wonderland I've ever seen!! The characters are all phenomenal. the story line and plot is flawless and the execution of this intense suspense thriller is big budget big time quality I also love the filming in Tokyo. Trust me watch this right now!!! You'll binge it like we did..... 10 solid stars!!!!!!!!! Much respect to the writers director cast and crew, thank you!!!",10
East Asia,"The show in itself is good. It has good acting, scenario and all else but the story between the games does not make sense. They are in middle of Tokyo with a ton of canned food in every convenience store , there is empty houses all alround them and yet they are camping and hunt for food? Else for minor characters no one bother to bring a weapon when going to game, they make little to no preparation.",6
East Asia,"After The Queen's Gambit, this is the only series I finished in one sitting. Gosh everything was just so amazing, the storyline, the cinematography, the actors they're doing amazing job. Thank God Netflix for producing this series, I can't wait for season 2 and how the story will going to be, lot of questions remain unanswered. Hopefully in season 2 we'll find out every thing. MUST WATCH.",10
East Asia,"These series made me watch all 8 episodes in one day , the moment first episode started i found myself immersed in it and with every challenge the protagonists go through you will feel that's it's you who is taking the challenge.
anyway it's not perfect show as there are some flaws espcially for CGI however that won't affect the whole expereince.",8
East Asia,"Like a trash version of the cube, not sure if it's a cultural difference or a bad translation but it lacks any redeeming qualities, poor acting, effects, characters, script, plot and cinematography. Maybe enjoyable if you're a 12 year old or drunk and enjoy so bad it's good, otherwise give it a hard pass.",2
East Asia,I VE NEVER SEEN SUCH AN INTERESTING SEASON . IT HOOKS YOU UP FROM START TILL THE END HIGHLY RECOMMENDED,10
East Asia,"The theme is unique. The story is well developed, well explained and not repetitive . For a tv series , that alone is the most important. Aside from that, acting is on point. Music is ok. But the movie effects and how they created a completely humanless setting wowed me. A really good thriller series.",9
East Asia,"Well planned..directed series.This one is a very good example of how action-manga should be portrayed.Even though the concept is unrealistic and has very little probability of actually happening in the real world,this series really makes us wonder if this could actually happen and makes us question our abilites and what we would do.Definetely a MUST watch.Makes you sit tight and watch the whole thing in one go.Hopefully there's a season 2.",9
East Asia,The actors were bad. The script was full of plot holes. The characters behaved in a frustratingly nonsensical way. The budget was low. It was bad.,1
East Asia,"So I got suckered in by the good rating. Read the reviews and you'll see there's a lot of people giving it 10 after watching 1 episode and saying proudly that they are doing that. Why do these dopes exist?
The 1st 2 episodes are good then it just goes down hill.
As it states it's a Netflix Original, so of course there's now an obligatory Trans person that also of course has to be a hero. I can guarantee you that's not in the original Anime.
But overall it's just boring.
Made up unimportant drama after the 1st 2 episodes give you 6 episodes of boring filler.
Don't waste your time.",1
East Asia,"The first five episodes were decent. Some 'unnatural' parts were tolerable by keeping in mind this was originally a graphic novel.The final three episodes were painful to go though and were terrible. The flaws include: actions that are not believable, flashbacks or scenes that are being repeated in the exact way, unnecessary flashbacks (for minor characters), unnecessary fight scenes (between minor characters).The quality of the final three episodes made me drop two stars from what I would have rated the series based on the first five episodes. Overall, the story contains a lot of murder, is not very deep or inspiring, and is not a must watch.Maybe you can watch only the first five episodes, but the story does make you curious what happens next.To give you an idea of my taste: some of the TV series or movies that I love are 'The OA', 'Sense8', 'Beastars', 'Dark', 'Arrival', and 'Interstellar'.",6
East Asia,"This movie might be more for the gamer, manga, younger crowd if you want to stay glued for all episodes. I am with rdvljunk, and started losing patience and rolling my eyes with the beach activities. Plenty of beautiful Japanese women for those who appreciate that.",5
East Asia,"Excellent, big Thanks authors and actors who have been working on the serial",10
East Asia,"Karube died too early!!! I'm so touched by the friendship of the three, Karube only died so that Alice would take the survival game seriously? Karube can be more useful if he's saved for later, at least wait till episode 6...",9
East Asia,"I love this show! I've been watching it all day long, I would totally recommend it and I'm hoping there will be a season 2 because it was that great!",10
East Asia,"The series felt like a justification for otakus who thinks one day they'll save the world with their gamer power.Still it was a pretty fun watch, if you can bare the overly edgy characters, ridiculous plots, and a story that makes wtf sense.",4
East Asia,This was a fast paced story that will hold your interest. You really care about the lead characters. Excellent dark storyline with interesting characters. I hope this gets a second season because it is a great binge! Watch and enjoy.,10
East Asia,"I'm glad I gave this a shot, it's such a great concept. I loved every game they played. I watched this all in one day and I'm going to watch it again with my girlfriend this time on the weekend!",10
East Asia,"Typical japanese production: overacting, silly overeaction, useless info dump, lame scientific explainations, illogical world building that can never work, mystery box writing, over sexualisation in the worst possible situations, women as props and men as dickheads, typical villians and heros, lame twists, mindless violence...all the worst traits of a typical japanese show, you will find it here. Only people new to the Battle Royale genere, or those who have never read any manga will enjoy this.",1
East Asia,It started off good and the idea behind it is somewhat interesting but the show gets boring really fast. Aside from bunch of cute teenagers running around which should attract people in the same age category this show really has nothing else to offer. I really don't get all the high ratings ....,2
East Asia,Don't miss this amazing webseries it is really very amazing webseries. Can't wait for season 2,8
East Asia,There are only few really good japan series to watch but this one might be a breakthrough for japan movie industries,10
East Asia,"Its like a very good anime transformed into a real life
I cant wait for the next season",10
East Asia,"The series which is redone from the Same named Anime shows that Animes can be redone as a none animated Series. After Death Note was such a bad remake, Alice in boarderland surpasses all expectations that an Anime Fan could have. The Story itsself goes beyond the Anime and doesnt Leave the viewer behind. It hab's high chances of giving you a Short Night with their really interesting content which is Build by a Game every episode while the mainstory keeps on going, so that there is no Filler.
The whole Series was an unexpected Highlight during corona and leaves the viewer with just searching when the 2nd season is about to Start.
For me a 9/10!",9
East Asia,As always with Japanese inspired manga and anime it's high concept that is sort of out the box or interesting which then gets worse as the series goes on . Much like Japan sinks 2020 they have a good start that inspires curiosity. As it gets further in the dialogue and decisions fall off to the ridiculous. E.g and office worker who will stop at nothing to survive but despite knowing what she must do opts to wear heels for games she might have to run in.. ok . But back to the rest the strange cult idea could be plausible but would people really act how they are or have the food to do it. Just odd decision making as usual. Much like the way sword art online goes from thriller esk scenario to odd plot lines that shouldn't have been there . Sadly I know they just keep producing this stuff,6
East Asia,"This show starts good enough, intriguing, it leaves you hanging for what is to come. This is for the first two episodes, after that you can see clearly it lacks depth, characters are weak, they are not likeable. The series was based on a manga and there are moments where it feels like you're watching some kind of budget anime with real people. Flashbacks to some characters lives that bring nothing new to the table there is absolutely no reason for them to be shown. Special effects lack quality at times, and the show gets dull and you feel like there is nothing they can do anymore to save it at some point. It ends aiming at a second season but I feel like I had enough with this one.",5
East Asia,It's a one of a kind. I loved it from beginning to end.,9
East Asia,"This is a fun filled Christmas melodrama with gratuitous drama, crazed plot and over the top, did I say over the top, acting and melodrama. Every line delivered is soooo way over the top that it is hysterical.The femme-androgynous cast is good to look at and the action fun.
Don't look for logic or reason.Escapist entertainment.",6
East Asia,"Arisu Ryohei is unemployed and spends most of his time playing video games. One day he meets up with two friends in the middle of Tokyo. After some mild hijinks they hide in a cubicle in a public lavatory... suddenly the lights go out and they can no longer hear the general hubbub of the busy city. They emerge to find the city empty. Not long afterwards signs lead them to a building, where they are joined by two girls. Here they are forced to play a deadly game, after which they are awarded a playing card. It emerges that they will be forced to take place in such games on a regular basis. Later we are introduced to Usagi, a skilled climber, who later joins up with Usagi. They gradually learn more about the games and what the cards signify while trying to discover if there is a way back to their previous lives.I really enjoyed this series; little time is wasted with set-up; the viewers are thrown into the action along with our protagonists. We know as little about the world they are in as they do and only learn more as they do. Early games make it clear just how dangerous this world is; just because a character is introduced early does not guarantee their survival. The scenes within the games are very tense, and frequently quite gory; there is also a fair amount of fan-service as characters wear beachwear in later episodes for reasons explained in the series. The way the dynamic between the characters changes is interesting; especially after our surviving protagonists find a location with many more players. The cast, both main and secondary does a solid job making the fantastical situation believable. The effects are mostly good but a couple of times the CGI is a bit obvious. As the final episode ends many questions are answered but more are raised; these people's problems clearly aren't over... hopefully there will be at least one more season.These comments are based on watching the series in Japanese with English subtitles.",8
East Asia,It's entertaining with good character development.,7
East Asia,"Alice in Borderland (2020)
Alice in Borderland is a survival game live action series which is amazingly done. A common topic that every manga/anime adaptation into live action fails. I mean none of them have been grate so far... This is the best wr've been given.
So many different things to look forward in each episode with unexpected twists.
Binge watched the whole season.
Highly recommended for manga/anime lovers out there.
#Netflix",7
East Asia,"This started off great but each episode just takes ages to get into it so I've knocked off 1 point, but it is brilliant so far and I'm up to the 'distance' episode.",8
East Asia,"A lot of people die and at some point it gets to be so often that it is repugnant. But that's the whole point of the show. And the kid, Chota cries every ten seconds. His voice is also kinda annoying. And I was kinda happy he got the boot. Those are my gripes. Other than that it's interesting and probably a better manga adaptation than most.",7
East Asia,"It starts with a really interesting plot and also the characters are intriguing. The Japanese way of story telling is appealing although from a western perspective one is not used to it. Also the side topic of gender roles is fitting into it.Having said that the show delivers spectacular bad twists, character developments and acting. It's so weird to watch and painful but I really wanted to see the end of the show.Unforgettable the ridiculous fight against that cougar, the march back with bike all in the same time, the main characters always thoughtful games whereas others fight animals, the incapability of just killing this Aguni and so on... it's just so bad.Why did the girl revealed that she was the dealer? How did that help anybody? And then she died. Great job. And what about those cards. Where were they coming from and did they actually needed the cards? And why is everyone young and the girls always in bikinis?",5
East Asia,"This just came up in my Netflix queue as a recommended show to watch. It's a killer show. Lots of action, drama, and terrific musical score. While I am not really into manga I could see how this could easily translate into a movie storyboard. What I loved about the show is that each main character has a backstory that is often touching. The ending has a nice twist and hopefully, there will be a Season 2 - as we leave Arisu and his girlfriend Usagi poised to face more challenge in this hellish dystopian world. Seriously I fell in love with this nail-biting drama and I highly recommend it.",10
East Asia,"Japan can make good series too.
Waiting for season 2",10
East Asia,"This series started quite well. Although not very original, the premise is intriguing and it kept me watching and enjoying for the first 3 episodes. After that apparently, a 10 years old boy took over the script and the episodes became ridiculous...Some big flaws in the final episodes: 1) Arisu could have never joined the final game since he did not register in time 2) We hear that there are 58 participants for the final game when we see hundreds of people on the beach 3) Arisu gets kicked and punched all the time but somehow the brutal guys kill everybody but never manage to kill him at the beach",6
East Asia,"This series was definitely overrated. Speaking of the scenes, fine, it looks high-budget effects especially the killing scenes. HOWEVER, those games are totally not making sense as a brainstorming series and it seems like only the main character count come up with a unique and no rule-related solutions. Good to emphasize their friendship but if it's nothing to do with the game, DON'T even waste time digging that deep. Generally the speed was too slow.",5
East Asia,A very entertaining and fun to watch TV show and a good example of a well-done live action show. The atmosphere feels close to the manga and there are some interesting turn of events. Looking forward to season 2,8
East Asia,"I just watch the entire tv show!
Full of good ideas, close to the movie CUBE and evolve on his own way very fast.I do not know who are the writers of this tv show, BRAVO !A very serious, dark, well filmed / acted tv show, you absolutely need to know.
Netflix just renew for a season II yesterday ""very good news""!",9
East Asia,"...as they deserve to get my conribution.Honestly, one of the shows i couldn't finish to bingewatch, they better outdo themselves with season 2 and give Battle Royale a run for its money ;).
A well deserved 8/10 so far.",8
East Asia,"Loved this. Fun, action packed and totally entertaining.
I really like this kind of concept, which was first explored in the Cube Trilogy of movies.
This looks like a really fun ride so far.",10
East Asia,"The first two episodes were fine. They can grap your attention. However, the rest is really confusing. They did not explain how they ended in this world and why they play the games.
The first 4-5 episodes were boring. You only watch people playing games. And then the catastrophy was the beach part. Really very bad. This is a great example of bad writing. The beach idea is really desperate.
The characters are not likeable and you can feel they are not real. The director insisting over and over that people are willing to sacrifice thier life for others are not real and become annoying.",4
East Asia,"Japan seems to like the game theme, and "" Alice in Borderland "" nailed every aspect of it. From the suspense to the gore, the drama had it all. Fortunately, that all didn't include romance, at least not yet.Having not read the manga, and watching the drama with no prior experience of the Alice in Borderland universe, it wasn't hard to get introduced to the story and smoothly enter the gaming mode. The drama does a great job introducing each character and their background stories, blending them well with the main mystery about who's behind everything and the individual games the players were asks to play. The extra plotline with the 'Beach' and the strategies that the characters were ploting was another suspenseful factor that added a lot to the main entertainment of the drama.As for the performances, everyone did a great job with their characters and were enjoyable to watch. Some of the actors were acutally unrecognizable!Finally, the CGI were spot on and didn't ruin the whole experience.So, overall, 9 out of 10.",9
East Asia,"After watching this show, I said to myself ""this feels like watching an anime"". And lo and behold, I found out later it was actually based on a manga/anime series. Honestly, I thought the show started out really strong but got a bit meh by the end. The first few episodes have a really nice atmosphere and sense of not knowing what the heck is going on, but by the end so many characters are introduced and secrets are revealed that it's just like ""oh, ok"". It also has all the typical cliche characters you are used to seeing in every anime ever, like the dorky but smart kid, the eccentric party guy, the sadistic goth lolita chick, and sadistic right-hand killer dude, you get the idea. Still not a bad watch.",7
East Asia,"The first two episodes are kind of worth it. After that, it just feels lackluster, not so entertaining, and attention-grabbing. The backstories of the characters are not always that necessary and sometimes even cut scenes that are of interest, looks like a collage. As it progresses it loses more and more, it becomes a violent battle between the rational and the irrational, totally expectable. The conclusions at which the main character reaches are also not so perceptive and well explained as in the beginning, it becomes more about humans than about the game. That's why in my opinion, is not some groundbreaking work. Mainly because it can be compared with so many other great works with a similar dystopian story that are so much better.",6
East Asia,"I've never read the manga so I can't compare that to this, but THIS was an amazing show. This concept was unlike any other show I've watched before. I loved many of the characters and how they use their individual strengths while playing the games. This was also my first Japanese drama and I was not disappointed. Overall, a thrilling drama that I easily watched in two days.",9
East Asia,"Loved it. Def recommended. Once you past a bit over-dramatic acting (usual for japanese cinematography), you will find that games are incredibly interesting and witty, there are some super-cool characters and visuals are great. Series will keep your attention all the way. Cant wait for the season 2.",10
East Asia,"Wow I like it so much I finished on two days
First it's anew idea and a lot of crazy deadly games
I well wait for the second episodes I hope it well be great like the first one with new idea
Actors are good after I saw this one sure I well looking for new Japanese sires
Thanks",9
East Asia,"I went through this series very quickly, and totally enjoyed it. Like others have pointed out, it is a quirky series.",8
East Asia,"Okay the ten star ratings are a joke, the series itself wasn't bad but it had a lot of good and bad points.
Episode's 1 & 2 were really good.
Episode's 3 & 4 were slow and I nearly turned the series off.
Episode's 5 & 6 again were really good.
Episode's 7 & 8 were disappointing.
So really a series of hits and misses, I am glad it was only for 8 episodes otherwise it would have dragged on and on.
The cgi was laughable as we're some of the scenes such as the bus scene.
As for the scantily clad girls, have a meal.",5
East Asia,"This is a completely different genre for me so I'm going to give it justice. The first two episodes started off reall strong. However, I skipped all the middle episodes to see how the games were played out. Honestly I wasn't that interest in the backdrop of all the characters though some of them added to the story line.There are several questions still unanswered for me. Why did all the people disappear? We're they transported to a different reality? It seems so.I didn't follow the logic of the last episode, I couldn't genuinely believe that a person would want to kill everyone because their friend died.Looking forward to the next season but it really has to build on the world building element of this dystopia to keep it interesting and I think the show could tailor more to international audiences.From a cinematography perspective I loved the blueish look and feel at the start and some of the rooftop blue sky shots. However, they also experimented with the orange tinge as well which was nice to view - the cast is primarily East Asian so the colour grading was adapted to bring out the skin tones.I think the show also had lots of subliminal themes eg several plots focussed on suicide, female characters had nurturing roles etc.This was a unique show, it's brought this genre to the mainstream Netflix viewers and we'll have to adapt to this different kind of story telling.",8
East Asia,"Because those who rated this series 10/10 have only watched the first two or three episodes. Honestly, this would have been far better off if it had ended after the third episode, with Arisu heading into the unknown. It's almost like they hired a completely different scriptwriter for episodes 4-8.Seriously, save yourself 5 episodes' worth of time and don't watch beyond episode 3.3/10 for the first three episodes, and I'm being very generous for the third...",3
East Asia,"The idea is great. The writing was reasonable to some extents.
My mains two issues:
1- They could use a better actor for the main character - I felt the overacting with his screams. He didn't touch my feelings at all.
2- A lot of useless flashbacks in the last few episodes for minor characters which bored me.",8
East Asia,"It starts very well with the first three episodes, but then it gets more and more stupid.
5/10 only",1
East Asia,Highly recommended!!! You're missing the best show if you haven't watch this yet. They did an excellent job for making this. Waiting for the next season.,10
East Asia,A really great idea that suffers from overly long scenes of monologuing and silence without purpose. There were plot holes and characters solving puzzles by connecting dots that made little sense. For the budget could have been great but as is was just decent.,4
East Asia,"This is a great show, original with a good cast . each episode gets you in . the actors fit the show greatly and the production is good. Up there as one of the best series in 2020",8
East Asia,"Expecting some exciting mystical stories in the ultra-modern backdrop from the Land of the Rising Sun, I did not expect this to be just another series of the old but well known Japanese torture game show. The only difference being now equipped with smartphones and hi-tech gadgets. The fact that the people in the show aren't really tortured like they were in the reality shows, a lack of logic or any coherent plot line, are the reasons it failed to hold my attention beyond 3 episodes. So it was an early sayonara for me.",1
East Asia,This movie plays with your emotions and does it so well. The story line had me hooked. I feel the 3rd episode was the best and so sad when Arisu's friends died :'(,9
East Asia,If you desire to switch your brain off from this miserable time we are having at the moment then this série is for you.,8
East Asia,I couldn't stop watching it haven't had a show grip me like this in a while. I'm sad it's over. It was kinda like hunger games on steroids. Really good,8
East Asia,"I just can't describe how beautiful some scenes are. Brilliantly done, I must say.
Some of the back stories of some characters like Ann who is trans also made the characters experiences more realistic.",10
East Asia,It's obviously an anime type show with real people. The dialogue is cringe and and the scenarios are ridiculous and not even in a fun way. The ending sucks as well.,6
East Asia,"This series is worth watching , will never feel you bored guanteed",9
East Asia,"It is fun to watch new tv series but with some negative things that I couldn't give more than 6/10.Storytelling is so slow especially while people are talking that even urges you to watch in 2x speed without missing anything.There are very few original ideas here that if you like Saw series (especially the first one), Battle Royale, Cube series..etc you'll just watch another example of these without anything new. Only difference here is some blending of those with anime and action. But especially martial arts scenes are not satisfying enough that couldn't reach my expectations.",6
East Asia,"I love Japanese drama, i know they act differently with different culture also, so, I am really enjoying this story, acting and so on. The story is smart, eventhough personally for me to many skin show and yea Its mystery thriller and too many dead and blood seen also, but its fictional movie right (and 18+ also) so watch it properly, somehow I only focus to the story and I think Its really original, thirlls, entertaining like watching hunger games without knowing who's the enemy (until the last eps). Can't wait for season 2.",10
East Asia,"Season 2 could improve the overall score of the series.
It's good just not ""deep"" enough.
Acting is below average from the young actors.",6
East Asia,"Sure, the series echoes elements of the BATTLE ROYALE and GANTZ franchises, but this obviously happens with the manga comic it is based on, so there is no need to complain. Young people are transferred in an empty Tokyo and participate as players in twisted games, from which they either survive by all costs or die. The story takes some nice twists and turns and the eight episodes have a solid direction from veteran Shinsuke Sato (THE PRINCESS BLADE, I AM A HERO, BLEACH etc.), so they will keep fans of Japanese weirdness (for example directors like Takashi Miike and Sion Sono) happy and satisfied. Plenty of violence, gunfights, katana slashings and girls in swimsuits as well, so what more could someone want?",8
East Asia,"This show blends action, drama and thrills together is a great way. The characters are likeable and easy to empathise with. The action scenes are pretty well shot and there are some great memorable fight scenes. Check this one out if you're a fan of survival games or action dramas.",8
East Asia,"This is based on a manga and it shows, so if those sensibilities aren't for you, you might want to skip it. Otherwise, the plot is captivating, the characters are interesting, and the twists and turns make for really great entertainment. I was genuinely surprised almost every episode. I'm so used to thrillers and anime/manga that I would get frustrated by how obvious the next plot point was and found the pacing exhausting because it was so predictable--except I was dead wrong every single time. I eventually had to accept this was a unique series and I couldn't guess what would happen next. It felt very fresh and exciting.I started the manga after finishing season 1 and was surprised to realize I think the show is better in many ways. The things I didn't like about the show, such as awkward pacing, can be attributed to the manga's flow and other predictable difficulties when adapting 2-D to 3-D. However, the show also brings a lot of the manga to life. The soundtrack, fight scenes, death scenes, and very solid acting really put this series over the top.Can't wait for Season 2!",8
East Asia,"Interesting but the special effects are very cheap and low budget. Disappointed as usual by Netflix and their cheap shows, I'm serious u guys, don't expect good effects, they tried but failed miserably",4
East Asia,I see quite a few people give a bad review because of the nonsensical plot particular towards the end at the beach. I also see it right now. But when I watched the show it was all fascinating and I just ignored all those flaws. This is no doubt a super attractive show that caught yours eyes. I guess all shows have their flaws especially those describing something unreal. Such shows are intrinsically nonsensical. It is for this reason I'd give it a 9 out of 10 even though it has all those flaws. I have to say the review system has flaws in itself.,9
East Asia,"A TV series which is both entertaining and meaningful. I watched it dubbed and in original audio, 50/50, appreciating both for their quality. The storyline is good, but what is great is the effort the show creators have put into translating an ""anime isekai"" kind of story into a TV series. For that alone, but not only, it's worth watching. Acting is good, cinematography and sound are good also. My suggestion: if you wanna taste something different, tasty nonetheless!, you can definitely go for it!
I surely hope to see a second season.",8
East Asia,"Defy logic and bad acting. The first few episodes are fine, but it goes down to drain as the show goes on.",1
East Asia,"I am giving this 5/10 is only because of the first two episodes. The first two episode was so great and it always kept me at the edge of my seat. But starting from episode 3, it loses its spark. The series went downhill after that. The series became cringey, boring and illogical. I will still wait for season 2 just because i love this type of genre.",5
East Asia,This is so good. i cried so much on episode 3... the games are all so cruel but also interesting given you need to think super fast with very little time and you can't afford to make a mistake because it will cost you your life... wow i could never. and i just can't help but love chishiya!!! he's the smartest one who doesn't really care about other people.... idk i just love him. definitely a must watch!!,10
East Asia,"I was very impressed with this series. I wasn't expecting to like it but was gripped by the story. Excellent acting , amazing cinematography and beautiful music.",10
East Asia,"Read the manga and you'll see how bad the acting, it cannot fully develop the emotions, but still, it's good live adaptation in terms of sfx etc.Moreover, the manga shows a lot of character backstory and games.",9
East Asia,Worth your time if you can handle all the crying and people being chased by people with guns (but that keep forgetting to pick up dropped guns after they hit them over the head). Definitely a lot of cringe worthy scenes that make you wonder where the adults were in charge of writing and producing this. It gets better toward the end but bogs part of time on last bit.,6
East Asia,"Until about half way it starts off all mature and exciting, I liked the tone and the characters. Albeit a little slow it had got off to a good start. Then the plot and acting became all childish (unnecessary yelling and crying, over the top sadism). The plot was not longer enjoyable as the focus was no longer any of the main characters as there were too many of them.",4
East Asia,"This show has it good moments, but certainly also its worst. The first two episodes start really interesting but as the show progresses it becomes worse. You sort of follow the main character arisu, and he plays his part okey, but the show fails to build up an emotional connections to the other players. If they die, they die, but the show clearly tries to push dramatical and sentimental moments who are just not there. The most disappointing is the end, you sort of hope you as the viewer are getting information about what happened, why are they in the game world, where are all other people, but there is just nothing.. The viewer who watches the final has as much information as when you started in episode 1... Very disappointing.",6
East Asia,"Firstly i wanna say i'm not familiar at all with the japan culture and comics etc. A friend told me to watch the show and that it was based on a comic book. Thus, I was not really eager to watch it at all. My wife insist on watching it. That was it. The show is really fun and easy to watch, the plot is interesting (but with lots of issues) the scenery is nice. The one thing that really annoyed me at first was the over-acting of the main characters but I realized that this is the way japans actors act occasionally and it's part of the whole movie culture. As a whole it's a show with a lot of suspense and i'm really happy that a second season is going to be released.",7
East Asia,"The setting is what is to be expected from a manga and I need to admit that this the best part of this show, it's interesting and kind of fresh. But that's it already.Anything after episode 2 doesn't make any sense at all. And it's not that the protagonists magically wake up in a strange real world computer game adaptation, this setting offers so many possibilities, yet the show fails everywhere.Any human interaction is totally unbelievable, the decisions they make are totally unrealistic, the dialogues are wooden and off set, the acting is poor, no character development. Also the whole way the story unfolds is so unrealistic, so many plot holes, contradictions, that if you are a slightest of a rational person you will constantly stay in disbelieve and think <<Why, Why, Why ...>>.",3
East Asia,"I have rarely watched something so poorly written and acted. The plot might have had interesting premises but had no solid background / explanation and lazily developed into a complete nonsense.I have the feeling the authors wanted to throw elements in it just for the sake of doing it: they did not even felt the need of clarifying anything to the viewers - many questions were simply left unanswered.Characters' decision-making is often illogical, if not completely random. Some scenes are utterly ridiculous (can you imagine teenagers chasing cars on foot over a long distance?) and, as other already pointed out, acting is incredibly cringy.I watched it until the end only to check if it gets better. And no, it doesn't.",3
East Asia,"The first 3 episodes are really good. But from there on, its all downhill. The concept is great but there are just too many plotholes and bad story telling. Nice to watch if you dont want to think. I personnally would love to be more mindblown watching the series.",6
East Asia,"Perfection is what it is. Despite the obvious fact that I will be one of those who will die from the first game, I really enjoyed it. Series that focus mainly on intellect as its driver usually come up great and this one was a gem. A must watch for anyone looking for something outside the box.",10
East Asia,"If you get tired of OP characters in non-existent peril with Netflix's US productions, this one will fix that for you. After we watched several episodes my son walked away shaking his head and said, ""I'm going to go read All Quiet on the Western Front"" to cheer myself up.It's pretty darn good. A couple of the games had some holes in them, and some of the character behaviors didn't make sense outside of it's what the writers wanted them to do at that moment. But really watching this is more about feeling like the last year wasn't so bad compared to what these characters are going through. Hoping Season 2 can keep pace.",8
East Asia,"The first episode is indeed very gripping and introduces a hope.
The hope that the next episodes will be an escalating display of clever riddles and conclusions. A hope so strong that the viewer is willing to accept the mediocre acting.Unfortunately the show doesn't choose this path. Instead we are fed with b-movie action and thriller sequences till the very end of the first season.
Furthermore we are left with a feeling that nothing really happened ... besides the first 3 episodes.In conclusion: A good concept, with some great atmosphere, ruined by a wrong script path and bad acting.",7
East Asia,"If you loved Independence Day despite the infinite problems and plot holes, then this is in a similar fashion. If you dont want to think too hard this is quite enjoyable. The unknown keep the story moving along nicely. The 'games' are the star of the show. They make you want to solve them. I mean in E8 how many people spent a lot of the time wondering who the 'witch' was. If you did then this show was made for you.",8
East Asia,"Some episodes are better than others, with many scenes that are obvious filler. That being said, it's still a good watch and has characters you care about.",7
East Asia,"I haven't read the manga, so I can't really comment on its accuracy to the source material (although I'm of the opinion that even major changes are fine as long if they serve the director's vision)
This director really knows what he's doing. The show is a worthwhile watch for anyone who enjoys suspenseful thrillers with a heap of action thrown in for a pretty penultimate climax.
The twists are set up and executed well, and the motivations and backstories of the characters give even the most despicable characters a layer of depth the viewer can empathize with. Sato utilizes information about the characters and story masterfully, doling it out just enough so the viewer understands what's going on, while withholding the rest to make for an engaging viewing experience.
The cinematography is absolutely excellent. Framing, composition, blocking, lighting: all of it is utilized incredibly well to create some absolutely stunning filmmaking.
I will say that it can be a bit of a tough series to get into upon first viewing. The first episode meanders a bit, and the acting can get pretty overkill. The first time I tried to watch this I ended up just putting it down halfway through the first episode because the acting was just a bit too overbearing for my taste. However, once the actual story begins and the characters are thrust into the games, the show drastically improves on the pacing.
Additionally, someone unfamiliar with the nature of manga/anime might have a hard time suspending their disbelief enough to watch through all 8 episodes. The characters all end up screaming each other's names at one point at the top of their lungs in some dramatic fashion (which got kind of cringe for me sometimes), and the last three episodes are extremely shounen in nature, with absolute balls-to-the-walls action and what seems like 5 different shadowy organizations plotting against one another, each more powerful than the last.
However, this series definitely has a lot of heart, and there are some incredibly emotionally intense episodes (Ep 7 is a standout for me), coupled with some very well choreographed action, and well directed suspense. This series is certainly an emotional rollercoaster, with me equally cheering for the characters and sobbing my eyes out more times than I can count. It is definitely worth a day spent just bingeing the whole thing.",7
East Asia,The acting & filming was fine. The lack of rhyme or reason made me not care. I gave up near the beginning of episode 2.,3
East Asia,"It's only 8/10 up till EP2. Then it goes downhill for me. Overall, it brings down the average to 6/10, maybe even 5/10 from me.
Ep2 was my favorite. I was so scared I had to pause multiple times to get through the episode. I just couldn't. The sight of being hunted down by a masked psychopathic armed lunatic with calm and controlled demeanor was utterly terrifying. That's like my worst nightmare.
Anyway, the whole setting is utter nightmare. This is like the definition of hell for me. To be forced into participating into a game of strength, intelligence, betrayal, and wits again and again with the threat of death by laser that never misses. Incredibly stress inducing scenario. I was having anxiety in the first 2 episodes.",8
East Asia,"Netflix series are always hit and miss with a few gems in between (at least for me).
Therefore Alice in Borderland looked to me like a dumbed down action serie with a lot of drama for ""depth"".
Well... I was totally wrong. Every episode was intense with good action and story driven drama. Especially the latter is really important to me because a lot of series have drama without any goal to it.
If you like a bit of over the top action/gore, a weird plot and story driven drama, this is the next Netflix serie you should watch!",9
East Asia,"It's no cinematic masterpiece, but it'll keep you at the edge of your seat and keep you coming back for more. If you want a good anime adaptation, this is it.",9
East Asia,This show does a fantastic job on creating a spin on the massively popular Japanese game called kings game. The jist of the game is that the king (game master) passes orders to the players who then have to complete those orders under a set time frame. There's a variety of different types and rewards the players based on their difficulty. Thrown into this unknown world Arisu and his friends try to make sense of everything and try to find a way home. The challenges that they face are sure to interest and move you to your core with something newly interesting around every corner. This is a definite recommended for me.,8
East Asia,"People rating this 10/10 need to watch some good or even average stuff to raise their standards a bit. This is bad, like wrose that live Avatar movie. Avatar was pretty good compared to this.
You are shown 3 deliquent who do not care about life, no backgroud story, thurst into a game that will make no sense at times, and the way they solve these puzzles is stupid, clues like length of car that they saw before. So who ever made these riddles/puzzles with clues, needs a paycut. They totally forgot about character growth and background story, why am I supposed to care for these people when all I know is , lady is an cold blooded adulterer who has sex for no reasons, the blond guy looks like a stick but apparently is popular and is a fighter, nerdy guy is a crier and the loser video gamer who cares nothing about life is all of a sudden Albert Einstein.
After some episodes, you will forget to care about any of these flaws because it becomes totally absurd with beach and bikins.
A friend of mine suggested it to ke thinking it was Korean like Kingdom but Japanese acting, dialogues felt pretty bland.",3
East Asia,"No character development, background story, rare filmsy and meaningless sex scene and flashbacks, made no sense, looks like bad live anime adaptation that no one asked for. Boring too. Acting is bad. People praising it must be Attack on Titan live movie fans lmao
This series makes Live avatar movie look good.",3
East Asia,"Nice acting, nice production, horrible pacing, don't know if the story is good because I couldn't go past episode 4. If you saw Saw, or The Cube - and liked them - then you'll probably enjoy this.",5
East Asia,"If you like escape rooms and Saw then you will love this!For the uninitiated that means shock and ingenuity in abundance together with an overarching mystery and sense of being manipulated by a malevolent mastermind. Also, the inspiring (or escapist) sense in which dropouts (or just ordinary people) can, given the right circumstances, become remarkable people whilst others fail.Engaging characters with existential angst. What is there not to love!Dubbed rather than subtitled but done well with excellent voice-artists.I am not familiar with the original manga but am inspired to look it up",10
East Asia,"I couldn't stop watching!
Finished the whole series in one day",10
East Asia,"Let's make it clear, it won't appeal to everyone. This is not an easy watching show, first because of the violence of the theme and second because of the culture of the Japanese culture.For those would stand the first and like the second your are up for a hell of a good time. This is pure madness of a alternative dimension where some inhabitants of Tokyo are send to play deadly games where the only reward is just the possibility to live a few days more. Expect lots of gruesome deaths and plot twists that will keep you want for more. The caracter development is excellent and you may even fell sad when some people die (mention to episode 3)It is true that the show does not give many answers but you get a cliffhanger that will you want for more.A must for binge watching during a weekend",9
East Asia,"At first you would think it is cheesy but then you would look deep into your own soul and say... yep that is me, that is my neighbors, that is my colleagues, that is just like my boss that is just like my veteran friend, the characters really do a good job portraying its weaknesses and that is a sigh of relief, way too many make believe movies out there and this one helps to bring it home where reality meets fantasy. Now the fantasy part.... I do not know where to F&^cking start... good luck in figuring it all out because it is a complete mystery! Good for them because that is the golden calf of this show!",8
East Asia,"Read plenty of recommendations and saw screenshots and this show looked beautiful with an intriguing premise.i could only get 25 minutes in. the boys are obnoxious, the dialogue is kinda stale, too many cliche lines. acting is equally obnoxious and just didnt hook me right. could be wrong but i dont see it getting to a place where its watchable to me, sorry",2
East Asia,"Well, the idea was very interesting and hooked me. Also the whole production looks pretty neat and was possibly made with a good budget. Already in the first episode you could unfortunately also see the problems of the show. The acting is so over-the-top at times that you cannot take it seriously. They completely ignore show-don't tell and over-explain every possible emotion that they are currently having. Then, with the beach plot, it goes off the rails. The characters become even more like caricatures, especially the evil ones. Probably for the teenage audience, the almost entirely young and hot members of the beach can only run around in bikinis. Then, the game in the beach makes everyone go completely crazy shooting everyone without asking why. You have flashbacks explaining why everyone is like they are now, which is sometimes hilarious. That dude sitting in his room all day becoming a sword fighter in a couple of weeks is as ridiculous as the dude being bullied and becoming a total psychopath. During the killing madness one former forensic scientist manages to find the time dissolving super glue and taking fingerprints of the ""murder""-victim (!) to prove the real perpetrator. How she was planning to take the prints of people running around hysterically I do not know. The only character that was interesting in this was the blonde calm and a little condescending dude. He had a lot of presence on screen and was acted very well. Well, maybe I wasn't the target audience. Good idea, less than mediocre execution unfortunately.",5
East Asia,"This is probably the best show Netflix has ever released.
The story-line is brilliant, the cast is amazing, special effects and OST are epic, and the acting is just insane.
This is one of those rare cases where the live action is way better than the manga... I binged the series about a month ago, and cannot seem to move on to my normal life. The obsession is real. Worth to watch and worth the hype for the upcoming season.Ps. Dori Sakurada and Tao Tsuchiya nailed their roles.",10
East Asia,"Can't stop watching!Just..one..more...episode.Sorry, your review is too short. Please try again.",10
East Asia,"When I heard that Netflix is going to turn a Japanese manga into a TV Series, I was pretty sure that it wouldn't work, because Netflix did this in the past (Death Note) and the result was awful. But this time, they left the Japanese to do the whole work and it totally worked out!In my opinion, Alice in Borderland is one of the best Series on Netflix. You want to see something that is going to freak you out and make you stuck with this show? Then Alice in Borderland is the best solution. The special effects are awesome and you can see the development of each character through the games that they play. Also the story line is really interesting!!! Love It!!!!",10
East Asia,Guys.. This was so disappointing and meaningless. The « actors » are so bad,1
East Asia,"I think this is the third time maybe when I write a review, but this tv show definitely earned my time and review.The story is amazing, is worth of Oscar and it t keps me on edge from the first episode till the last one.I don't want to give you details if what happens because I want you to enjoy it.",10
East Asia,"Episodes 1-4 terrific, Episodes 5-8 falls down. The probelm is the series changes after episode 4 where it was interesting to that point and then we end up in a beach community and it just goes pear shaped and makes little sense after that. The cards dont make sense either the numbers or the type. Whats the difference between a four of spades and a 8 of hearts? Sounds complex but when they are playing tag or hide and seek I cant relate to the cards anyway. Its nonsensical but still good for a part.",8
East Asia,"I get it that this is a great production, but the story and characters are just not that well crafted. Don't get me wrong, I'm very familiar with Japanese culture and the poker faces in most of the Japanese dramas and all, but despite the concept of the show was kind of interesting, this show is better enjoyed with your brain shut off.",5
East Asia,"So, for the first time in my life I watched and liked a Japanese show. Born out of boredom moretheless I watched it almost in a day.
The story of this coming of age/action packed/slasher series centers around Arisu. A young man who's done nothing noteble with his life sofar. Gaming is what he does. As on one good day the world as he knows it stops to make place for a surreal one which is almost empty. In order to stay alive he and his friends must participate in several death or alive games. As the story unfolds the viewers get not only to see a lot of action, but also interesting background about the key players.
Once you get over the language (here in Holland everything is subtiteld) you will find out that this is a very well written and acted series. It is fun to watch and you will be as curious for the next season as I am. Highly entertaining!",8
East Asia,"The pace, unpredictable nature and the intelligent manner in which the series is tailored always keeps you glued to the screen. Awaiting the new season that covers the remaining manga chapters",9
East Asia,"The idea behind it is quite interesting and offers a variety of paths to be explored, just like a video game, even though it's much more focused on puzzles and mind games, but...:The characters are too generic, just like an anime with horrible writing and no clear purpose. ^ (I've watched over 100 TV shows & anime and over 8000 movies) Which is why I can say that Chota is THE MOST MISERABLE character ever put on screen. Every time he appears it makes you cringe by what he says or does. It would've been more humane if he was killed of in it's first 10 min.Arisu is the generic good guy from every anime that has no qualities other than one. He mostly looks into the void and at the last moment comes with a solution, just to make him special over others that REALLY try to solve the puzzle. He is mostly surrounded by morons, just to make him look special.The only one who had a bit of potential was Karube, but he made Arisu look bad so... of course he was killed of.Honestly, from where the show is now, Chishiya is the most interesting of the bunch because of his lack of empathy, which is much more intriguing than ""I have a purpose"" anime cliche.All in all, below average show. Too many errors in character development, bad writing and no interest to follow any character, other than seeing what's the answer for the episode puzzle.",4
East Asia,"1st episode I'd give 7/10.
Cool idea, acting was quite ok and I was motivated to see more. Not many effects but everything was well made.2nd episode was a 6/10.
Quite ok and a good watch.3rd episode was a 5/10 and it already became boring and acting became worse. Also the game made no sense. My hopes that you could survive by being smart or anything (John Kramer, Jigsaw) got destroyed. In most games people must die without any reason.4-8 episodes were all 0/10.
Writing was a mess.
Acting was terrible. Really.
CGI was terrible.
Effects and physics were terrible.
And it made no sense and had nothing to do with the first episode.Overall a big disappointment and not worth watching. Trust me.Also the last 3 episodes were sooooo bad, I couldn't believe it. Nothing made sense.",1
East Asia,"This series is excellent. The storyline is unique and so well executed, the pacing is great and keeps you 100% interested at all times, and the characters are fantastic. The cinematography is so good and makes it even more enjoyable.The only thing that makes me dislike this series is the fact that I can never watch it for the first time again now! If you are a fan of the manga, then this show is one of very few live actions that absolutely does it's manga justice. If you have never read the manga or have any interest in doing so, then that doesn't matter at all. This series is very enjoyable whether you are a fan of manga or anime or not - and as long as you don't mind subtitles, I think any dystopian thriller/adventure lover will want to watch this one.",10
East Asia,Cool plot but the huge cringe moments constantly thrown at you are sometimes at the edge of throwing you off... Several times ive almost given this up but what kept me watching was the plot that kinda evens out the cringeness. So many clichees and strange dialogues... Can only give 5/10,5
East Asia,"Plot: at the beginning it takes a while before it starts running but it is really good! It has quite a good pace and it's intriguing.Actors and Actress & Acting: well, I guess that everyone is quite used to watch American stuff, so watching something with Asian actors and actress will be a little strange at the beginning, but at the end they wont disappoint you so much.Soundtrack: particular but for this kind of show I think it is good!Conclusions: At the beginning you'll have to have some patience before it starts running. Then it takes its pace.
There are just few moments that will makes you wrinkle your nose for some behaviours or just for some absurd things, but in general is a very well done show, above of some others that are more famous then this one.",9
East Asia,"Whole combination of maze runner, final destination, saw, among us, escape room aur hunger games. Loved the series. can't wait for season 2 to be out.",10
East Asia,"I liked the glimpses into normal Japanese life it gives, and somehow the regular scenes of empty Tokyo were also cool. However, the acting (please close your mouth Asugi?), and the complete lack of consistency later on (once at the 'Beach') just get annoying, ruining any sense of mystery.Such as -- why doesn't anyone use the resources of an abandoned city? Canned food, comfortable houses, generators. Or weapons, which might occasionally come in handy. There's one 'game' where they manage to beat someone with a gun -- but they don't take the gun after they beat them, which might simplify things for the next fight.They also seem to have painted themselves into too much of a corner with power of the gamemasters. Lasers from the sky, phones in the lobby, essentially god-like abilities with no apparent limits or explanation. At the start it's okay as part of the mystery, but later it becomes too much. (Did someone take that tiger out of a cage? Bring it to that place, and then carefully let it go, after goading it to be hungry enough to attack? And then come collect it later).And it tries to be gritty and real, but then mixes in people punching out tigers and bopping about in bikinis in an apocalypse. Nice to look at, but made no sense. If you don't feel there's actually an interesting solution to the mystery, you lose interest in resolving it.I would have liked a bit more of an exploration. How can you maintain any power structure when you need to go randomly fight for your life every few days? Can those laser punch into the earth? If I'm in the basement underneath you, do you just get killed too? Instead you just get a bunch of over-dramatized yelling at each other. I guess it's supposed to be anime/manga, but it didn't work for me.",3
East Asia,"This series is rather true to the original manga, but at the same time, the characters look realistic (sometimes when they try to stick with the original material, you get some ""colorful"" characters that are not very realistic).
I really hope they make a 2nd season (probably no 3rd though, seing how they wrapped up things in season 1, they won't have enough for a 3rd, except if they have some fillers (origin stories and parallel stories) like in the manga).
All in all, good acting, great scenery, great filming, CGI are decent.",9
East Asia,I am amazed by the series. The story is deep and contemporary at the same time.,8
East Asia,"Just finished watching and I loved it from the start to the finish. I thought the story, setting, acting and effects were all bang on. Anyone who's every watched battle royal will enjoy this. The brutality isn't as in your face and graphic as battle royal, but Its still not lacking in that department. Every episode ends with more questions then answer (in a lost kinda way) but it will keep you watching. I highly recommend. I'm looking forward to season 2.",10
East Asia,"First few episodes are amazing and really gripping but as soon as they get to the beach house everyone seems to loose logical thought and forget they have to compete in these death game's!
Characters make illogical jumps and assumptions constantly, and deliberately withholds information from the audience to create the twists.
Perhaps my biggest gripe is the completely inappropriate way everyone dresses for games they know might be physical and need to run in!If you really love dystopias you'll probably still enjoy it but it gets very silly",6
East Asia,Its so bad that it becomes enjoyable. Pure cringe and nonsense but I wouldn't mind a second season.,1
East Asia,"Amazing,
Japanese are so damn creative! This show is underrated",10
East Asia,"Battle Royale was a movie that I enjoyed tremendously. It's one of those movies that I can watch over and over again. Alice in Borderland shared similarities and it kept me glued to my TV.I watched Alice in Borderland on a whim because I like shows that incorporates games as a means to survival. The games are deadly and messed up and I was here for that. Granted 8 episodes are short to introduce a whole bunch of characters but at the same time but I thought the production team did well to weave in the main storylines of the root characters. You get to understand who they were and how the hell did they end up trapped in this game.I did not read the Webtoon so I went into Alice in Borderland as a brand new consumer and from my pov, Season 1 did not disappoint!The set up of the games are simple, rules and objective are clear: Survive or die. The introduction the 52 decks of cards, setting them as levels of the types of games you will play is interesting. The show also did not disappoint in the gore.I don't want to get into the details and ruined the experience of a first time watcher. I went headfirst into the show and left with wanting more. 8 episodes was too short and I needed more!I am extremely looking forward for season 2 and the next set of games!",8
East Asia,"Go and watch it,I'm 100% percent sure that you'll like it",10
East Asia,"As the title suggests, I did not like this series at first... but then I am not a of Japanese anime or some of the other odd things they do (their game shows spring to mind)....However, this series just got better and better and I would encourage anyone who is curious by the series to stick with it, as it has more going on in each episode than initially meets the eye. For example, in each episode there is a clue early on that gives the answer towards the end... what that clue is, I never noticed until they pointed it out... but I thoroughly enjoyed learning what it was.So the good and the bad:It gets off to a rocky start. Unless you are a Japanese film, or anime, fan you might be inclined to turn it off early on.The acting from the main characters is good.However, the acting from the extras is lousy.The wardrobe department need a rap on the knuckles here (with the extras), everything is too contrived and too 'clean'The series had me hooked soon after the first episode and it only improved from there. I am looking forward to the second season.",9
East Asia,The show and the idea behind it is very good but also is very confusing. because many things do not make sense yet. I hope in season 2 we figure out about the games and its creature,6
East Asia,"First Japanese show I've watched. Started off a bit ropey but hang in there and you are rewarded immensely .
Violent and quite brutal at times. Looking forward to season 2.",10
East Asia,"During the show you'll be spending a hell of a lot of time wondering whether the cringey and, at times, simply flawed acting, the illogical twists and weird details (nearly every girl being semi-nude during the entire show) are part of some kind of new artstyle or whether they're just part of a not-so-great Japanese Netflix Original. Well, for me, it is the clear that the latter is the case here.",3
East Asia,"This series is truly a hidden gem. I am pretty sure that once you start watching, you just don't want to stop. Only one episode in but hooked. It is based on manga which is a retelling of ""Alice in Wonderland"" story and it is an ACTION-ADVENTURE-MYSTERY-TRAGEDY-THRILLER about chosen groups of people had moved to the game world, and they forced to conquer all the games that's about death and life. On the same page, they need to participate and conquer the games in order to survive in limited factors such as time, cards, etc. For the beginning, the show starts interesting and it made me not think about thriller. Anyway, after a few minites it reminded me it was still thriller lol. Furthermore, I was ridiculous and curious a bit when they moved to the alternate world that had the stuff same as the actual world but there're only chosen people had lived in this world, so they can stay in luxurious places with Michelin food without paying. By the way, I really have to say that the storytelling, characterization, hooked point, and so on are all fascinating. Moreover, it can surprise me every episodes. Even though, sometimes I feel unbelievable with the characters' decisions and games' rules. But I love it when I tried to solve the problems with Arisu. It's literally fun!!! Like as the puzzle. Furthermore, the actors and actresses are great and they acted their character very clear and interesting. Plot is not complicated much but I really got hooked up with the scenes that Arisu and his friends joined the game, and I can't be waiting for watching what will be happened next. However, I recommend this series because I confirm it will give you a unique experience that you have never feel it with the others before.",10
East Asia,"What can I say .A ok series.plot was good but they didn't justify to make it pure class .
Many things happens so quickly and the 1st stage was like last stage .with very short time .so many things happening .in middle it's lost that twist and last episode was just . disappointment .but better then nothing to watch.",4
East Asia,"My favourite series is Alice in borderland because I think that this is the best series.
I love this series because there action, dangerous and even deadly games with sometimes only one survivor.
I like the actors, I find that they play their roles very well.
For my part my favorite actor is Nijiro Murakami in the role of chishiya.
This series is thrilling whit a lot of adrenaline.
If I had to rate Alice in borderland, this one would be 10/10.
For those who love action and who are not afraid of blood, I strongly recommend this series.",10
East Asia,"I really enjoyed watching Alice in Borderland. The characters are engaging and the story is interesting. Also, the fact that two the main characters die makes the show even more gripping since this kind of thing rarely happens !! and it's almost impossible not to cry at episode three..I really recommend this series if you like anything that revolves around dangerous games. ;)",10
East Asia,One of those odd ones that takes a while. By the time you get to e07 of S01 you may find yourself hooked.,8
East Asia,"This series is amazing. Unless you're a sociopath, it will have you feeling every emotion on the spectrum. Happy, sadness, anger, anxious and it will even cause adrenaline spikes. I certainly recommend this series to both friends and family. You can either watch it with English dubbed voice overs or its original Japanese language with English subtitles. Definitely try it out! Great story and great character development.",10
East Asia,"The theme is okay but there have been way better movies using it ( see as the god's will ) . The plot holes are constant and in one extent that the series are a whole mess . The death games are boring , the characters shallow and stiff and the cinematography plain . There are 0 likeable characters I swear , their back stories make no sense + the series drastically changes in the 3 episode and it's still bad . Aw and the worst thing is definitely the pace ITS SO SLOW nothing literally happens for like the whole episode . This could be like 5 minutes episodes , still trash but not such a big waste of time",1
East Asia,"I honestly watched this and it was instantly my kind of thing. Play the game or die, win the game or die.The concept of the cards representing the difficulty of each game was actually a nice touch too. The cliche 1 second before the game kills you actually put me on the edge of my seat so many times and it made me want to watch more. I don't really watch series because they drag on but this definitely got me hooked.I really recommend this. If you like twisted reality, parallel universe, play sadistic games or you die then this is your kind of series.",9
East Asia,Watch the cards this ain't for the money But your life depends on it. Sweet concept I would probably fold. Stay alive crazy concept and it's really good. New fan. . Love it.,8
East Asia,"Starting to the end of the series, the character build up and friendship between all three of them are good .A top notch performance by Alice in acting individually. Building up the characterisation and leading to a terrific ending which kept a suspense through out the ending of the seasonBig Hope for 2nd seasonThank you.",8
East Asia,I have never watched a Japanese series before and I am not used to watch anything else than English or Swedish movies and shows but I loved this one!I would really recommend it! Can't wait for season 2.,10
East Asia,"Review of Season One:ALICE IN BORDERLAND is a Japanese Netflix TV show based on a popular manga (as are so many). I'm just done watching the eight episodes of season one and I'm blown away by the quality of the series. It's very much like an updated BATTLE ROYALE, with a sudden apocalypse followed by incessant life-or-death games that our protagonists have to play through to earn playing cards. Imagine THE CRYSTAL MAZE but with killer lasers and arterial spray instead of Richard O'Brien waffling on about mumsey and you've got it. Excellent quality throughout and a great mix of plot, character, FX and action. What impressed me most is the consistency of this one, usually a show has some weaker episodes but I rated all of them 7/10 or above, so it gets a 9/10 overall from me. It really is that good and I'm eager for season two.Review of Season Two:Oh dear. Season 2 is a big let down and drop in quality from the first one. There are eight episodes and at least half are filler. Some of the action involving a guy marauding with armour is fun but hardly a 'game'. There are a couple of really good games here but most are rushed through too quickly. The last episode, which explains the whole plot from the beginning, is appalling. Average at best, this one.",7
East Asia,"I am amazed at how many people give a 10/10 grade after watching just 1-2 episodes (please don't do that) or a 1 or 2/10 complaining about cringeworthy acting and bad dialogues when they've watched subbed versions (noone's expected to understand japanese, but can you not read subtitles??)
In truth, at least for someone who hasn't read the manga, it is an interesting show with an exciting premise that falls kind if flat after our leads get to that beach. It does have a few characters that scream ""manga"" like the annoying Cheshire cat guy or, worse, the tattooed freak, but even with those the show remains entertaining and watchable to the end, even if it loses its grip plot-wise. Season 2 will be a challenge for the scriptwriters, but personally I will give it a go.",7
East Asia,"Great adaptation of the manga.Great cast, exactly what you would expect from a manga adaptation.",10
East Asia,"All I can said is that this series really know how to keep me to watching al of the episode, because this series really have a brilliant opening and ending. It's really exciting from the first to second episode but feels boring in the middle, but when you reach the three episode before the ending, it's getting moreeee complicated and all you can do just watch it till the end. Because trust me, the ending was amazing haha.",8
East Asia,They have changed a lot of scenes that shouldn't have been changed from the manga and the acting is a meh for me like I prefer the secondary characters acting better than the main lead one.,5
East Asia,"I haven't read the manga, but it feels like a much more appropriate means for this story, being live action the entire series comes off as silly, the characters are not believable as human beings at all and every single episode you´ll have a mental breakdown wondering why they consistently act in the most autistic way possible. DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THE HIGH RATINGS, as I was, this show isn't that bad if you´ve had a lobotomy beforehand. The first episode shows soo much potencial but in every following one the quality drops. Soo many avenues go unexplored, soo many nonsensical decisions, its a good apocalypse scenario but the every one in it dropped 100 IQ points as soon as it started. I may be a little too harsh in this review, if you´re not one to overanalyze the decisions of every character chances are you´ll enjoy this show, but if, like myself, you cant stand people acting like they might forget how to breath at any minute then give this one a pass.",4
East Asia,"This is without a doubt one of the worst things to ever be created. Don't even bother watching it because you will become less of a person for it. It is simple indoctrination material to become an immoral, disgusting, pig. Please don't give this crap a good review unless you are a disgustingly evil person. If you like this show you will probably go to HELL!",1
East Asia,"I will admit that I am not familiar with the source manga though obviously I am with the Alice in Wonderland. That said, this is great ride, likeable characters, great effects and an all round solid performance.As an aside, I do often wonder about a slight anti Asian bias creeping in on some of the reviews particularly when it comes to acting where it is always characterised as ""wooden/stilted"" or ""over-acting"" different cultures have different aesthetics and cultural norms when it comes to social responsibility and the like, I get the feeling people don't appreciate that...Anyway, if you like a cracking story with overtones of ""Battle Royale"" and ""cyberpunk"" then you will love this, I for one am looking forward to seeing the game masters and the queen of hearts.",8
East Asia,"Super kinetic series that loses it's way towards the end but brings you back in with a nice finale leaving you wanting season 2 now! If you love manga & Japanese action thrillers like Battle Royale & Tokyo Gore Police, you'll like AIB. I've not read the AIB manga but this makes me want to.It's like Cube meets The Running Man. Highly recommend.",8
East Asia,"A grisly production. The effects, particularly when town scenes look like models sitting on an animator's desk, are often subpar. Rather than try, again and again, to create wide views of districts in Tokyo, sans the populace, the creators might have done more through the subtlety of suggestive framing, thereby prompting the audience to contribute more through their own imagination. With a different approach to visuals and editing, this could have been an atmospheric, haunting viewing experience. Instead, the clank and din of the show's overly literal graphics served up grotesqueries, but little beauty. A production with a much smaller budget could have made use of a warehouse for a few days and served up less of an emetic.",6
East Asia,"I think it is the best Netflix series, I have seen...",10
East Asia,"I was so shocked to see another review on here stating that the show got progressively worse as it went on ""like most other Japanese TV shows"", and I'll agree that this is quite often the case with series of this type, but honestly in this case I could not disagree more.This show is an absolute masterclass in modern Japanese storytelling and it's maintained right through to the final episode. I watched it in the original Japanese with English subtitles but paid close attention to the references to characters from the famous Alice in Wonderland stories.There is unfortunately some cases of poorrepresentation of female characters, in that many are fully able, combat-trained survival types that are somehow suddenly and inexplicably incapable of fighting off weak, petite boys trying to subdue them... but other elements of the show give hope that representation and inclusion in Japanese films may be changing for the better.That aside, every episode is a thrill ride of its own, full of hidden messages and unique shots of a deserted, lifeless Tokyo that's practically impossible to imagine. I am desperately awaiting a second season and will welcome it with open arms.",9
East Asia,"All the episodes are very good exept 5th one !Graphics are lit
Fast screenplay!",8
East Asia,"This is like ""Maze Runner"". I am kind of disappointed as I had high hopes about this. It felt like watching getting killed in different ways. Okay,the male lead is okay with his awesome skills but no one can solve the puzzle except him. Why? Are these are too dumb? And the ending was really the worst thing that could happen. The leader kills everyone just because they influence his friend(the previous leader)!! Isn't it really funny? He killed his friend that doesn't matter at all but his friend was influenced and that got him killed in his own hands matters??.",5
East Asia,"I felt this was a series of almost two halves. It started really well and it was visually interesting, good story, involved characters. But as the series progressed it got less interesting. The last episode in particular I thought was full of time fillers and pretty boring. It could have done with being a six episode series and that would have smartened the editing, which may have helped retain the tension that was there at the start and non existent by the end. Worth watching, just be prepared for it to fizzle out. Th7/10.",7
East Asia,"I liked alice in borderland a lot, and a season 2 does sound interesting, not sure if its already out or? Im definitely interested in the manga/anime. But the plot was good, my favorite character would be chisiya by far. I cried a bit watching the episode where his friends were blown up, but overall it was great. Im sure the acting couldve been better...",8
East Asia,"Interesting concept. Extremely poor execution. You don't care about the characters (they're all annoying stereotypes), the acting is terrible, the English dubbing is terrible, the dialogue (English subtitles) is stilted, people don't act like actual human beings, and everything takes so long to happen. There's dozens of scenes just waiting, lingering on something we already know is going to happen - just get on with it!As the title of my review says, it's a great way to get bored to sleep then startled awake by random loud noises.",4
East Asia,"Painful expressions interpret all emotions. I cannot understand actor's try to express, and he is crash anytime.",5
East Asia,"I wish it wasn't based off a comic book. The main character gives off the vibe of an anime protagonist and it gets annoying at times. The episodes with the games are really thrilling and good but outside of the games it's just an okay story. It's goring and violent with a lot of twists, it's just the characters I don't really like. If you love anime you'd probably enjoy this show a lot more.",7
East Asia,"It's filled with many ""bad"" little things that just ruin the whole show. The acting can be very very cringe sometimes. The whole series just feeling like a teenage show and not something for grown-ups.At the same time, there is some potential in the story, there is some very good suspens, but that's about it. SO i would not say this is a horrible show, but at the same time, I wouldn't say this is a good or solid show.If you have really nothing on your watch-list, and you pretty much saw the major highly-rated tv shows, then watch this while waiting for another good show or another season of your favorite show.",7
East Asia,"The serie consists of lots of twist, which help maintain your interest!",10
East Asia,My brain got rapped watching the next half of the show.,6
East Asia,It has been a very long time since there has been something on this level. Very very impressive. When is season 2?!?!,10
East Asia,"Let me start off by saying that the story indeed does have some plot holes, and there are definitely parts where you need to let some poorly worked out details slide to keep yourself hooked, but other than that I found it quite enjoyable.Sure, its a pity that such a good premise wasn't worked out to the fullest since the premise had so much potential in itself, but I do feel people are being to harsh on it. If you take the story for what it is (fantasy) than anything is possible, including the more unbelievable decisions made in the plot.",7
East Asia,Arisu is a young man who is the youngest heir in a well known family. He is careless and lives his life the way he want to. He has two friends Chota and Karube who are his only friends. One day they find themselves inside a game where they have to complete tasks assigned by an anonymous person. The difficulty of the game is shown by cards.It is an interesting series which gets you hooked on to it from the first episode itself. It only has eight episode s so we can watch it in go.,8
East Asia,"This show is one of the greatest shows of this decade! So well-produced & put together! I loved every episode, every question, every answer!",10
East Asia,I liked it so I had to leave a review and hope for more seasons . Very nice adaptation of the manga . Good actors and suspenseful atmosphere.,9
East Asia,"A well crafted movie with, amazing set designs and plot just gets intriguing.Actors have done absolutely well, this is a show where suspense never dies and surprise never stops coming.",8
East Asia,"The show's premise was actually good, if they had stuck with the same formula this could have been a lot better. Unfortunately, everything hit rock bottom with the inclusion of the bikini utopia. The plot became more ludicrous as we progressed through the beach arc. The show just randomly throws around flashbacks. There are these really sickening characters, the show wants you to sympathise with by showing their repressed past.Also stop making live action an exact copy of the manga or anime, there are some elements, that only work in anime. Including that in a live action only comes off as cheesy and cheap. This live action ticks all the boxes of the anime trope. What could have been a great survival show, ends up in the landfill of live action dumpster fire.",5
East Asia,The plot is amazing and every single episode is worth to watch. Some people say it got bad after the third episode but i definitely don t see it this way. The actors did their job well. I havent read the manga yet but i can t wait for season 2!!,10
East Asia,It's a great survival game series. The concept is really impressive. The story line too. And the characters development and acting are so flawless.But I got dissapointed the fight sences of the sword guy and the girl(in real he's a guy). Anyway waiting for the season 2. I recommened it.,8
East Asia,The fireworks few episodes is good to watch. It was so excited. But when it comes to the beach scene i was like whoaa what the hell is this? It got me bored and stop watching. What a waste.,4
East Asia,"It's a good show i love the plot, it really made me fluttor cuz how sad that they being stucked there. But for the plot i guess it is too fast so i don't really enjoy the game.",8
East Asia,I enjoyed it till the end. About how the story rolls towards the ending that reminds me of Black Mirror.,10
East Asia,"Fast pace, unusual events, great setting and camerawork... Minus point is 'beach', it was a bit too long and unnessecary. Waiting for S2!",10
East Asia,I still have no clue where's the hype coming from. Characters development is soooo bad and I dont even feel emotionally connected with any of the characters. The show gets really cringey after the third episode. I forced myself to watch it till the last episode because I was hoping everything would finally make sense at the end but nope.,3
East Asia,"This would be a 10 if it wasn't for the main character's personality. I mean, it's like a depressive emo complaining and whining about life instead of trying to figure out what's going on and how to survive. I would prefer to see a different development where the character deals with what's going on with a strong mentality. Instead we have this whining little b****, and even though it's realistic, it's not interesting to see as a main character.For me this didn't work and it was the only problem with the series. Other than that it's awesome.",8
East Asia,"The writing's not the best, the acting's not the best, there are plot holes, people get lucky for plot convenience or because it looks cool, and the exposition's not the best, leading to moments that are supposed to be emotionally deep but fail.It's also got your usual mix of cliché anime characters; the smart one, the cool one, the wimpy one, the tough one, the bad guy's weird and creepy henchmen, etc.But, the concept is interesting and so are the games, and the sets are well designed too. So it does keep things entertaining enough to sit through it. Although, it's a good thing it was only 8 episodes, because even that started to drag a bit.Since there are enough good and bad elements, it lands at a solid 5/10.",4
East Asia,This show was so fun to watch! I especially loved the courage Arisu has despite the amount of heartbreak and physical pain he's been through.,8
East Asia,The games that they played are challenging. It is not meant for the faint-hearted / dim-witted...,8
East Asia,"A unique and very enjoyable look at how humanity reacts to forced violence. I enjoyed the characters and the twists and turns. I also enjoyed having a flashback to each character's past, it had me feeling sympathy for even the worst villains, well, except creepy tongue jerk. His explaining of rape whilst licking his victim made my stomach churn, but then that's just good acting!",8
East Asia,"Got hooked to the series after the first few episodes. The plots, the thrill in most of action scenes give chill down the spine. I love how unpredictable it is compared to other survival series. Highly recommend!",10
East Asia,So bad. This could have been so good one. So many unlogical mistakes.,5
East Asia,"Over-the-top acting, extremely stereotypical characters, no emotional connection to any of the characters, predictable characters as how you can tell which ones will live and which ones will survive, and an incredible amount of frustratingly illogical decision making by all characters throughout the show. If you are under the age of 14 or only watch anime, this show is for you. If you are over 14 or have never watched anime before, do not waste your time with this show; you will be extremely disappointed.",2
East Asia,"I have started this after the hype started around Squid game. It was on my watching list for a longer time, but i never came to watch it.The beginning of the series caught my attention. It has a great and interesting story line, which wants you to know more about the story. In my personal experience, I had a hard time getting attached to the characters or understand them. At some stages in the series, the development of the characters were too fast. On the other hand, some scenes and episodes were extremely slow. I think if there would have been a balance here, the series would have come off better.Overall I think it is a great series. The games in which they participate are interesting enough, but may also seem obvious while the characters obviously play dumb. I'm curious about the second season, since some questions are still unanswered. I'd recommend you to watch this if you are in for a mystery! If you are doubting to watch because of the gore, in my opinion it wasn't that bad. There are no jumpscares and you will know when something is gonna happen!",8
East Asia,"I warched through the whole series and it's a masterpiece, there's a character development , you are pretty much unable to tell what will happen next thought after it's happened it's still make sense, unlike the boring Hollywood movies where you can tell what will happen from the first 2 minutes .All of the people's who's complain about the beach part pretty much don't understand it how the game's working, belive me if you use your brain for a bit everything will make sense .SPOILERGathering is a human thing , ofcourse the elderly people's will mostly die quickly in this world since most of the game require either sacrifice or strength. Also the beach was never a charity people's gathering there to survive and not to help.And the main reason for the beach is the 10 of heart
Heart means playing with people "" heart"" 10 is the difficulty and agame with this difficulty only can happen in a large group .",10
East Asia,"This show started out great. There was a real sense of suspense and mystery. The images of an empty Tokyo, and especially the Shibuya scramble, looks outstanding. Save for some green screen fuzz in their hair, the environment looks absolutely real. The story in the first half is engaging and the acting quite good, with very little of the Japanese style overacting which is far too common.And then we get to the beach where the show falls flat right on its face. The show loses momentum and its mysterious appeal. The isolation in the first part of this show really worked in its favor, but once they get to the beach seemingly half of Tokyo has shown up there to party. The beach is riddled with bad actors, especially the guy with the assault rifle and the guy with face tattoos and a katana. Everything they do is so over the top. They have drama school rejects written all over them.Perhaps this is a very faithful adaptation of the manga. Supposedly the manga was inspired by Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland, but I don't see how except in the most superficial sense in the form of a couple of the characters' names. If there is a second season I'll probably watch it, but if I said I'm dying to see it, that would be a lie.Edit: Well, season 2 was also stretched pretty thinly. It felt like we spent almost an eternity at the container park and the prison. But the ending was very beautiful, which was enough for me to raise my score by one star. I've read about the comic on which this show is based, and it seems like the characters, the antagonists in particular, are more fleshed out. Because I felt like they lacked motivation, especially considering the ending.",6
East Asia,"Chaos, madness, blood, tears... Not for lighthearted.",10
East Asia,I absolutely love this series and can't wait until season two. Haven't read the manga. Can't wait to find out more of what happened to get rid of basically all the people and why some are left but they have different timelines. And where do the lasers come from? And is everyone who disappeared gone or are they still somewhere? Aaand when will they find the dressed cards?,10
East Asia,"I watched the series last year and very soon became one of my top favourites. I recommended to people who like action, clever thinking and thrillUnlike the squid game that everybody hype this is WAY MUCH BETTER
It's more complicated it's more fan it's more clever
Must watch.",10
East Asia,"Best series in this type of genre, fast pace and accurate. Much better than squid game.",10
East Asia,"Lots of bugs and loses momentum from about episode 3 and completes loses it when they get to the beach, nevertheless first 2 episodes despite the bugs are quite enjoyable and original.",7
East Asia,"Came off here after watching squid game. I enjoyed the first few eps, and then the show just went off the rails.",5
East Asia,"No wonder this show was a flop and no one knew it existed until Squid Game became a global hit. I cannot believe anyone recommending this after watching Squid Game. This show was a disaster with terrible acting and meaningless characters that evoke no emotion whatsoever and so many loopholes. Plot fails, reminds of Black Mirror at the end.",1
East Asia,"The first 4 episodes are really good. For the last 4 episodes though, I had them on in the background while I was doing something else. Drawn out and a lot of talking. I thought it would be like watching squid game but no. I feel like you can't compare the two shows, they're different from each other. A few inconsistencies in the series but other than that I was thinking about it when I wasn't watching it.(wouldn't everyone be playing their first game together? How come some people had already played like 5 games even though the world had just shut off at the exact same time for every single person??)",5
East Asia,"Great stuff. I went into this with few expectations. The first episode looked good and it just kept on getting better.Beautifully shot, well acted (use the Japanese audio and English subtitles)... it keeps you guessing. The only criticism I can actually think of is occasionally overdoing the extreme emotional close up (esp the end of the first hearts game)... but this is minor and probably personal taste.This is a great series and it seems it's been renewed too. Nice.",9
East Asia,"It could have been done much more interestingly ... It looks interesting like this, but nothing special.",7
East Asia,"Wonderful series, exciting and full of well-characterized characters that are easy to get attached to, a really good series. Engaging from start to finish, the tension level never drops and always remains at very high levels.",10
East Asia,"Maybe it's just me that I find manga and any related series/movies exciting due to the language (any asiatic language) which I find interesting to listen (coming from a Balkan- Mediterranean background I'm a little bit jealous of their accents), but this series was actually on point. Liked the story behind it (parallel universe) and the way the characters expanded throughout the episodes. Kinda was sad in the middle (won't spoil tho) but it's a definitely a hit for anyone that likes fantasy/splatter/agony content. It's an 9 cause I'lol wait for the next season to have a complete opinion.",9
East Asia,"Well, it was decent. Liked the bond between usagi and arisu but there were a lot if very strange characters that were out of place. Over all an ok production. Probably will watch season 2.",6
East Asia,Far too much drama and I'd say bad acting as well.I think you can enjoy if you have no brain at all otherwise is kind of waste of time.,3
East Asia,"I liked the story, the acting not that much. But would watch a season 2 though.",8
East Asia,"I've never read the manga, so I don't know how well is it adapted. The first couple of episodes were meh, but starting from episode 3, the show started to pick up. Of course the action scenes and some of the characters are over the top, however, that didn't stop me from enjoying the show for what it is. Give it a try, you might either like or hate the show after episode 3 and the beach arc. If you're too critical about plot holes and ex Machina moments, you might probably not like the show. I personally enjoyed it thoroughly. Can't wait for the season 2.",8
East Asia,"I saw this before Squid Game was released and at the time it was pretty original. The first couple episodes were the better of the series, definitely lagging in the middle when the introduced the Beach. Great finale though. Really great production value as well.",8
East Asia,The show was disappointing for me ! The performance of the actors was weak for most of them ! It's been long time since I watched something that I couldn't wait for it to finish !That was my first Japanese show to watch I was so disappointed cuz I'm used to watch anime and I thought yeah that could live up to the amazing anime I have watched over the years but unfortunately that was not the case at all !,4
East Asia,So after what one thinks might be a cool show with awesome plots and great reveals you find out nothing of value by the end of the series. There's no logic or why? Characters seem extremely mundane and really not that interesting! Feels like who ever wrote this was or is still in their teenage years. Where's the plot?? So bunch of young kinds just roam around Tokyo where everyone has disappeared to play in some game with no real reason or reward.I'm angry there was no plot. What's my reason of believing these characters are worth investing in? And the random throwbacks! If I want to even get more angry watch it dubbed!Overall not that good.,4
East Asia,"The idea is good, but the story line is so weak and with bad acting typical Japanese overreacting it's meh. It got worse and worse after 5th episode. You can watch it if you can't find anything to watch..",6
East Asia,"The first couple of episodes are decent enough, group of young lads, not sure about their futures, living on the edge of society, get thrown into this alternate reality where everyone else has disappeared.The sum of the 3 characters adds up to something interesting.Then it all goes downhill fast and we're all of a sudden left with a male and female protagonist who are wooden, dull and wildly uninteresting.The male lead's primary character trait is 'spacing out'. For one episode he struggles for an hour gaffa taped to a chair. Fascinating.Other stuff happens. You don't care. There's a silver haired character who looks smugly on during every scene. Not at all annoying.Then you get a random video pointing you towards the next part of the story.Its bad and I felt depressed after watching it.",4
East Asia,"That's why Westerns can't adapt manga/anime , this show gets it it's very cheesy like an anime with alot of charcter depth , only thing i hated was the van episode.",10
East Asia,"The four stars I've given this reflects the number of episodes that are watchable. It begins quite reasonably. We're invested in the characters, tensions are built and the mystery surrounding the game is the main drawing point of the entire show. But as the series progresses it gets increasingly dumb. The writing is plain lazy. It treats the audience as if we're stupid. The writer's are having to bend over backwards in order to 'connect the dots' re the plot..and it just doesn't work. It's just lazy writing. And basic. The 'revelations' are just basic, no other word for it. A cigar smoking chimp on a type writer spits out better scripts than this. I literally laughed out loud at each plot point that gets revealed in the final few episodes.Once the reveals are made you obviously look back at the actions of the characters in the prior episodes, piecing together the puzzle of how we arrived at the point we have...and none of it is plausible. Well... plausible isn't the right word. It's just.. here's that word again..basic. I was so disappointed with this show. Three or four reasonable episodes doesn't constitute a series worth watching. Just watch ""Squid Game"" if you wanna see how a series is written an executed properly. This was a waste of time in the end.",4
East Asia,I will survive. An idle computer game fanatic suddenly finds himself with his friends in a deserted Tokyo where they must compete in dangerous games on a regular basis or die. It is a dystopian world where the game masters have no regard for life and push people into seeing how far they will sink to live. Well acted series with plenty of twists and turns and in a genre that the Japanese cinema excel in.,8
East Asia,I give it a 3/10The series feels like a live action anime. Some of the characters even seem like the usual anime tropes you'd find. Maybe if I hadn't seen Squid Game when it debuted I might have enjoyed this more but nothing beats the dark grittiness of Korean cinema...especially when it's executed so well.This show is much more in tune with the Japanese anime style of mixing action with drama back to back and throwing in over the top characters and ideas to keep things interesting. The show is probably more engaging for a younger audience than for others looking to get more substance.For me I found it a hard watch because the characters are very generic and the plot revolving around them playing games for days to avoid execution is less exciting than you would think for it to be. You find yourself not caring much for any of the characters at all because they're unrelatable. So far I've made it quite a bit into the series but I found myself losing more and more interests every episode. It's hard to be concerned about characters you don't care about in a series that requires you to care if the main characters live or die in order to enjoy it.,3
East Asia,"Starts well but after the episode 5 gets really messy... So many plot holes, it's kinda confusing but it's fun to watch.",6
East Asia,"Great beginning with interesting drama. Suspense is higher than I expected, and creativity is on the table. The downsides are that some episodes are much better than others and special effects are bad.",8
East Asia,I loved the games and how the plot was developed. It's quite awesome.,10
East Asia,"Big sci-fi fan, but this felt like it was written by a 15 year old school boy. One dimensional characters with overtly misogynistic tendencies. Give it a miss.",1
East Asia,"Does it require suspension of disbelief? Any plot holes? YES. Take it easy bros! It's a fun show to watch with very decent production values. Oh & being a guy, i cant complain
...lots of pretty japanese ladies here.So if your brain too tired from a crazy week at work, chill out & binge this over a weekend.",8
East Asia,"Started off as a 6, then quickly sinks to 0.Teenage flick. Melodrama, cringing overacting, lousy scripting, uninteresting characters. I was still curious to see where this would take us but the acting and script bothered me so much I forwarded often. The story is similar to Squid Game, which I thought WAY better in comparison. Also, there was a lot of stuff I didn't think remotely credible. I don't mind absurdistic storylines if well executed but can't stand characters making ridiculously stupid choices. I've decided not to list them as to not have spoilers, but there were many.One minor ***spoiler alert *** though: the ""beach"" scenes seemed ridiculous to me, suddenly all sunhine, party and swarming with people (whereas until then the world was dark and the people very spare), with as the leading bad guy another cringingly overacted completely uninteresting character. Little puts me off like empty-headed antagonists. Then he dies and the next absurd psychos step in. That was the main problem with this series for me (next to a thin storyline and unimpressive acting): I didn't give a rat's ### about the characters.",1
East Asia,"I was hooked with this then they got to the beach and the witchhunt began, after that it's was pointless back stories for characters that died anyway. It started to drag out over the last few episodes at this point too.And the acting started to become worse with each actor.",4
East Asia,"A little bit childish with over the top bad acting, and a wafer-thin plot.Seems like an anime turned into motion picture without any attempt to make the characters or setting more realistic. It might have worked in the anime format but in this form, it just comes across as unnecessarily dramatic, corny and a bit annoying. Won't be keeping my eyes peeled for Season 2, but perhaps I'm not the target audience.",6
East Asia,"Man, you see the Netflix logo and you expect the same predictable garbage you see in every other Netflix show but wow, this ain't it. It's quite special.Clearly not as high-budget as Squid Games, it's obvious it's mostly filmed on a green screen, but the characters - the gang - I loved it almost from the beginning. Too bad everything I loved is gone in episode three. I haven't watched the rest but I'm already sad that the chemistry I got invested in was offed so quickly.My only real gripe is that some scenes are very slow sometimes, as if trying to grasp for that 1-hour mark. And since Japanese culture is so different, a lot of moments and meanings are lost in translation and don't make much sense.In any case, that doesn't ruin the show, it is super enjoyable to binge watch.And unlike Squid Games, the English voice acting is actually quite good. Kinda like watching Final Fantasy dubbed.Definitely watch this. Avoid everything else Netflix is peddling to you and watch it.Values like friendship, honor, sacrifice, support even from strangers, you'll never see that in American Netflix-made garbage. That's why you need to watch this. To restore your faith in humanity at least a little bit.",1
East Asia,After watching Squid Games it was recommended I watched Alice in Borderland. I'll be honest I'd never heard of it beforehand. Unlike Squid Games it gets going from the word go and for the first 4 episodes I was hooked. Unfortunately after that it all goes in a different direction and not in a good way. Like I said in the title i so much wanted more from it and sadly it failed to deliver.,5
East Asia,"It's a waste of time, no explanation for anything, nothing makes sense, it's just wast of time.",2
East Asia,"First episodes are good and exciting.How ever in the last ones it became way too much ""Japanese stereotyped"". At some point the story went from a good thriller to a sort of manga live action. Almost like watching another different program.Entertaining...however, is not for everyone.",5
East Asia,"I won't say too much. Good plot. Lots of potential. Bad cringe acting. Not so good making. Boring in the 2nd half.I think after Squid Game Japanese fans were too eager to promote it & over sold it. The ""underrated"" kink made it stupidly overrated. & I'm not being bitter while talking about the corny acting fr I had to visibly cringe at some of the emotional deliveries. Over the top at everything.",4
East Asia,"This truly does feel like live action anime. I found myself physically cringing at times, the acting is so over the top it's ridiculous. You can find all the anime clichés in this. The robot-like cool person, the insane bald bad guy with tattoos, cringy super emotional good guy greg protagonist...Another user said it feels like whoever made this has no concept of natural human interactions and this was the exact same thing that kept coming to my mind while I was watching the series.The plot is okay (although senseless) but some of the games (or solutions) make no sense whatsoever.There are a lot of androgynous looking actors, if you're into that it might make certain episodes a semi-enjoyable watch for you.",5
East Asia,"Below average acting, directing, cinematography, scripting, music, pacing.Premise is ok, execution is bad. Very slow and has little to redeem itself. I had low expectations for something from Japan, and was still disappointed.",5
East Asia,"The nonsense starts at THE Beach. Plus, more violence against women. Strange and unnecessary to have focus on that.Why do the killers have backstories, but not the decent characters? And such random timing with them.And who would trust teen girls to be in charge of games where people die? That was second dumbest plot point.The dumbest was THE WITCH HUNT game, where a bunch of people get murdered cause the leader said so. Said leader killed his friend, who was also a psycho. And killing his friend made him want everyone else to die and kill others.I had a problem with the shooting deaths, because they seem to stylize the shooters or make their killings seem so easy to do. Japan hasn't suffered mass shootings like the US, so they don't really seem to get the message they're sending. Nobody needs a backstory on the guy shooting a bunch of people. What? Am I supposed to have sympathy for him? He just shot like 30 people.Too much shooting death. Soured the mood of the show and made it not entertaining. I don't wanna see real life on screen in this kind of show.",4
East Asia,I truly believe that this is a good show but I feel like you need to go in knowing that it's based of a manga which is why it seems like one some times with the extreme overacting and unbelievably fight scenes.Even then I do believe that this show is enjoyable to watch and I'm looking forward to season 2.,7
East Asia,"The games were thoughtful and the politics outside of them were also very enjoyable to watch, but unfortunately the last 2 episodes didn't do it for me. It didn't make any sense, just felt like a forced, cheap way out + we haven't gotten any information of matter about the creators of the game or the sudden disappearing of everyone in Tokyo.",7
East Asia,"Thought it was all good until around episode 4/5, but the characters they introduced let it down, really poor acting too for what should be dramatic. The Beach episodes ruined he show.",6
East Asia,"Not only Netflix bad subtitles, terrible dub acting, and/or cultural differences but terrible over the top acting, nonsensical plot, poor writing, mediocre CGI and cringe fest all over the place makes this one of the worst thing I saw this year , If not ever.I'm writing this while watching epiode 6 and really trying to stick it to the end to see what sort of mess they come up with at the end, but it's tough.I wish IMDB had a feature where you have to put your age when rating as these higher rating reviews must be from really young kids, who shouldn't be watching violence anyway.",1
East Asia,"OMG! Dumbest thing I've seen this year. First episode, I enjoyed. Second episode, I started feeling like fast forwarding. Third episode, I started fast forwarding and didn't stop till the end.",2
East Asia,"If you've watched Squid Game, personally I thought this was much better. The games take place in a variety of locations and generally the show is a little bit more darker...The end of the season gets a little OTT on the storyline, but I thought it's well made. And I believe the reason for the existence of the games, is a bit more creative that Squid Games.Lower budget, but more entertaining personally.",9
East Asia,"What a dissapointment. Really bad acting, bad Screenplay, bad storyline, just not that good at all.Some fun moment, and nice visuals, But just a huge dissapointment. At least after Squid Game.",4
East Asia,"Alice in borderland is a science fiction and drama series. It's an Japanese series. It was directed by shinsuke Sato. It was released in 2020 on Netflix there are 1 season and 8 episode
The series star kuina as Aya Sabina, Ann as ayaka miyoshi and ryohei arisu as kento Yamazaki
A young man passionate about video games finds himself with his two friends in an alternative Tokyo where they must play dangerous games to survive.",8
East Asia,"As others have written, the first 4 episodes are great. There's a nice intimate, mysterious atmosphere. Then episode 5 completely destroys it as the show turns into an over the top anime basically, and never returns to the tone set in the first half.",5
East Asia,"It started great.. but the last episodes were just disappointing. The main girl character went from being so smart in the beginning turning to an useless character in the end.I don't understand the idea of creating a place call ""the beach"", and why in the last episodes we have to waste so much time digging into these killers' past? Seriously, didnt make any sense and didnt contribute to the story.The connections between two bosses of the Beach are not developed clearly. And the reasons for killing at the Beach episodes are just ridiculous. Half of the time you will have to hear the past stories of the killers, while the two main characters - one is running around the hotel doing nothing special. The other is tied up most of the time and just cried about his friends death from like 3 eps ago.Many people may say the games in this movie are better than in Squid games. It's just harder, not better. The way Squid game builds their characters are just amazing, turning even boring and easy kids game into a creepy survival situation.",5
East Asia,"I mean...it's Bollywood-bad. It's just horrible all around from plot to screenplay, story and acting. The plot leaps over unplausible hurdles to create a downright stupid, childish story that runs of in evey possible direction. It COULD have been Tron-, Matrix- or Cube-believable, but turns in to complete ludacris. I mean, whoever wrote the outline had to be a drunk, childish hentai-fan that just wanted to portray the ""games"" with as much blood as possible with no concern as to how we got there. The huge problem with that is the whole thing crumbles on itself without clever writing or a plausible twist, even for a sci-fi! Then, in raging panic I presume, they try to put at least some substance in to a flapping story by shoving toothpaste back in the tube and jamming some malpositioned flashbacks in to the end-scenes of the last two episodes, sucking whatever air was left out of the room.To top it all up the manuscript is so flawed, so incredible amateuriatic and thin that a 14 year old comicbook-fan could do a better job under the influence of hormones. Even worse - the dialog and acting is far, FAR below anything I have ever seen professional actors do. It's so extremly over-acted and thin (even for low budget asian standards) it's embarrassing, and quite frankly - boring throughout the whole thing. The only reason I stuck it out for eight episodes of the same ""gung-ho-child-with-a-gun"" BS was to see if they managed to tie something together in the end. Nuuuup. Flying blimps with cards on 'em, sweaty teenagers with fake fear and/or courage on their faces and a plot-twist to drag things out for the money. This is so God awful that the original Battle Royale looks like an Oscar-movie. I've had enough over-acted, screaming, teenage, collage-project for the rest of my life. Let's just hope the same goes for Netflix.",1
East Asia,"Yeah as it said in the headline ""don't be fooled"" by 7.7 rating (as of 16/10/21) rating. It actually is pretty bad. Had me going thinking it would lead to something but nothing at all. Guess it was a take on squid game since both nations have a bit of rivalry going on, doesn't even come close to squid game.",3
East Asia,"I previously watched squid game and was looking for a series like this. In the first episodes i thought it could get near to it. A difference to Squid game is that it is not realistic as that. People are killed from lasers from sky, time traveling be like situations and randomly all people except from the players disappear.But this is okay i think, its unrealistic like the dragons in game of thrones: it couldnt be in real life, but if the other plot is comprehenseble its ok.And this is the point: After some episodes the fight scenes and the acts are sooooo horrible unrealistic that the whole plot doesnt make sense. Best example here is a scene where people get haunted by other ones with guns. They can knock them out ( this is also veeeery unrealistic) but instead of getting their guns they are running away like the blonde girl in b horror movies and are just waiting for the attackers to wake up and shoot them. At the point where scenes like this started to occur i began to hate this series more and more. Very frustating to watch.",6
East Asia,"The first game in the show is a total nonsense with unsolvable puzzle that can be solved only through confusing and impossible thought process that no one in the world could achieve. How do you even start a movie/series with something totally unrealistic when later more realism is possible?There are generally a lot of logical holes with characters acting irrationally, while the whole concept of the series is based on confusing sci-fi, again with lots of logical issues and impossibilities.However, once you get through all the issues and keep watching, you can get used to the show's weaknesses and may be able to enjoy it. In the end, there are tons of totally nonsensical & low-budget shows out there, making Alice in Borderland feel moderately smart. High-budget and decent acting also helps.",6
East Asia,Season 1The anime memes are real. The last game felt like it was never going to end. The whole show is very predictable. My girlfriend and I both guessed at the very beginning of the 10 of hearts challenge that she killed herself and that should be the first body to throw on the fire. How did not one person think of that?Season 2I feel like Arisu is trying really hard to be a real life anime dude. The way he runs and his facial expressions just don't seem natural at all. The pacing of season 2 is god awful so far. 1 game was broken up between 3 episodes is far too much. It didn't need to be that long.,3
East Asia,"For someone who watched anime just casually and only knows the really cliché ones, this series feels exactly like one of those.From the acting to the whole scenario, it's just so over the top sometimes, it's still kinda good, but really too much sometimes.",6
East Asia,"Started somehow interesting and with suspense. Lots of story gaps and scenes that didn't make sense lead to worse and worse episodes towards the end. Quite disappointed with the wasted time at the end, definitely not looking forward to waste more time with another season.I really don't get your good reviews, must have watched a different show...",3
East Asia,"I really don't understand all the good reviews. The first few episodes were OK. But then it goes downhill very rapidly. People saying it's better than squid game clearly don't understand why squid game has such a wide appeal.The characters aren't likeable, most of the actors cannot act, and they have most of the females characters running around in bikinis, so I guess that's why some types of people like it.Could barely finish watching it.",2
East Asia,Please finish it. It really gets better! I loved it. Yhe first few episodes come slow but then it really becomes interesting. This is kind of show I freaking love.,10
East Asia,"Protagonist that is A gamer, with smart quirks but looks generic, transported into another world-time where he cant cope with reality until it takes it as a game and starts collecting rewards while people with other skills are killed, except that one love-interest. Someone who knows electronics? Nah. Corporate cutthroat? Nah. Street-smart guy? Nah. A climber? Sounds useful. The first one to die? A schoolgirl, because they are dum and you want gamer teenagers that are smart. I mean, I love isekai stories, this one is just not a good one, it is meh. Protagonist's superpower is also crying and delaying hard choices because they are hard till too late, which is not particularly attractive.Also, story is just plain. In first challenge every time they have to solve something, they will to it last second. I mean, I get it if you do it once, but always? Some parts are low tech (fried chips) but you get ultragear that looks quite breakable for just a few games? And even most simple of challenges are designed so most people, like 99% will probably fail them, so I dont quite get it ... if you win higher lvl challenges, you are ... because protagonist is just generic. He is not ultrasmart, ultrastrong, ultraskilled or ultrakind (when he gets to kill his friends, he does it, he comes around only after story-shield activates). And that cutthroat ... why? I mean, why did that boy attack her? Why did she chose to target him if he is the weakest of them all, I mean, I get it, he is the weakest of them all, but it would be in her interest to use him to get closer to the group, but instead she acts spoiled. And the most obvious flaw ... the most logical organisation for any group would be to divide labor according to skill, no one is master of everything so strongest of groups would have a strong leader, fighter, smart guy, caretaker etc., they would be well organised to tackle any challenge. But this game has a hearts challenge that is 1/4 of all challenges, meaning such groups will be the first to get wiped out. But no one is skilled in everything so you will get killed anyway more you play those games? More you play, less likely you are to survive. I mean, imagine someone is capable of that but is just too kind to let other people die on their own. So if you win, you are ... what does that tell about you. It is like game is tailored against everything, but in particular against a society and if you are to survive it, I honestly dont want you to survive it.So ... isekai with a meh story for people that dont enjoy anime. What did I learn from it? If you are indecisive and generic enough, people might take pity on you, so why not try that? Poor you. I mean, everyone else will die as a result, because kindness gets you killed, but good for you.",5
East Asia,"This show had a great start, every episode made me want more. Every game had me thinking and routing for the charcters, the complexity and the easiness of each game really kept me going. The character writing was great until the beach arc where things got a little rough... I'm ot necessarily saying that the beach arc was made but it couldve been more clean and smooth and overall done better. They kept forgetting certain points that were to remebered from previous epsiodes which was quite annoying. The charcter writing for this arc was great, somthing new each episode. They lift at us on an almost cliff-hanger here, which really made us want more but to my own suprise there will be no season two for almsot an year or so if i'm correct. The acting and sets were great, very fitting and well-made. 8/10 would recommend to anyine who wants something short to binge which will distract them for a while.",8
East Asia,"I'm not sure that I watched the same show that those who gave 10 stars saw.I'll briefly describe what I saw. 3 'losers' hide in a bathroom stall and get thrown into an alternate version of their world where the only people who survived were those who look good in a bikini. Even though everyone is gone and stores are fully stocked the office girl continues to wear heels and work clothes in life-or-death physical games. Episode 3 was supposed to be heart breaking but we are not invested enough into these characters to care if they die. Just because you laugh and eat ramen together doesn't mean you are a great person. The first 4 episodes were interesting because of the games but then in episode 5 the show becomes a frat party and switches to something completely different. It's high school drama class, literally everyone is the same age, the same height, the same hair, its hard to tell the characters apart. The bad acting gets worse, in comes cult-leader guy, CSI girl, inked swordsman and the return of the violent thug and blond dude who is kinda cool (has anime hair). The Tarantino-loving creators pour on the violence, so much so that its just boring and not effective.The only interesting character is the former wedding gown salesgirl who brings a cell phone to a sword fight, and of course always wearing a bikini. Even rock climbing girl is not interesting although she traps and eats rabbit instead of free food from abandon stores. Which brings me to the main character, Arisu, besides also having anime hair-style he doesn't really fit or carry the series and seems more like a spectator. He is surrounded by idiots to make his look better. But he likes to scream a lot and can take a beating.Games are clever but only solved through random and specific info that only Arisu knows, this means that the audience can only spectate and not play along.The final episodes are drawn out with flashbacks that come too late and don't add to the story.I am reviewing and rating this as a standalone series, if you have to read the book or be into manga to appreciate this series then it failed as a storytelling show. I am not rating the SFX or dubbing, that would bring the rating even lower.I guess this is intended for teens but with all the violence, suicide, sex, rape, torture, sexism and mass shootings I wouldn't recommend it.",3
East Asia,"The first few episodes were quite good and it went downhill from there. Very unrealistic and like a real life anime, which some people will enjoy but it's not for me.",4
East Asia,"I'm 5 episodes into the show, and I can't get myself to continue watching. The show started nicely, but quickly collapsed into a confusing and somewhat boring story, which was quite intimidating.",1
East Asia,"I caught myself skipping a lot especially towards the end just to finish off this boring fest of brutal and useless now pseudo cartoon. Its so bad. This thing is cold. In a bad way, boring, character developement basically doesnt exist, games are boring and its way over sexualised for no reason. Like a cheap japanese snuff film.",2
East Asia,"Absurd, Slow, Senseless, Illogical, Slow, BORING, Stupid, Excruciatingly slow (If one shot is meant to be shown for 3 seconds they've wasted 7 seconds on it..) Annoying.. Misleading ratings by bots and androids.. Doesn't even deserve 1 star.. Did I mention slow? Big waste of time! Zero star!",1
East Asia,"Alice in Borderland
Season 1Three men who all have a mediocre life to it suddenly morphing into a nightmare of games...Three young men who are fiends are finding their way in life, one going nowhere, one bored with their job and and who just lost their job whom all are still trying to find the fun in life together. When they're together, they forget their problems.Suddenly their lives change when the lights go out and it's quiet. New technology is broken, with no one in sight, what is happening!?Living in a dark city, with three days apart to play the next game, fighting for the chance of freedom and safety, they must work as a team in order to survive each game. If you don't pass the game, you die. If you fail during the game you die.Will they turn on each other or work together to survive...Escape the dark city and end the games, or forever play and try to continuously survive like a nightmare of ground hog day over and over again.Who is the creator of the game?FOUND - a room in the railway station with cameras and computers, with a bunch of random people watching on the games of the death and survival of those playing. Once thinking they were the game masters - WRONG. They were also pawns used in this game. A woman suddenly appears on the computer screens and is dictating the final games. Who is she? Another pawn?So many questions!? I believe Chishiya (the blonde male) has been relatively calm throughout the entire game... does he have something to do with it?? Is this another Dark City type film where the human population have been taken from the world to another fake world?? The biggest question is where are the lasers coming from and who is controlling them as they're coming from the sky. This is why I believe it is a fake world. Unless there are satellite type objects in the sky being controlled by computers on the ground.? Are they aliens controlling this new world?? Is it Arisu's father/brother teaching him a lesson to do something in his life?The FINALS -A deck of cards were used to depict every game's level of intensity from easy to hard and also the genre - emotional. All numbered cards are played, with the death of most players under its belt, the final players will play the remaining face cards - who will survive the final games?...Season 2 to hopefully reveal.",8
East Asia,"How is this rated so high? It started off really good with good character development but fell off flat. It has more plot holes than you can shake a stick at. The killing of the main characters, for what? There is no gain to it. The games make no sense and the beach makes even less sense. For instance how does the woman now the answer to the flood light bulb game yet they don't yet have that card. There's thousands of people there yet they still need loads of cards. There are 58 players in the last game but only 12 phones, they save a phone for Arisu but then Aguni and his crew come who haven't taken a phone.. Then about 100 people are killed, when killing people wouldn't have won the game anyway because they needed throwing on the fire.",2
East Asia,Definitely interesting! I'm hooked and awaiting the next season.There were parts that were slow and strange and a little repetitive but overall entertaining and cool.,8
East Asia,"I've been on a drama binge following Squid Game and after watching both that and Sweet Home Alice in Borderlands was good follow-up! The story and setup are simple, high IQ Shut-in and his buddies get trapped in a copy of Tokyo where they play games to survive, nothing new but exciting none the less.Story: The plots nothing crazy. The first episode does well in setting up both the main group and the games. Something to note was chemistry of the main 3 boys. It's great, it's so real, you'll get attached to them and their persona very quickly as their dynamic is pretty relatable. The games, start strong. This show isn't crazy gory but the first death is chilling and gets you amped to see how the games progress. The games overall are pretty fun to watch as they're all puzzles that you'll definitely say ""huh, how"" as our MC blows through them.Characters: They're great! The choice in actors and their performances were very well done. The sad and depressing scenes had me SAD and the intense moments at the edge of my seat. You could tell the actors were in tune with their characters and it made the show all the better.Overall: Alice in Borderlands is a great show with a simple premise, fun and interesting games, great acting and engaging cast. When season 2 drops, i'm going to be right on it!",9
East Asia,I've done something like this also in my creative writing class. I start with a great story with interesting characters and a unique premise only to realize I can't find a logical ending to tie it all together. So I throw a bunch of nonsensical crap at it and hope the teacher doesn't notice. C-,5
East Asia,"While there isn't any nudity, there's a lot of women only shown wearing almost nothing. Guys are almost fully clothed.The show is filled with long crying scenes. And the logic in the series is just broken.Overall, it's entertaining not bad.Cannot be compared to Squid Game for sure.",5
East Asia,"It is a little long-drawn, like an anime, but thats the japanese production. It is much more exciting and entertainment than the Squid Game.It is undervalued compared to squid game.",10
East Asia,"This series started off great but became more generic and less interesting around episode 5: the writing started to feel quite forced. I still finished and enjoyed it. I'd say it started at an 8 but was a 5 or 6 before it ended. So, averaging out to 6 or 7.",7
East Asia,"There's no question that this is a very good series for fans of this genre but it also unquestionably falls short in some key areas that prevent it from being a 8.5+. Right away, you'll get that nice feeling of familiarity because you've probably watched the likes of Saw, Battle Royal, Cube or maybe you've just finished watching Squid games and are now open to the idea of fighting through subtitles and horrible dubs in search of older but watchable material from foreign entities.What we have here with Alice In Borderland is a fresh take on the classic survival scheme at the hands of a mysterious and largely unknown force. The acting is superb, casting is spot on and the story is healthy, but man oh man did they ever miss an opportunity with the death scenes!Time and time again you'll see the same 3 things play out while expecting something more to give you that same shock and awe that you got the first time you watched Cube or maybe one of the Saw movies. Here you do have a lot more dramatic tension and better acting but the effects and demise of characters is blatantly unimaginative. That'll not only does this. Quickly become repetitious, but it also causes things to get rather predictable.If there's a season 2 (and I suspect there will be) if they're able to turn pump the gore and effects to match other current shows such as The Boys, Brand New Cherry Flavour, and some of the classics that I previously mentioned, they should be able to add that extra Umph, really shock the audiences, then we will have a timeless classic.Still worth watching though, and I should give them credit for adding more of an element of mystery which seems to have been lost up until episode 6 at least.",8
East Asia,"However if you are Otaku change the grade to 9/10. Very immersive, very inventive, and very Japanese (requirement for beach outfit? Insane!). Highly recommended!",8
East Asia,"The first 4 episodes were okay, and you want to look how it keeps going,
BUTE the final 4 episodes....like another series ?So i give only 7 stars because of the first 4 episodes, and hope that the second season will be better.Have potential, which for me was wasted in the second half.We will see how it goes on.",7
East Asia,"Half naked Asians in swimsuit, villain with tattoos & anger issues, the cool boss with sunglasses, female side character with obsession to the main character, everything a teenager would look for is included. The acting was okay but the atmosphere and the way the story got told didnt catch my interest and was kinda dry, especially in the last episodes. We also dont get any explanation about unrealistic stuff that happens in the movie, but also the plot twist is... missing? The ending could be a hint for season 2, so we get more about the plot twist in the following season but not sure if i will watch it.",6
East Asia,"Most of the games were really cool, the show went downhill the last couple of episodes. The acting got pretty bad and beach part was also boring. They also stretched the episodes alot by having the smart characters explain everything to the others who are extremely dumb.",6
East Asia,"I understand this show doesn't suit everybody, but for the people who like these kinds of shows, I would say besides some of the puzzles being a bit too obvious this shows magnitude and detail is so immense it will have you at the edge of your seat through your entire watch especially episode 3 and 8.Definitely a must see 10/10.",10
East Asia,"This is a poor man's version of Squid Game. Horrible writing, horrible acting, full of plot holes and inconsistencies. It is decent in the first couple of episodes and then goes downhill from here. At moments it is obvious the writers are just trying to drag it out.",1
East Asia,"What a waste of time ! Trying to be like ""squid game"" except that it has nothing to do with it.Very badly acted, scenario completely stupid.... Really no interest.Please if you want to spare some time do not watch it.Otherwise good luck...",1
East Asia,"That's the first time I got deceived by an imdb rating. 7,5? Really? More like 1,5 for the effort only. This show is slow, boring and has no content for long 45min episodes. Seriously, none of the episodes had content for more than 15-20 minutes. It was a pain to watch, even skipping a lot of extremely irrelevant scenes. What a joke.",1
East Asia,This show is way better than squid game i just loved everyone's acting i just can't wait to see season 2 hope it comes soon. I would love too Kento Yamazaki in more shows he's a great actor.,10
East Asia,"After squid game i came to know about this series. And this one is not as good as squid game but yet it has a lot of potential. From the get go, it keeps you on the edge of your seat and keeps you guessing what is really happening. But till the end you can't guess what's really happening. It is a good series with decent acting and suspenseful drama.",8
East Asia,"I just don't get the hype, far to compare with squid game, not even close.It's just not make sense from the start, how the main character (I don't know + don't care what his name) so easy leave his home and become homeless boy instantly, the meet his 2 friends and the world change to strange instantly, and the boys just seem to be careless, then...the game just begin with the ridiculous way.",1
East Asia,"This is ridiculous TV show that not make any sense at all.Yeah I know this is manga base movie, but this is just too overacted and overrated.For example from beginning, the main character (I don't know and don't care what his name) was so easily make decisions to become a homeless instantly, the again instantly meet his 2 friends, then instantly the world change become strange, and again INSTANTLY they didn't show any shock but careless and seem happy, and again INSTANTLY they ""in"" to the ""ridiculous games"" and so on...Just forget this show, not even close to squid game at all, never ever can be compared.",1
East Asia,"There are Series on Netflix that you have high hopes for or just seems good, but end up flat on their Faces when you finally watch it. On the other Hand, there are Series that you don't have a lot of expectations or know little about, but turn out to be a really big surprise.This is one of those Series, I just tried it out and it turns out to be one of the best Series I have seen this Year. It is a Mystery-Action-Adventure-Thriller about a group of Friends who end up in a Place where they are forced to participate in Games that result in Life or Death.Each Game is unique and thus have to be solved in a relatively unique way also. The Pacing, Storytelling, Characterizations, Acting, etc. Are all pretty good, there's not a lot of dull moments in the Episodes, there's always something interesting happening.It is like squid game but its better than that. I really recommend it to those who are fan of squid game.",9
East Asia,"I really wanted to like this one, but by experience I know that live action from manga are always cringe worthy with extremely rare exception. This one didn't made the cut.Bad acting and bad written character. I mean come on, you are in an empty Tokyo and you hunt rabbit in TOKYO and live in a warehouse...as much as the character only characteristics is her connection with mountain, that's stupid.Main character is not even likable, just a whiny looser.",3
East Asia,This was a fantastic show and kept me gripped to the end. Binged it in a couple of days and loved every minute of it. The show is exciting and keeps you guessing till the end and has some good and upsetting twists along the way. Fingers crossed I don't have to wait to long for season two.,10
East Asia,"I watched the show right after squid game, as suggested by some friends. I found that the only thing they remotely had in common was the game theme and the asian production. They took a somewhat ingaging premise, even if quite derivative, and then dragged a bland and ridiculous episode after the other.The characters were cliché and dull, and after almost 8 excruciating hours I couldn't care less if they lived or died. Even the ""genius"" otaku main character was really inconsistent, and went from superhumanly smart (in order to justify some absurd plot twist) to umbelievably dumb, to the point of forgetting the type of the game he's in or not noticing giant clues right in front of his face. I could go on for days just listing the nonsense sequences, stupid and pointless dialogues and over the top drama.And I forced myself to carry on hoping to get a minimal explanation, a resolution, something. But it ended with another useless cliffhanger, setting up the same tone for the second season. Needless to say I won't waste anymore time to see it.",2
East Asia,"If 0 was an option to put it would still be waaaay to high for this waste of time. Borring, no real plot, unrealistic characters, many inconsistiences. The worst series I watched on Nectflix and believe me I am really keen on watching bad Netflix.",1
East Asia,"I binged through this due to a flu infect and I liked it. There are too many illogical flaws in it to be a masterpiece though. For example:during the first game where they meet the Beach people in the appartment complex, why didn't the ""military people"" bring any weapons? There wasn't a rule to don't bring any, wasn't it?with the existance of Hearts games and the reason that you do not know before the game whether you enter a Hearts game, why on earth would you bring friends? That's complete BS.the head of the Beach, they told us ""why didn't he bring some soldiers"" after he died. Well, because of the Hearts games? Was he supposed to have people willingly die for him?And several more... also the end was too dragged out. They should have done the last two episodes in one and skipped a lot of the obvious drama. Overall it was fun, LF season 2.",7
East Asia,"I watched this after getting caught up in the Squid game hype, it came up as a suggestion on Netflix and it was far superior to its Korean counterpart in my opinion. Fast paced, gory,intriguing storyline etc. Highly recommend.",8
East Asia,"The show has a very strong start at a fast pace with an unique approach of the genre. One can't really ask more than that. But then, all the premises fall very soon by changing the style of the story too soon. Basically, from episode 1 to episode 3 is Season 1, and the rest is Season 2. The biggest problem I've had is that the ""games"" are often too complicated which makes me confused rather than being engaged in the activities and feeling the suspense. The best example is the games in SAW series. The games are simple but deadly. It's all about the execution. There's only one way and you know how to win the game. Of course they differentiated the games in this show by making them more like sophisticated puzzles, but then again were they trying to show up their writing skills, or let people enjoy the show? Ever since, Death Note released, a similar troupe has been introduced in many media in Japan. At this moment they just want to show up their intelligence. ""Look, how smart we are."" Okay, I get it, but don't you want to use your intelligence to make the show more enjoyable like Seinfeld? Even though the show has a nice stylish setting, but it doesn't live up to it because again their focus is making the show look smart. Also there too many behind the stories of minor characters. Oh, by the way, where are the older people in this show?",4
East Asia,"The first and second episode were ok. Then the descent began, in my opinion. Something that offended me completely as a human was that they abused the female body, which at the same time makes me think about the position of women in Japanese society.",1
East Asia,"I really liked Arisu and his smartness, especially in the first game ""Dead or living"". His reasoning ability was so strong enough to solve how to know witch doors lead to death and witch not. I was pretty suprised how the ending was so weird. I were thinking that it would be just so Arisu gets an infinite visa. Kinda sad how Arisu's friends died in third episode. Anyway fun series 8/10. GOOD.",8
East Asia,"I liked the atmosphere of Alice in Borderland very much. They have built a sort of dystopian feeling in the series that carried through all episodes. There was energy in the beginning and the plot was getting thicker towards the end. In between the series lost it a bit, and some twists in the plot and solutions to tasks came somewhat out of the blue. A nice series though, yet not as good as Squid Game about the same theme in my opinion.",7
East Asia,It's not similar to squid game but it is wonderful one. The half episodes were great but after they go to the beach I found it quite boring. But it's great. You can surely go for it.,8
East Asia,"The issue of false reviews to help hyping a show is becoming a worry. This way we can't trust a rating anymore, we will just make up our mind watching. This would mean the end for IMDB. This show is boring, stupid and useless. Just watch this if you run out of sleeping pills.Yawn.",1
East Asia,"I was really compelled to watch this show, but they killed off some major protagonist Arisu's friends early in the show just for shock value. If they killed them off later I would of felt less upset, its like the author could have used them to make the story more compelling and build on them, but he just threw it away. I was turned off by it.",6
East Asia,"I started very good and it was very promising but after the few first episodes, I felt disappointed. It could be better.Kento was pretty good as well as some other actors.",8
East Asia,"While looking for other recommended series on IMDB, I came across this one in particular. After investigating a bit deeply, it gave me at first some ""Squid Game"" vibes, which I'd observed a few months ago and left me with a very bittersweet experience. However, I decided to give it the benefit of doubt to see how it played out. Eight chapters later, I can say without hesitation that despite not having the high popularity of its South Korean counterpart, ""Alice in Borderland"" is a superior series and by far.Although it bears some similarities with ""Squid Game"" in terms of plot despite being released a year before the latter, the difference is that the creators of ""Alice in Borderland"" planned and executed it carefully, while maintaining its fidelity to the same-named manga most of the time. As a result, the plot never fell short or felt unstable during Season 1 and the plot twists were literally brutal and surprising. Furthermore, they didn't skimp of creativity, suspense and tension factors (especially when it come to the games), something that kept me glued to the chair to see what happens next.Regarding the characters, this was perhaps one of the series' characteristics that stood out by far. The creators did a flawless job in the way they were presented to the audience, especially when they gave us the chance to see their life backgrounds through flashbacks, whether they were main or secondary. They also scored high in terms of showing an authentic chemistry between themselves (especially with Arisu and Usagi) to the point of connecting with the audience progressively and the individual character development on each one of them. Here I want to highlight an aspect and is related to Hikari's case. Although I was surprised to find out that she was trans (since I thought she was a woman all that time), the creators of the series didn't excessively focus on her sexuality or gender as it generally occurs in western series, but more on her abilities and capacities like anyone else. So I give them high props.Ultimately, if you were one of the people who liked ""Squid Game"" or felt that the aforementioned series partially met or did not meet expectations at the end, I highly recommend that you watch ""Alice in Borderland"". I assure you that you'll love it. As for me, count me in to watch Season 2.",9
East Asia,"If you Battle Royale, you will love this. I don't know why i delayed watching this for so long. I became hooked after watching the first episode. Yes, you will see resemblance to Squid Game which is a show that I love, but i think Alice in Borderland is better (in terms of gore and plot). Can't wait for Season 2.",9
East Asia,The best show I've ever seen! I've also read the manga. The whole show was incredibly well adapted to the manga. On the other hand there's one thing I'm hoping for as a Koudai Tatta fan. Maybe please give that boy more screen time .,10
East Asia,"This is probably one of the best series I have ever watched, it is very original and entertaining.The film quality, acting and script writing is beyond beautiful and it really puts you on the edge of your seat.I also appreciate the changes they made from the manga, as I feel it is an improvement, and I pray that the ending will be changed as well as I genuinely hated it in the manga. Either way, Netflix played magic on the manga and I trust them. I 100% recommend this series.",10
East Asia,"How far will people go to stay alive? What burdens are they willing to heap upon body, mind, and soul to cling to this fragile existence? At what point does the cost build to a point where one will no longer be willing to pay the price a situation demands. What then? Will they resign themselves to the cruel hands of fate? Or will the human spirit prove itself powerful enough to not only find a way out, but forge one if need be. Considering both its respective books and series, Alice in Borderland is the rise of a new era of death games capable of capturing both apocalyptic and survival horror. The series owns a high profile in the actual design, plot, execution of the games, choice of music, filming, and developing intriguing characters.",9
East Asia,"Have you watched ""Squid Game""? YOu'll love ""Alice in Borderland"" for sure; it's Japanese with American voice dubbing, in a less annoying manner than our British cousins attempting those awkward Asian/English translations you see. The suspense is quite captivating and fascinating to watch at times. It's now very bloody, but rather relies on the acting and emphasis on hand gesturing. I think this is a winner here, as I give it two thumbs up. Cheers, and enjoy, Murf.",10
East Asia,"The crime about this series is that it is only 8 episodes for the first season.I usually know if I will like a show within the first 5 - 10 minutes because I respond most to character. Alice in Borderland establishes all its driving characters very well. You want to spend your time watching these people.In terms of story, the show moves at a very consistent pace. Each episode has well marked out thrills while the overarching storyline fits seemlessly into the mix.The stakes are always high in Alice in Borderland with worthwhile pay-offs. I'm excited for season 2.",9
East Asia,I simply have no words. This is in my top 5 favourite shows of all time and it definitely deserves it. The atmosphere the characters the story everything is simply put together to create this amazing show. I would talk more but i would have to spoil its manga so no.,10
East Asia,Brilliant ! Non stop action blood and guts! I really got into squid game but this is on another level! Game ideas are warped! Fully recommend. Can't wait for season 2!,10
East Asia,Watched this show before squid games and it's honestly so much better and deserves the hype. They aren't comparable in all ways though. I like the originality of the card deck and different type of games based on suits. Definitely plays with your heart in all of the good and bad ways.,10
East Asia,"Alice in Borderland is one hell of a crazy project. From the setting of the place that is not playing, the actors are many, and the story is very good. Actually, there are already many films of the same type. Like The Cabin in the Woods one of them. And the games here are fun and meaningful. But this is too fantasy. Actually, fantasy is okay. But it's the type of fantasy that makes us think, ""I guess this is really really impossible."" How come. Stories like this usually have a character who manages everything. But because the setting is unbelievably extensive, which group can try to manage this? If that's the case, only God can do that. But actually, there is one plausible possibility and if it doesn't happen it will be even more disappointing. Namely, the characters in this series are in a virtual world, and they are sleeping in the real world. But it's okay. Luckily there is a second season. Hopefully it's much more exciting and challenging.",6
East Asia,"The only annoying part of this excellent Japanese TV series is you are given no explanation, in visual or spoken form, of how - and why - it is that the Card Game of Death participants were secreted away to an empty Tokyo. Other than that this is an absolutely terrific watch! Episode 6 is the only part (to date) that was a little slow and quite meaningless but all the others are a riveting view...at different paces and twists as you make guesses about each of the main characters. A few flashbacks give you history about some of them but, the show begins with the leading actor sat playing games, on his PC, in the real world environment...until he is magically dropped into a wacky situation of an ""Escape Room"" adventure...except that its Escape City, Tokyo!One of the things I liked is the actors were all blending well together and, they played the parts of what people would absolutely be like in real life in a similar situation. There's a little of a ""Purge"", ""Hunger Games"", ""Escape Room"", ""Battle Royale"" and ""Lord of the Flies"" feel to it all. It knocks the socks off anything coming out of America (which is not hard to do these days).Play the insanely twisted mad game and stay alive, to pick up the playing card, and do the same again the next day are the simple rules; except its not as simple when you have a few wack jobs, killers and devious backstabbers playing also!Television at its finest; in Japanese and dubbed English language versions.",9
East Asia,"As per the tradition of Japanese anime, the narration is character-driven despite them being all utterly depthless and unoriginal. Every possible tedious manga cliché you could think of: the Hikikomori character who must overcome his insecurities, the insuferable dork who loses his virginity to a desperate sex bomb, the.big-hearted bosozoku, the mysterious white-haired teenager, etc. The acting is atrocious (though I must admit I watched it dubbed, so perhaps take this one bit a grain of salt), and at any rate the script string platitudes that would make any YA film sound like f'ing Shakespear. The world-building so far is mediocre (Im at EP3), a shotgun wedding of Harsh Realm and Battle Royal, without the grit of the first nor the minimalism of the second.Animes are rarely 'good stories' - when they are 'good animes' it is usually because they are redeemed by spectacular graphic feats, or because the freedom afforded by drawing allows what a camera couldn't. Animes or mangas adaptation are usually terrible, most of them basically just fan-service, the rest being vacuous action flicks. This series belongs to the later.",2
East Asia,"Nessa analise me baseei em 5 importantes pontos: Enredo, desenvolvimento, personagens, estética e entretenimento.Enredo: 2/2.Desenvolvimento: 1/2.Estética: 2/2.Personagens: 1/2.Entretenimento: 2/2.",8
East Asia,"Dystopian survival thrillers is a genre that is personally a minimum guarantee content for me. Take Hunger Games, Maze Runner, Squid Game and AiB...All of them are atleast worth watching once. AiB is the best of all these I'd definitely say. Right from the very first episode ( The first 10 minutes drags the narrative though ) , it grows in you and makes a better bingewatching experience than Squid Game.",9
East Asia,"Why, in the ever living holy hell, couldn't a single good guy simply pick up a gun from a fallen enemy in this entire show. It's infuriating to watch.",7
East Asia,"One of the best show in the survival game based genre. Very entertaining. If you already watched Squid game and liked it, then you might love this show too.After finishing this show, you might think, this is even better than squid game ??",7
East Asia,"No one care about character,story or anything else there is only 2,3 games that aren't that bad and make u watch next episode but everything besides that is absolute garbage like soooo dump for example in e7 or e8 a guy punch tiger and tiger get knock out!!!",2
East Asia,"It's pretty obvious that this show is geared toward teens and pre-teens. The writing looks to be the product of a 10 year old. It's replete with mind numbing gore, scantily clad women, and over the top action. Mind you, I don't mind any of those things, when done well. Unfortunately, ""done well"" is not in the vocabularies of anyone associated with this project. I do have to admit, however, that I laughed many times at the moronic story and imbecilic plot. Also, the dialog was atrocious, but that could be due to poor translation.Edit 12/26/2022:
Not sure what possessed me to do it, but I watched season 2 hoping that things might have improved. After all, I enjoyed the premise of the series, as well as the individual episodes; the writers were just incapable of actually bringing their vision to life. It still has huge plot holes, stupid characters, and horribly boring and inane dialogue; but it was slightly better than season 1 ( I was going to raise my rating from two stars to three). But then we came to the big confrontation with the King of Spades. That episode has to be one of the worst TV episodes I've ever watched. They used every action/fight cliche imaginable, and not in a good way. People died, then they were alive again, then dead again. OMG, I almost ripped out every hair in my mostly bald head.Then to top it all off, they ended with a truly dreadful and mind numbing final episode. After that, I considered lowering my rating to a one, but decided I'd leave at two since not every episode sucked.",2
East Asia,"After episode one you might suspect this one of those series whith a repetitive pattern in each next episode, in this case, a new game they need to survive, but this is not the case. Each episode brings new plot twists and character developments, making you want to watch the next one, the hallmark of a good series. Deserves a second season to tie things up, which is coming this year it looks.",8
East Asia,"The beginning has great cinematographies and a decent a plotline that is puzzling and fairly engaging. But like a lot of people mentioned in their reviews, after the casts arrived at beach later in the season, the show just completely forgot its realism and turns every support character into clueless peons. The actors at beach are also quite bad characters that defy logic and reasons. All in all, if you don't think when you watch shows, this is definitely the show for you.",6
East Asia,The show is great the first 15minutes r insanely stupid. And then they bloat the episodes HEAVILY with unneeded backstory. Its unneeded because its backstories of sidecharacters that are about to die in like 3 minutes which ruins the pacing heavily.,7
East Asia,"I wasn't even a little bit impressed. Only the main character knew how to act but even saying that feels like I'm giving him too much credit. I was not attached to a single character and even when we finally figured out who one of the major game operator was, I wasn't even shocked because the drama made no effort to make any character memorable so I was like « who tf is even this lmao » Don't bother with this just watch Squid Game. Only reason why I gave 2 stars was because the episodes were pretty short compared to the usual shows i watch which means I got through it faster.",2
East Asia,"A lot of people compare squid game to this but I don't think it's really comparable. Except for the game thing but it's like a drama vs show based on manga. So there are some weird characters who look like no one in our world, some weird reaction, action and fight sometime (often) not realistic but cool. Lot of flashback while people are fighting lol (just like an anime).Sometime, the reactions of characters are just like... why the hell he's doing this? LolBut the show was fun and we want to know who's behind all of this.",8
East Asia,"I can't say that it is boring in any case. The first half was very interesting, after a certain point far fetched. Perhaps if it was planned for one season instead of two it could be much better. Not a master piece but not trashy either. I watched it pleasantly, but i am afraid what the second season will be.",5
East Asia,Some of the puzzles in this show are better than Squid game but I a also just as confused as the next person. So is everything a simulation? I enjoyed the first five episodes but then the show drops.,7
East Asia,"Poor acting, poor directing and bad plot story..I feel very strong resident evil vibe in the camera shooting style, animation set, and back song..Everything just..No..",4
East Asia,I'm waiting for next season so i can get more information but so far so good. I feel like a lot of the bad reviews are just because they wanted everything laid there for them since the start and in just 1 season when this tv show is based off a manga which has more plot to give lmao.,10
East Asia,"This Japanese thriller about a group of contestants getting trapped into a games to the death kind of tournament is all the rage these days, so naturally thought I'd check this one out. It plays a lot more like a manga in its realism, mainly in that it does not strive for it. It's weird, most of the characters are superficial, and the premise is just baffling. Like most of these styles of thrillers it begins leaning into the ""community"" / ""relationships"" between the characters for the latter part of the season rather than the ""games"", and in my opinion only declines in quality. It's a show that thinks it's really clever and continually repeats how much it thinks it's clever over and over because it clearly thinks its audience is dumb. They aren't dumb, but this show is. Watch Squid Game instead, is much better.",4
East Asia,"While watching the first part of the season, I longed for watching more of the games and the lore bits killed the speed, the second part the lore comes out really well in my opinion. Don't take this series to seriously, as the realistic properties lack a little.",7
East Asia,"The bad and the good the great dilemma, where every action has a positive or negative reaction in humanity. A series where they have mixed the two sides of the coin in one game.",10
East Asia,"The first few episodes are fine, I enjoyed the game itself but the whole plot in the community was pretty bad.. I don't understand the high ratings. Season 2 is coming for children ??",4
East Asia,I never watched anime or read manga but watching this show made me want more of the genre. The acting and visuals are incredible. The plot does go a little off the rails but its still very fun and emotional show. The characters are great and the character development is also well done.,9
East Asia,"Exciting Japanese Tv-show that gonna send chills through your spine. I discovered this series after I've seen Squid Game, and man, I was not disappointed. Great thrilling game-sequences that will make you hold your breath. Very good, Japan rules! ????",9
East Asia,"Starts well but after the 5th or 6th episode, it offers nothing new to see. I liked the first few games that were better, deadlier, and more intricate than Squid Game. But the series deviates from games and slowly focuses on the 'Beach'. That's where I lost all interest. It doesn't offer much for someone interested in the game itself rather than the environment. Almost all characters are annoying. Production Values are great.In short: This is not bad, it is way overrated.",7
East Asia,"Alice in Borderland has a legitimate plot and is a show on exploitation of human emotions at a progressive rate. The predominant feelings of loss the protagonist Arisu experiences are revisited at various instances throughout the series.The plot builds up a bit slow but eventually takes flight to full battle mode. The fact that the games need more than muscle power to win is appreciable. (This is in fact a loss for Squid-Game). They are filled with riddles and need quick wit and endurance to see them through.I would have loved it if more game sequences were included in the series. The gore level is subtle and the little bit of CGI used isn't that well defined but it hardly affects the series' performance. Another plus, the protagonist isn't shown as the perfect specimen, which makes the viewers connect to Arisu at some level.Psst. For the fellow BL lovers out there:
Keita Machida's performance as Karube is in vast contrast to the Kurosawa san role in the rom-com BL, Cherry Magic! You are greeted by a completely fresh perspective as compared to the calm and mature Kurosawa san.",9
East Asia,"I don't know why isn't this serial as popular as Squid Game. Because it has the same plot and logic of surviving. However, some moments have really illogical acts of actors. For example, when everyone looked for murderer, they just need to watch surveillance cameras and instead of it they really thought a couple of hours who is really murderer.",8
East Asia,"Actually, this serie is extremely good. The designs and sets are completely beautiful. And the plot is so wonderful that captivates you all the time.The only thing that i really dont like, is the fact that some situations end up really quick, like we want more scenes about this.But if you like movies such as battle royale or action movies, you'll love this show! ...............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................",10
East Asia,"This series is much better than squid game, even though the story is a bit different. The acting skills were on point and the last episode was definitely my favorite. You also see throughout the series that each character has a certain talent that they also apply during the games they have to play. I think it's a bit weird with the cards that they have to collect, it's not clear yet what to do with them. But hopefully in season 2 it will become clearer. They say the books are better than the movies, but I personally like the series better than the book itself. Maybe because I'm not really into manga/anime. But for the rest, this series is definitely recommended and if I can give you a tip: WATCH ALICE IN BORDERLAND FIRST AND THEN SQUID GAME!",8
East Asia,"I was always impressed watching Asian films or series. It's fascinating to see how, like most productions not made in & or around Hollywood, they tackle their subjects differently & yet are able to visually & emotionally touch your inner self.The plot is a bit of a mix between Battle Royale & Squid Game plus the characters are generally cardboard cutouts. It is in the way the characters are used that feels refreshing & the twists & turns are genuinely surprising. The action is finely shot & edited, with a raw brutality that reminds the viewer of the desparate situation the characters are in.The end definitely left me wanting more, I'm looking forward to season 2!",10
East Asia,"Season 1: This show certainly keeps you on your toes. It's bold and takes risks. Sometimes it's hard to say whether they paid off or not. For example, killing off all of Arisu's close friends so early in the season after spending quite a bit of time building up their characters definitely had to be a tough decision. The first episodes alongside his friends were very good and then the show almost reinvents itself midway through the season with the introduction of the beach. This isn't to say that the loss of his friends didn't play a significant role still , it certainly did, but it completely changed the dynamic.Arisu and Usagi have a good chemistry throughout and their budding romance is quite believable .I'm not sure the lengthy ending after the beach was burned down was necessary. It sets up season 2 , but takes a long time in doing so all to simply say there will be more games.One thing that's certain is the show has no issue killing off anyone at any point so it is sure to remain interesting.While I really enjoyed this season , it didn't seem to pull me in as much as Squid Game did.Season 2: I loved this season. It took all of the good parts from the first season and elevated them even higher. Sure there are still some slow parts but you really care for the characters more and more over time. Some of the games are so simple and yet so brilliant.Some of the dialogue is absolutely brilliant. The only issue is that I wanted more of Chishiya. In some ways this character is so strong that it overpowers Arisu. The prison cell game is as good as any game in Squid Game, Hunger Games, and season 1.The conclusion is also really well done. I thought it was about to let me down, but came through huge at the end.Hard to say if there will be a season 3, I would guess not, but I will greatly miss this show, taken altogether it was simply awesome.",9
East Asia,"I like the actors in this series. Their names are Kento Yamazaki as Arisu, Keita Machida as Karube, Yuki Morinaga as Shota and Asahina Aya as Kuina. My favourite character is Kuina because she can do martial arts and she can also run fast. She was revaled as transgender in some episode. This series is really good it got really open ending so season 2 can look really good and it can surprise us as watchers of this series. I think that some death was unnecessary because some of them was really good characters in this series. I am very exited for season 2 which is coming in december 22th 2022 and u should watch it!",10
East Asia,"It's so slow, that I barely made it till the idea of the game was revealed, and then it turned out to be the Japanese remake of The Cube with teenage boys. No thanks.Other than that, nicely filmed, the acting seems believable, but the plot is not captivating enough, or should I say anymore, because it has been done before. Main characters who are the players, then you have some expendable characters/players with uninspired and unconvincing dialogue, that obviously have to die in order to explain the rules of the game to the players, much like The Squid Game by the way, cause to the viewer it's already obvious, especially if watched The Cube.",3
East Asia,"I LOVE THIS SHOW, I LOVE THIS SHOW, I LOOOOOOOVE THIS SHOW.I am a huuuuuuge fan of survival shows/shows wherein you have to survive/do a bunch of mindbending/psychological puzzles to survive and THIS SHOW DELIVERED.I mean if you love Battle Royale then you will love this! I was not sure about this, but I am so glad I started watching it, it is amazing!!! I got hooked from the start and I was excited for each episode. The characters are so good, storyline is brilliant, and I enjoyed every episode. I have many questions but am sure we will get our answers in the next season. Cannot wait for S2! I will definitely rewatch it again :D.",10
East Asia,"I wish I could go through the list of reasons people disliked this show and debunk each one, but that would take way too long. One thing I will say is there wasn't much that went into Arisu's moment of overcoming the grief of losing his friends. This being said, we can see his resolve is solidified when he makes contact with three men who vaguely resemble the trio he and his friends used to be. There is also where we get to understand Arisu's newly founded intention while carrying onward. Besides the common hero desire to save the world, he stresses that he's determined not to survive by letting others die. It's as if Arisu is compromising with the new reality he is forced to face.",9
East Asia,"The story's not bad at all. It's kind of a more violent version of Squid Games. I love the apocalyptic/parallel universe aspect. BUT, they are milking some scenes and emotional situations WAY too much. Though I would have still rated it 7 if it wasn't so incredibly misogynistic. The ""strong"" female characters are always somehow reduced to useless degrading moments. For example, Usagi is this strong athletic badass, but somehow can't fight the semi-dying sickly r*pist. I mean come on, how many times did that guy try to r*pe her? The r*pe attempts are just used to objectify her and serve the male gaze. Who still shoots those scenes anyway? Moreover, Arisu is constantly portrayed as her protector although he wouldn't have lasted a day without her. Other women in the show that come up as enemies are also portrayed somewhat weak and less important than their male counterparts.Overall, I would prefer Squid Games. It's not nearly as sexist and also the story doesn't get too distracted by overdramatized lengthy scenes.",4
East Asia,"The first season of Alice in Borderland is one of the most gruesome and exciting pieces of TV show. For me it is better than Squidgame even it has its flaws.I highly expected to see the sequel but after binge watching, it is still entertaining with higher budget for CG, more blockbuster actions, but it the end the story failed flat. It has nothing exciting anymore, the games seem easier than the first season.The ending is alright but along the way it becomes normal action TV show with very high budget. Anyway I recommended only the first season if you don't have much time.First 8/10
Second 6/10.",7
East Asia,"Starting of with the screenplay, it's amazing and fast paced.The most engaging element in this series is it's unique Games and it's rules.Simplest yet deadly, loved the premise, looks high budget movie.Acting of actors are pretty good. Especially Protogonist acting is brilliant. Justified the character pretty well.Character build looks original and interesting.Seen the season 2 finale, must say it ended pretty damn well.Background music is awesome and intensifies when an important scene comes up.Good concept, loved it.The Runtime is justified, not felt boried even for a minute.Netflix has done an amazing job with this Series.",8
East Asia,"I love the manga and read it all
Then when netflix made the series i was afraid they would change it into some political nonsense .. am glad they didnt.Tbh, i like the manga better than the series, however the manga has 60-+ chapters and the series only has 2 seasons. The characters in the series are bit less deep compare to the manga but again, it's acceptable. The ending in manga makes more sense than in the series but i still like it.Again, i cant stress enough that i am glad it respects the source material and not turn it into drag** ball Z disaster.Recommended. Should watch it and also should read the manga. If you live survival theme, u'll love it!",10
East Asia,"I've just finished the second season and feel compelled to write a review. I am absolutely blown away with every aspect of this show. From character development, metaphors and the most jaw dropping plot line. I never saw it coming in a million years!In season 2, it's just FILLED with action, thrill and just the most gripping storyline. I don't think I've seen a series like this that tied everything so perfectly. This is a masterpiece and my hats off to the creators, the actors and producers. What a series.I only ever leave reviews if I feel a show deserves it. I just had to write something. Thank you for giving the world this gift.",10
East Asia,"Games are obviously crazy and over-the-top, wish they showed more diamond games (intellectual, so a lot of suspence). Half-open ending is perfect for either finale or renewal, 'inception'-style. Instead of typical korean economy stuff from squid games, there's a lot of morality discussions driven through flashbacks of characters. Unlike squid games, players have no motive to kill each other, except in-game and everybody are scattered around the city, so there is almost no confrontation. And there are practically no villains among main and recurring characters, i liked it a lot. Still, characters in squid games seemed more interesting. Maybe because they have a lot of screen time in the outside world. In the end squid games in my opinion is better but if you're a fan you definitely should watch AIB too.",8
East Asia,"If the first few episodes of season one are the best ones, than I don't want to know how weak the quality of the other episodes are. I tried the first two and a half episodes of season one but couldn't bring up the will to watch the show any further - there is simply nothing interesting going on that I did not watch already, and better made. The acting is not terrible, but the English dubbing is. I guess the show is more suited to a young audience but if you are beyond your twenties you won't related to any of the characters. The story is also everything but new (as far as I can tell) - a melting of ideas like Cube, Lost and so on but without the suspense, thrill and news. The action is rather generic too. Anyway, production is okay, and I guess if you like to read manga and are heavy into modern Asian movie making you may like this one more than I do. Last word, Squid Games hit me on the right spot and is in my opinion by way superior to Alice in Borderland.",4
East Asia,"I will preface this by saying, I have tried to read the manga several times and could not for the life of me get into it. The show on the other hand is an entirely different thing.Let's start, the beginning is done well it introduce Arisu and his character while also giving subtle hints about chota and Karube and their life before the games. Ep 1-3 continue with great exposition like this, unfortunately the show is drawn out wayyyy too much as you go further on. Some of the dialogues and scenes of back stories are simply not necessary, many of the monologues are not gripping enough to seem realistic and can easily be shortened into something much more meaningful. Not to mention, Arisu's guilt literally plagues him all the way into season 2 it's almost way to obvious. If the writers made his guilt repressed and took his shame in a different way I think his character could've been a bit more complex but he is only becomes useful at the end of each game. It's a whole lot of running around and ""what do we do? What's going on?"" Before arisu's brain actually work, the more I write the more I realize how useless arisu is in this show ??. He has little to no purpose other than being the one who questions everything and somehow manages to figure out how clear games despite all odds. Usagi, however, has a deeper character than him as she develops and transforms after meeting and knowing arisu. Arisu is a foil character for her, she almost seems like the main character.Moving on to after the 3rd ep, 4-8 was way too long and drawn out I wished they wouldn't have even put the beach plot in there. It's completely useless after season 1 and only serves as aguni's character plot and introducing more characters. And of course even the characters introduced there get their back story but not even have make it out so what's even the point? Yes give a villain a back story but even minor villains? The real enemy is the game masters, tell us more about them. I have watched both s1 and s2 and have learned so little about the game masters and what is real and what isn't. At this point I'm back to square 1.Season 1 ended on a decent cliffhanger but s2 didn't really pick it up in a great way. We wanted to learn more about the games and the game masters but none of the kings or queens would say anything about them so what is the point in questioning ANYTHING about them. Arisu literally begs them to give even the smallest hint and the only response is ""you'll see ??"" like bro what? If their reasoning was oh I'll die if I say anything I'd get that but they literally just wouldn't give a straight answer or even a riddle it was nonsense.What I did like though were the action scenes a lot of the characters looked cool as hell, some of the monologues are decent to listen to, and finally some of the villains are actually gripping with their words. For example if u made it as far as the end of s2, I will say I was hooked in the beginning of Mira's monologue to Arisu unfortunately they lost me at the hospital scene which was too long and dumb as hell.Overall fun show for the weekend but not something top-tier :(. Looking forward to season three.",7
East Asia,"I have to agree with the reviewers who said this show is more than a bit sexist - Arisu going on about protecting the obviously far-stronger, braver, more stable and more competent Usagi just makes the show look ridiculous.The thing that really irritated me was Usagi using a crutch on the wrong side just so she can be shown leaning on Arisu at the end. Presumably her rehabilitation doctor will have taught her that she should be using the crutch on her weak side, so she had no need to turn Arisu into a giant stick as she left the hospital. Perhaps we should just interpret that as Usagi helping Arisu to feel like he's remotely useful, as she really doesn't need him for anything.I was very disappointed by the directorial choices for the gratuitous r*pe scene too. The guy is coughing up blood! Given what we have seen her do thus far, she could have floored him in ten seconds.Having not read the comics, the show did keep me guessing as to what was going on. (And given the last scene, maybe still guessing... which is good because the S2 ending is rather under-explained as things stand.) I was hooked on some of the games, and I liked the supporting characters. But they should have wasted less time building suspense through Arisu's frustrating levels of inaction and more time building up the back stories for the wider cast. It feels like motivations are just surgically injected with a flashback needle whenever required, and some of the second season antagonists especially could have done with a bit more setup. (Also the supporting characters - what was the payoff for Ann's hike to Yokohama and back, for example?)It's not the artistic achievement that Squid Game was but it's still worth watching for all the good bits - just don't let yourself think too much about all the irritations!",7
East Asia,"This is not squid games and I don't see the point of comparison just to criticize one show at some aspect that it did better than the other. Both shows are phenomenal.Happy to see season 2 turned out to be so great, because in some series with sequel seasons the quality drops, this is not the case here. My favorite games were Jack of hearts and queen of hearts, it was so unexpected.I was happy to see this development of main characters, questions about the virtues, ideals and freedom that they showed. There really aren't that many shows as interesting as this one, I recommend it to everyone.",10
East Asia,"Gurl........what happened to season 2 man......Story telling is so lousy in season 2. For me personally, season 1 is 8 points season 2 is only 2 points. I really tried hard to stay focused for first 3 episodes. If u don't care about story line, and just to see ppl mind games then i think it is fine. It gets better in later episodes. However in overall,
S2 doest have much creative games or why they have to play games at first place. Its just Story telling is so disconnected. Also, Cant relate to characters. So much talking. Disappointing. I am not sure there will be season 3, but if there will be , hope they make something more relatable. Perhaps i had too much expectation which led to huge disappointment.",4
East Asia,It's an interesting idea for a show.Unfortunately the depth of character development is very shallow leaving you uncaring about characters succeeding or failing. This leaves you uncommitted to the plot as you don't really care who lives or who dies. The plot also seems to be very shallow and meandering leaving you confused as to the direction that the program may take. The English dubbing is very very poor and obviously cheap. They could have spent some more money getting better actors to provide the voices. Comparing the show to the squid games is very obvious as they are both coming from the same type of genre. However this show fails to capitalise on the excitement the squid games left viewers wanting more of.,6
East Asia,"I'm usually a really harsh critic of movies and series in general but this show has absolutely blown me away. This is probably one of the best story writing skills I've seen in a tv series. I loved how unpredictable the show has been since the start. Despite not making a lot of sense in terms of where they were and why everything was happening, the show was extremely addictive to watch. I really enjoyed how they addressed all the potential theories viewers had in season 2. The character development was also noteworthy! Their backstories and how they all relate to one another is also exposed eventually. The best aspect of the show for me was that it has alot more depth to it then you would expect. Truly this show is a work of art for the people who like to read in between the lines and appreciate deeper meaning.",10
East Asia,"Binge watched season 2.Based on manga graphic novel,
This survival thriller drama has returned
with decent season 2 after 2 years.S2 picks up where S1 left off.Arisu and the gang continue to survive
in a dystopian world consisting
of death games and betrayal, and advances to next level of game.I really enjoyed this season more.It has Cleverly created thrilling games,
good character development,
quick transitions into flashback / back stories of character and present situation,
Good pacing except for last episode,
Easy cliffhangers, convenient plot development,
Good choreographed action n combat scenes
(specially in epi 7),
Decent performances,
Good editing, VFX n visuals.But it took too much time to reach the Climax.I'm happy with the ending.They kept one window open for next season.Over all, I enjoyed it.Total binge-worthy.",8
East Asia,"Watched the first season and enjoyed it.Season 2 has a good start and a few interesting games as good as the first season.Haven't watched Anime one yet but worth watching it as well,I guess. Disappointing ending and climax is getting a little bit boring.Good flashbacks of each character's real life.Could make ending is more realistic then confuse viewers better. Virtual world will happen one day and make us think more what would be like your life. I expected to be a different ending and more interesting story.But still enjoyable to watch some mind games they went through, pretty clever making those games.",7
East Asia,"I love this show but I still don't know what's exactly going on. If this show cancels, I will be really disappointed. I believe everything was perfect. The plot, the cast and the cinematography. The games were intense, I had agony in each of them. The cast was likeable. Even the villains had an interest because some were strong and some mysterious. We need a season 3! I love this show but I still don't know what's exactly going on. If this show cancels, I will be really disappointed. I believe everything was perfect. The plot, the cast and the cinematography. The games were intense, I had agony in each of them. The cast was likeable. Even the villains had an interest because some were strong and some mysterious. We need a season 3!",10
East Asia,It has so many suspenses and twists will keep you wanting more! Have been waiting for this show for a year and now it has turned up the heat! Japanese manga are a work of art! Forget squid game this is how the real games should be!! Excellent and specially the action scenes are a work of art!I loved season one but season 2 follows the same way it left and does not disappoint... love the acting the screenplay and directing.. everything falls perfectly for the viewers to engage and enjoy.. the roles fit perfectly and the games are truly enjoyable and would have never expected it to turn out the way it did.. Enjoy!,10
East Asia,"Characters are shallow, acting is poor, actors are crying non stop over petty things and for long time, and worst of all, every single piece of action is just not realistic at all. I understand this is fiction, but come on, at least try to make it more relatable. Fighting scenes are too long and unremarkable. Bad guys are slow, clumsy, stupid and without energy. Good guys are the luckiest ever, surfing between the bullets and when injured are able to chill and heal on the streets faster than in a hospital. This would be a nice comedy if characters were not crybabies.As others already pointed out, this tv show is probably for younger, or at least more impressionable, audience.",2
East Asia,"For me is fare and square the best show out there for this type of life or death games.Good characters, nice story and the games... Oh my god the games....It's the story about 3 friends you are transferred to another world, where they have to play to survive.S2 picks up where the first one ends, with the same intensity and more twisted challenges.The only thing I'm going to spoil it's look for the hearts games, the ones about deception, they are truly a work of a genius.Based on a Manga, it is for me the best of his genre by far.The first episodes are slow but please give at a chance, it's a gem in hidden and needs more recognition.",10
East Asia,"Omg I really REALLY tried to enjoy it. Looking for silver linings. The premise is fun, kind of cliché but fun. Really poor acting, I don't know if every Japanese TV shows are like this? I don't think so. I waited for something kind of theatrical, but not cringy. Also, it is full of plot holes. Why the main characters who is kind of a genius at the first episode, after many episodes he doesn't show the same skills? Like he forgot everything he knew. The behavior of the characters, or development is not consistent. They make decisions that nobody would in the real world (maybe they are not addressing realism, but still it kind of loses points of fun cause it's not relatable to).It just doesn't make any sense. "" let's play this game that we know nothing about of without discussing what to do, let's everyone do whatever you think is best OK? A plan? Who needs a plan?""And the direction. Pleeeease director stop with the dramatic pauses for dramatic purposes which make no effect at all!!! That resource turns the scenes longer and more boring...",4
East Asia,"Many answers you were looking for in Season 1, you'll find in season 2. A binge-worthy tv series. Both seasons have 8 episodes each making it possible to binge watch in a few days time. It's a thrill filled Japanese tvseries where people die if they lose a game. It has it's emotional moments and slowly you'll start liking some of the characters and want them to survive.P. S: I personally feel like while squid game was good, this tv series is on a while another new level. Just ignore the negative reviews and give it a try. Must watch tv series. If the starting feels like a bit slow, bear with it...the fruits that lie await will be worth it !",10
East Asia,"But, there are pretty good characters, an interesting idea. I am not talking about how well it was executed, good enough to watch and enjoy. The most annoying character is Arisu. The guy is that so ashamed to look at women, he is a weak and idiotic character that somehow is always on top. His dramatic crying and always trying to be a hero in situation where he just gotta fight for his life and kill someone who doesn't deserve to be in the world, but he always finds an excuse not to do it, is just annoying as hell. He is an emotional baby that can't accept the new way of living. Every time he cries or do his stupid face reaction like he is struggling, damn it's disgusting. Almost every other character have some reason to fight either on a good or evil side, but Arisu he's just pointless, clueless and totally dumb character. Too many repeatable situations and reactions, it doesn't feel that the character grows, he remains the same person regardless of all consequences and experiences he gets. This is totally out of concept of a role playing games that this tv show tries to represent. I would love to see his character to get mature and less emotional, especially of what he got through.",5
East Asia,"Season 2 has a very good transition to the previous season. It's not always full of action - which annoys some others - there are also quiet moments to enjoy before the next game of life or death moves on.Compared to a film, there isn't the classic curve that keeps building up, but there are always flattenings, which in my opinion, makes the whole thing even more intense.Season 2 is even more fun to put myself in the scenario of how I would make decisions but also to think out of the box and think about what would be the decisions of the others.I'm not someone who switches off and lets pure violence affect me. I want to think and reflect and season 2 did it even better than season 1.Of course, some action scenes are exaggerated, but you know that from every film/series.The connection to the characters is well done and even if you don't see yourself in the protagonists, it's interesting to know that there is always someone who feels like they have a mirror in front of them.The actors - as well as voice actors - are well chosen.",9
East Asia,"Deserves the hype that Squid Game later received. Unorthodox and unprepareable, often cruel, situations brought on by some god's sick sense of humour contrast with the good and bad of humanity which bring this series to life. Recommended.Synopsis:
An aimless gamer and his two friends find themselves in a parallel Tokyo, where they're forced to compete in a series of sadistic games to survive. It covers the Borderland Games' first phase with the arrival of the players and the completion of the Spot Card Games.An aimless gamer and his two friends find themselves in a parallel Tokyo, where they're forced to compete in a series of sadistic games to survive. It covers the Borderland Games' first phase with the arrival of the players and the completion of the Spot Card Games.",8
East Asia,"This must be the best netflix series I've watched to date. Again, people know that this is better than Squid Game. People who are giving this lower review don't know quality series. Each episodes are tense, action and acting are superb. This show really deserves a Season 3.There are lot of lessons you will learn. There are lot of scenes that will move you. There are lot of games you will enjoy to watch. There are lot of characters you will love from start til the end.How sad this doesn't get the awards it deserves?Anyway, lot of 6 or 7 star-rating are sometimes way better than the 8 or 9 overrated series right. That explains it. These days, anything can be manipulated. Awards, reviews and almost everything. Let's just judge it on our own taste and be happy on what we are watching.For me, this show is 10/10!",10
East Asia,"Oh dear lord, I see people saying it goes downhill from episode 4 onwards, but I haven't even made it there. So much unnecessary filler scenes and cliche dramatization. None of the wit, outsmarting opponents, or breaking the game that I would expect from the genre. This is just gore.Some say the games are interesting. I don't see what's so interesting about hide and seek, where everyone besides the catcher dies. Of course, the main character happens to be the catcher, and some lame drama happens. Just seems like a pretty convenient way to kill off everyone except the main character. Not sure what's so interesting about tag with machine guns either.So disappointing.",1
East Asia,"A manga or comic book adapted live action series. 2 seasons of 50 minutes to 1+hr series. Falls in action, adventure, horror, thriller, fantasy, scifi and family categories. Despite the family category, its not much of a family friendly series as it full with horrofic scenes for adults. Its about several groups of people stuck in limbo (a world between life and death), surviving every day in that world by participating in a death match to extend their stay until beating the leaders so that they can escape to the real world without knowing the reasons behind all the misery & losses.Season 1 was okay for me and not much of a fan since the storyline was not fully followed the manga/comic book. Meanwhile, season 2 was the best as it was faithful to the comic till the end. Although i felt it was rushed but the graphics and acting skills of the casts were tremendously improved since the previous season. Great audio and action scenes. New amazing line of casts and huge improvements on the previous main casts. Some parts were tearjerking, some games were exciting to be watched on bigger screen. Exceed my expectations, hence its one of my favorite show of the year 2022. Highly recommended.",8
East Asia,The series is absolutely good but are really more violence scene but it's really enjoyable. The acting was perfect. The screenplay is amazing.you should definitely give a try.Have a good day:),9
East Asia,"If you're a fan of zombie show and won't care about the quality/plot or any details - sure go for it.Also if you're new to Korean shows and want to watch something go ahead
However, if you're someone who watches shows for the plot, direction, cinematography, stunts then I'd say this one was so disappointing.It looked great when the trailer was out. I was actually excited but the show is below average for me. The camera work was sloppy. Looks like it was shot way back in 2000 or the techniques they used were quite outdated not sure about that (still there were good shows with good quality before 2000s. So clearing that )
Background score is really not appropriate - it doesn't sync with most of the scenes. Usually Koreans shows have amazing OST's or background scores.The plot is terrible - Same typical plot (both school/zombie) there's nothing new plus they tried to fit everything in the plot that it felt more of a school drama than zombie school drama
This may be a low budget show but still I've seen better shows with low budget!Anyway all I want to say is rather than watching this show and wasting time on it. Please watch Happiness (its of same genre but the plot is amazing - overall an epic show ) and thank me later ??
This is coming from a person who watched countless number of Korean shows and is tired of basic plots - so don't be offended if you liked the show. Since, most of the reviews are misleading to someone like me I just wanted to put it out there.",5
East Asia,There are many zombie movies already for us. But it is simply superb....??wonderful acting.. not a slow start at all....must give a try for to this fabulous series... And it gonna be a best series like sucide squad....,10
East Asia,"Nobody does Zombie like the Koreans. The moves, the story, the acting all top notch.Train to Busan is one of my favourite zombie films of all time and this series is going to be one of my favourites too10/10.",10
East Asia,"Just finished watching the first episode (the series got released today). Started out with interesting character development and story building. One thing I like, and perhaps what may make this series different from other zombie series/movies, is that it tries to establish the similarities between domination of certain sections of people over the others in our society and dominant / invasive nature of parasites/viruses over other living organisms, irrespective of intelligence, consciousness or any other things.Will have to see how the rest of the series turns out to be. Hope it turns out to be another critically acclaimed Korean series, among so many others.",9
East Asia,This movie is really good i like zombie movies only few seasons are good this season one of tham all actor all story are very good and also very decent production.,10
East Asia,"What was that?? I'm completely amazed, bruh.Ignore the bad reviews already. Just watch it for ur own fun.It's Gory, and I loved it. Watched the first 5 episode. And it's a good run.This is a good series in the zombie franchise.Must watch.Gumawo.",10
East Asia,"This serie is clearly an adaptation of Highschool of the dead Manga series which sadly stopped. After the first couple of episodes I like it a lot, the acting is very good. Zombies are superb as you might expect from Korean Zombie genre.",8
East Asia,So far it's been a generic plot. Nothing happening other than people turning into zombies.5/10 coz I haven't watched it in entirety.Waste of time tbh.,4
East Asia,They overrated the drama the series was just crying and surviving i guess this is korean drama it's not interesting or the story so ridiculous kids can make better zombie series better than this.,6
East Asia,"After watching so many zombie movies and series, this one doesnt have anything new and exciting to offer. The characters have no depth and the scenes are predictable and not believable. All of the episodes are just endless acrobats and running around. It such a shame because some of the actors are actually good.",6
East Asia,"Too excited for this show and maybe that was why I was disappointed. Non stop watched to ep. 3 trying to get into the storyline and characters, and although it gets better after each episodes, both storyline and characters so far are unremarkable. Too many holes in the plot, timeline all wrong.. Some of the main characters are so annoying that I rooted for the zombies.Nevertheless, the zombies are great and it is definitely entertaining so I would grudgingly finish watching this.",6
East Asia,"The story is very generic, predictable and monotonous. There isn't much going on except for a few scenes of violence. The zombies are okay, the humans are as dumb as you can expect them to be in a zombie movie, I would say even dumber than most movies. They fight among themselves, they have a tendency to exhibit wisdom after the event. Their actions don't make any sense at all. All in all, this is a very long and tedious watch. Don't waste your time like I did.",4
East Asia,Koreans really know how to make a zombie flick!Great character building and introduction of the different plotlines.Two episodes in and it's mayhen and chaos all over the school!As you go on more characters and different situations are presented and it all unfolds perfectly.It is really well paced and non-stop action. A dramatic scene here and there but not too much to get you bored.Freaky zombie outbreak like I've never seen before (only in Train to Busan).I can't wait to see how it all plays out.,8
East Asia,"They were so calm when there is a zombie outbreak happening and some of them aren't even showing fear.. I thought at first that maybe their mind just went blank because of what was happening, but as it goes on they're still showing blank expressions. It's really disappointing to be honest.",2
East Asia,"I was hoping like everyone if the series is of same universe as of train to busan but it isn't, this series is so dumb and cringe and just like anyother horror or zombie movie, characters instead of running away from fear runs towards it, everything looks so annoying that I couldn't watch it,just horrible.",2
East Asia,"I've read webtoon ""All of us are dead (Now at our school)"" right after watching the trailer of this show. It wasn't a lengthy comic with a heavy conversation, so it was easy to turn to the next chapters. I'm not a fan of the style of the comic, but it was still fun and intense. I'm in the 5th episode right now, and so far I've felt the show adapted the original webtoon quiet well which is why I wanted to write a review about it. However, I get to see these assumptions of promoting High school of the dead from the comments which is not okay seriously. I also watched High school of the Dead long time ago. All I can remember is that the anime was more about female body images rather than zombies and stuff. Plots and characters in both shows, there's no any similarity between the two. The only similar aspect is they both use high school students as main characters. Honestly, Is there anime that doesn't use high school students as main characters? Seriously, google High school of the dead anime, and watch it on youtube, you'll get the idea within 2 minutes. I would not recommend to watch it with female companions or friends though. Back to the show, All of us are dead, it's well made, and it adopted the original story very well.Update: I ended up watching the whole series for 2 days. It's worth it just as other positive reviewers say. It's well paced, and mixed with good actions. Also it created a different type of zombie.",8
East Asia,"Central to the plot is a horrific theme of constant and brutal bullying, which is not only disturbing, miserable and frustrating to watch, but is the least creative subplot conceivable for a high school drama. I can't imagine how anyone could muscle through a viewing of the whole season, but I intend to spare myself the pain of a second episode.",1
East Asia,"It's the first time I am going to write a review without finishing a season of a series but this deserves it! If you are a zombie fan then stop reading and start watching! It is amazing it has everything you want - lots of action, gore, likable characters and hundreds of zombies..I don't want this season to finish! Well done Netflix bring more series like this!",9
East Asia,"If you're looking for some 'Train to Busan' kind of horror or action, then walk away because the movie isn't for you.Not every zombie movie or show has to have the same storyline; it can either be funny like ""Zombieland,"" serious like ''World War Z' or be in the form of a TV series like ""The Walking Dead.""It depends on your preferences. Speaking of ""All of Us are Dead,"" it's a decent watch if you're into survival genre and you have nothing else to watch at the moment.In addition to that,
1. It's based on a popular webtoon
2. The effects are good
3. It's only 12 episodes, unlike some TV series with 16 plus.",7
East Asia,"Absolutely amazing. One of the best Korean drama. It hits much harder when you come to the realization that a pandemic is already going on and we are helpless. This drama gives hope and tells what friendship means and how far one can go to take revenge. It's a complete mix of thrill, horror, drama and cute romance.",10
East Asia,"Happiness (2021) is also a Zombie Kdrama, except it's not. It focuses on the human aspect of survival in a way to try and present itself as unique. It tries to show us that humans are worse than zombies, except the writing is absolute garbage because the basis of each episode is a character making a dumb decision and then the two main protagonists having to fix that dumb decision. That is not how you create plot! That show falls into every zombie pitfall trope possible.Now All os Us are dead on the other hand is amazing. If you want to see how cruel humans can actually be to one another, this is the show, especially after episode 3. Good cast of characters, great action, great plot, great sfx makeup and average cinematography. However if you're watching this show for film making techniques you've come to the wrong place.",9
East Asia,"It was all a hype. I first saw the webtoon but i didnt bother to read it so when i learned that they will make it a series, i was excited. Welll the story isnt interesting at all. ?? u watch these students make annoying dialogues and most of the scenes are dead or okay to be removed since they do not mean anything to the plot. I skipped a lot of dialogues because it is truly a waste of time. To be fair, the first few episodes are good but the rest is literally to make it long. Imo, they shouldve just made it into a movie.",3
East Asia,Some of the characters were a little annoying and the romantic interests felt just a bit silly and somewhat ill fitting given it's an apocalyptic scenario. I felt it was aimed at a predominantly teen audience and that it was really quite laboured with not a great deal happening given that it was over 11 hours of TV. It could easily have been done in 8 episodes. Those criticisms aside it was otherwise reasonably entertaining.,7
East Asia,I only watched 2 episode right now ...guys its awsome its not serious like TWD.but its not funny as ZOMBOAT...trust me you will like it even you are not ZOMBIE fan .....,10
East Asia,"This series is really amazing wait for 2nd season. This is one of the greatest series in netflix and also korea .I am really surprised and So many congratulations all of cast and all of us Dead,s members.",10
East Asia,"Over 12 hours for a zombie story!!!!! God it gets boring and repetitive after initial 2-3 episodes. After that it is just counting how different people becomes zombie and keep counting bodies. Too many subplots and hell lot of characters, unnecessary drag.",1
East Asia,Actors who portrayed Cheong San and Nam Ri as well as the adults were able to deliver but some were totally lacking especially the one who played On Jo.Storyline is meh. Tried to tackle a bit too much that audience would not feel much empathy towards the characters.Good zombies make up though.,4
East Asia,"? Easy plot but the storyline compensates it as a whole
? Gore effects
? Lead roles (males) and the class president's acting
? Properly executed but its very predictable twists and cliché
? Mind blowing scientific explanation on how it (zombies) started? Character build up
? Slow start
? Some loopholes like people are aware that they are zombies but they don't know how to kill them and etcetera
? Female lead roles' action skills
? Ending can be a lot better (I think); a different cliff hanger, maybe. Why would they go back to the same place where they barely survived even if its for a good purpose???? Because of plot armor
It could've been 8, however, I find some unnecessary conversations which doesn't add up to the storyline. Its just there to make the episode longer. ??Add ons:I know this is a fiction however the reason why I don't like the ending is because, in a fiction called Hunger Games: Catching Fire, no one would like to play the games for the 3rd quarter quell because it can mean death, again.Train to Busan and Kingdom is very, very good that's why it somehow shattered my expectations specially from the trailer.I can't also help but to compare it to Highschool of the Dead, it is shorter but a lot of things happened (I can let this go because I have to consider the pandemic which limits resources and locations.)",7
East Asia,"Upon seeing reviews, I've watched it. There's no interesting content. It has the same old zombie plot. Train to busan was a lot better compared to this.",1
East Asia,I do love watching anything Korean and zombies thrown into the mix was a bonus I really enjoyed it was was glued to the TV all day. Ignore the negative comments and give it a try and then decide for yourself. ????,10
East Asia,"They just scape of the dead using doors and windows against the zombies..., everyone is screaming and eating each other alive..., they are covered in blood....And the only thing that they do is to talk about date each other.Yes I lost 2h of my life watching and they will not came back.",1
East Asia,"The shows bring nothing new compared to other zombies tv shows/movies. I'm 4 episodes into it and it's really slow, the characters are so cliches and the whole thing is boring.",6
East Asia,"Such a cliché plot and unlikable characters. The series doesnt offer anything new. If you have watched any other x zombie movie this one is exactly the same no taste weak plot, weal characters.",1
East Asia,"Started pretty well, but that posh b@#*# in the pink top just ruined the whole show for me...Too bad as it seemed to be unique even if it is a zombie movie.",7
East Asia,I love zombie flicks! From low budget to no budget to good budget productions. And I couldn't wait after seeing the 'This will blow you away' postings on social media. I decided to set aside the evening and binge watch it. But it was just disappointing. Are people so starved for anything zombie related these days that mediocre passes for mind blowing? I'm not sure. But I only made it a few episodes in before tuning out.,4
East Asia,"They set up the story with played out tropes without any original take on them (bullies and high-teen drama), and social commentary aspect takes over the believability of the story.",2
East Asia,"Yes -- I see you.This series was awesome.One of the better zombie movies for sure. It's not one of those blunt zombie movies where people get eaten alive. The movie touches upon real societal issues, youth violence & crime, and class division. There are only handful of zombie outbreak movies out there that can even compare.Ugh so much blind hate.",10
East Asia,"All of us are dead is extremely graphic and disturbing than you may expect. Squeamish people... don't even try. People who want an edge-of-the-seat entertainment and can handle lavish gore... you guys are in for a ride.Each episode delivers and even though they're a bit longer than usual, they don't feel tedious. When there's no mayhem, there are the character conflicts, thus making every episode as gripping as possible.The characters are horror flick typical but they're smart and resourceful- okay maybe some foolish decisions here and there but hey they're still high school students! Seeing them come up with clever escape gimmicks is always the most fun part, as well as seeing them build trust between each other.Cinematography is fine with some striking and ominous frame shots. Sound effects are impressive and detailed (with lots and lots of squelching lol). And the zombie transformation scenes - no matter how repetitive they get - always look pretty insane!The cast are fantastic and everyone shines. I love that they're actually young actors cast as high schoolers (Hollywood take some notes!).Overall, All of us are dead succeeds at being grim, comedic, and emotional all at the same time. Definitely a neat addition to the zombie/survival genre. Looks like another Netflix hit from South Korea.8/10 worth the 12 hours.TW: Bullying / Sexual harassment / Suicide.",8
East Asia,Mind blowing series.this series blow my mind to their beauty their story their characters and their connection to my heart. Must watch this series.Who watched squid game definitely you should watch this series you will love it . I'll again watch this series.And also i want to tell you i finished this series in 12 hour non stop.,10
East Asia,"It's thrilling and fun. In particular, after Kyung-soo turned into a zombie, he was able to immerse himself in the drama. My time melted gently. I was deprived of time. I'm sure you feel the same way.",10
East Asia,"Only 4 episodes in, its very dramatic but fun moments and zombie attacks everywhere, gonna keep continue watching this, any zombie lover and korean series watchers would love this one.",9
East Asia,"It's not a terrible show . But seriously , how can they make these characters so idiotic . The girl that killed the classmate with the cloth was one of the worst characters I've ever seen in a show. I nearly had to stop watching after her first few scenes. Then we get to the character on the roof that can hear them talking on the other side of the door then tells the Blackhawk soldiers with guns that there's no one left ? Like seriously , even in a life and death situation , no one would ever do something like that . It's absolutely ridiculous. The people at rotten tomatoes giving this show 100% must not have brains, cuz it would be impossible to give this show a 10/10.",4
East Asia,"I'm a huge fan of the zombies genre and this is was just horrible. It had so much potential, it could've been another Battle Royale theme but with zombies. I guess we got spoiled with Kingdom and Train to Busan. As mentioned in the other reviews, the dialogue drags and it doesn't go anywhere. The kids were so annoying I was literally hoping they would all die so the series would end. The worse is when they all just stand there while watching their friends get killed or watching one of them fight off a slew of zombies. Poorly developed storylines and characters. I can't believe there are 12 episodes to this disappointing mess. I stopped in the middle of 5 and I should've cut my losses after 2.",3
East Asia,Amazing series worth to watch its an interesting series with lot of emotions and fun i really enjoyed it. Forget about bad reviews just go for it.the actors acting is also really good i hope they will make season two of this.i know that koreans never disappoint us while making these type of contents.the visual effects are also really good......,10
East Asia,"Maybe because i've seen kingdom and sweet home, i was expecting something more. There are unnecessary scenes that contribute nothing to the plot. Added sexuaI violence scene of a minor that wasn't in the original webtoon, filmed in a way that was no different from p*rnography.",1
East Asia,"This series just feels so real, and everything happened in it can be convincingly happening in real life, this is what most zombie series are lack of. And another thing this series is good at is the action scenes, they really did a great job.All characters in this drama is depicted well, with their distinct personalities, even those characters that only appeared once or twice. The main characters also got distinct personalities and each of the acted very well, that's what we need for a zombie drama, because a zombie drama without deep character development can be pure brainless entertainment with lot's of gore and violence only.There're also shortcomings in this series, especially in mid sections of this drama, everything gets a little boring, however, the plot is getting more and more attractive as the plot goes on, and it can still hook audiences without much action scenes involved.Overall, this series is a great zombie series with great action scenes, and a decent plot with deep character development, it's a zombie series with good production value.",10
East Asia,"What was that?? I'm completely amazed, bruh.Ignore the bad reviews already. Just watch it for ur own fun.It's Gory, and I loved it. Watched the first 5 episode. And it's a good.",10
East Asia,"This is a decent zombie flick. High school students tried to survive a zombie outbreak at their school. Of course, it would not be a young adult flick without love stories, friendship stories, bromance and .... bullying. You would expect that, wouldn't you?!One thing I would like to add for future zombie script writers. Zombie movies have been around since 1978, so the terms zombie outbreak and its symptoms are not an unknown thing to people nowadays. But every zombie movies always begin with an outbreak that looks like nobody know what it is or what to do. Please, next time write a zombie flick which the protagonists are aware of it and know what to do about it. It would be a refreshing story.Worth watching 8/10.",8
East Asia,Very well-paced! It was interesting to see zombies all over the school. I couldn't keep my eyes off as the story unfolded.It was so much fun! Trust me.. you will love this series.,10
East Asia,AOUAD is great zombie survival show though it borrows many elements from other manga's (like sweet home) and train to busan but it is really original. Forget high school of the dead thats pure echhi. But this is really thrilling survival horror show. Cinematography and direction is good. Zombies are scaries. Show isn't predictable and ending is not that good. Cliffhangers are bad but action makes it all for it. If you liked this i recommend read SWEET HOME webtoon. A must watch for people coming in zombie genre.,8
East Asia,"The friendship and their loyalty was the best thing that the show represents. When it comes to movie between life and death and you want the actors to make the best decision instead of irritating and selfish ones well this is it.Ive never been so satisfied with the characters and their decisions. Their loyalty, love, perseverance and tolerance. Each character brings so much presence in their own right.On the plus side. Park Solomon is easy on the eyes. And so are the rest. But he shines like never before.",9
East Asia,It has everything zombies friendships romance bombing a total city as last resort all in one a fun watch don't miss it. Its around 11 hours long so watch it in 2 days !,9
East Asia,"3 episodes in, I have to say I'm enjoying it.Yes it's not perfect at all;whenever someone is transforming in a zombie, people just stare and stay still. While there's enough time to take action like throw him/her out of a window or bash its skull. Rather than doing that they just watch and start running when the zombie has fully transformed. I could understand that the first time. But after the same person has seen more than 10 zombie 'transformations', and still does not take action and is surprised the zombie then launches at them, you start to wonder how stupid they actually are...CGI doesn't look to good when there is action involved like a zombie launching itself at someone.Saying that, I have to admit really enjoying this show. It's well acted, well written, sometimes even original and overall it's just tons of fun.A solid 7 for me.",7
East Asia,"I don't know what to say I'm speechless but this is a very amazing show love it. I love every part of it,I love the entire episodes so cool..??
Hope in season 2 would be very scary! I'm excited.Great show???? keep it up.",10
East Asia,"The character is not special enough to like.-For me, the atmosphere in the movie is not attractive, maybe the length is too long.-There are a lot of scenes that are a bit awkward.-There are a lot of boring dialogues.Old content but not more advanced.-Quite long for entertainment.*Other than that, the action scenes are fine.",3
East Asia,"I finished watching this before giving this review. But tbh......This is a very disappointing zombie movie. I just waste my time, I should stop watching this after 3episodes.Tho the zombie's makeup/effects are nice.",3
East Asia,But ...I have complained that why in every zombie series/movie main character is die at end and it is very emotional moment......................................................,10
East Asia,A Korean high school is the epicentre for a virus which turns the students into flesh eating zombies. The story centres around a small group of students and their attempt to survive as they are continually hunted. It is well acted and it tells the stories of the good and bad pupils which the zombies do not differentiate from when they mindlessly attack. It has plenty of individual introspection as friends and family fall victim and although not the best storyline each episode does enough to hold your interest for the whole series to discover the outcome.,7
East Asia,This was the best zombie webseries i watched untile now and i expect more. Like this .zombie scene in high school was awsome. I was imagening what would i do if was in their position.,9
East Asia,"They are staring zombies. I got bored from the long stares. They are zombies!! What are you looking? Just run! Not good enough, i am disappointed. Why 7.8? Interesting rating!",3
East Asia,I actually find it quite slow and boring. I am on episode 4 now but going to skip a few. Maybe something will happen instead of every episode the same.,3
East Asia,"I watched it in a single go.Its gory and fun to watch with amazing plot point.I loved how Lee Byeong Chan created the virus in order to save his son, but failed in creating a vaccine, and how it all started with a simple lab rat.",9
East Asia,"All of Us Are Dead is South Korea's latest entry into its esscalating body of undead mayhem (Train to Busan, #Alive, Happiness).All of Us Are Dead pulls no punches and unleashes a savage and seemingly never-ending assault of fast-running zombies on an unfortunate squad of students who've managed to survive the first wave of a zombiecalypse. With 12 episodes running 1 hr long each, it gets a bit exhausting at times due to continuous gore and violence, yet it sticks to the basics and delivers a positive outcome, although there's nothing new.All of Us Are Dead's zombie action is never not impressive. Whether it's giant chaotic crowd shots, massive ensemble brawls, or tricky ""oners,"" this is massively kinetic storytelling that will drain you as emotionally as it drains our heroes physically. Likewise, there are dozens of instances involving astounding body acting.All of Us Are Dead may not offer up anything exactly new in the realm of zombie carnage other than its somewhat cruel and unrelenting nature, but sometimes that's enough to pull off some damn effective survival horror.My Rating : 7.5/10.",7
East Asia,"If you want to slap your forehead every five minutes, this series helps you maintain the rhythm. I'm used to characters in horror movies and series making idiotic decisions, I really am, but this takes it to a whole new level. If this series tried to mock the stupidity of most horror flicks, it would be a fun little series, but unfortunately it tries to be serious. What a waste of time and brain cells. I don't understand the high ratings, but to each their own I guess.",3
East Asia,Looking forward for season 2. The story goes on fast not boring at all. I enjoy it despite some part that bugged me. Some Character's actions are little bit annoying ie. Screaming so loud and keep standing/staring while zombies are coming. And the bad guy got zombie blood in his mouth since beginning(in school canteen) why hes not a zombie?,7
East Asia,"I always loved watching korean zombie movies and very hopeful while watching this trailer. But I'm so disappointed with this series! I think this is the worse korean zombie I have ever seen. From storyline to the action and movement of the zombie.Don't waste your time watching this series, or if you want to watch it try one or two episodes and you'll know.",3
East Asia,"If you enjoy watching Zombie stories ,definetly worth to see this show,i really enjoyed,great acting also funny moments,i do recommend it ,korean people ,you know how to do zombie stories and the best make up !",7
East Asia,This thing is actually pretty slow and boring until episode 3 then the pace really picks up and things start to get interesting. So if you are looking for quick action then skip to episode 3 or the middle of episode 2. I'm now at episode 6 and it's actually pretty interesting now.,8
East Asia,I think most bad reviews are from those new Korean drama watchers after squid game. Korean drama and films are always known to have a slow character build up. As it's essential to get to know a character. Having said that yes it's annoying at times with these kiddish behaviour however these are teenagers after all. Regardless I would watch Korean zombies any day. Great show and great entertainment ??,9
East Asia,"It is a film that has found value enough to want to write a review despite having to use a translator.Like a Korean drama, the sophisticated film technique and detail stood out.What makes this film more valuable is that it tries to deal with the problems of human society.It shows the gap between the rich and the poor among students in the school, bullying among students, and the selfishness of human beings through it.In a situation where zombies spread throughout the city, the attitudes of each person involved also show the brutality and dignity of human beings at the same time.I feel that this drama asks us a lot of philosophical questions and I want to give it a big score.Through nonstop action, the eyes are not boring, the romance between students is well expressed, and the friendship between people move us.I don't give it a full score because of the boring parts in between, but I recommend this drama.",9
East Asia,"Imo I thought the first episode was a bit slow to get to the zombie outbreak and boy was I happy when it did.I find how the virus was made a little interesting, nothing mind blowing, but interesting. I think the only thing that gets me are the points where the writing is dumbed down so the plot can move forward. The best moment I can think of is when a kid calls the authorities. I sat there and repeated ""please don't be stupid and say ""zombies are attacking students at my school""."" and then the student brings up Train to Busan, which you should watch if you haven't yet. So far this is a good zombie series.Some points off for writing and pacing but still good.",8
East Asia,"I like the start of this show very much, it got me very hooked that I finished the first 7 episodes in one go and some of those plots are convincing and heartbreaking at the same time. While not all of the protagonists' actions are sensible and enjoyable to watch, they are somewhat reasonable and if anyone got pushed to a corner, it could happen to anyone, so I'm not judging those actions at all (at least at first). Here are some the highlights as well as some problems I find that are hard to swallow and potentially can break the audience out of the show.1. I love the plot where Lee Na Yeon intentionally poisoned Nam So Ju, although the outcome is very heartbreaking, and I really hated her character at that moment. What the teacher said later is really thought provoking, the teacher apologised to Na Yeon that it's the teacher's fault to let the other students corner Na Yeon. It got me thinking, if I or any other people were in her shoe, where the world was turned upside down, and the only people around you all turned against you because you said something terrible when you were desperate and scared. While she could have apologised to So Ju and that would be a great outcome, but as a teenager and when she felt she was being cornered when she didn't even do anything wrong (in her view), it was understandable as people can do terrible things when they feel they are cornered. And as a teacher, as a grown up, the best way is sometimes not to stand to one side, because one side is right and the other is wrong, but to understand both sides and make sure both sides can talk it out and work on their differences. While at that moment, Na Yeon did seem to be the very eval character we just wish to get rid of, the world is never black and white, and people are not perfect and will make mistakes and say terrible things. And the later scene where Na Yeon was smiling at her classmates' video recording shows she does indeed have feelings toward her classmates, not ""I don't care about any of you"" when she said that, and she even made the resolve to walk past all of the infected to deliver food and drinks to her classmates at last shows she has a good side as well.2. Protagonists pretty much weren't affected by dehydration and hunger when they barely had anything to drink and eat somewhat feels unreal, but I suppose the show wants to focus on the human side rather than survival side.3. This show is about fast Zombies, and protagonists survived several waves of those attacks and even attempt to retrieve a cell phone in a wave of zombies is somewhat questionable. I do understand the urge to get help, but this action would be suicidal if they didn't have the plot armour on them.4. The superhuman zombie mutation with consciousness setting is very annoying and show breaking, it's understandable to have immunity towards it (arguably serves better plot purpose), but come on, super strength, heal automatically, never dies, they can do better than that.5. In later episodes, the show is clearly eager to get rid of more characters, as the decisions they make no longer make sense, and the death feels hollow and scripted. The father who escaped shootings with a minor scratch from soldiers with auto rifles, somehow intentionally want to sacrifice himself when he didn't need to. I mean come on, if you really wanted your daughter to survive, the best thing is to be at her side as you are strongest fighter and survival expert in the group? But instead, after successfully distracted waves of zombies, and there was clearly a room for escape, he choose to fight with those zombie and somehow got bit. Now this circles back to the superhuman mutation problem, if the person can be asymptomatic after bit, surely you don't just eagerly throw yourself and sacrifice yourself while you could wait it out to see if you are asymptomatic or not?6. Bad ending that wasted many opportunities laid by the previous plot.",8
East Asia,"It contains many issues that Korea has. I couldn't stop thinking about Sewol Ferry when kids were not saved by their own country and it broke my heart. I think the plot is great but it could have been much better with writing, acting and editing.",7
East Asia,"It's a disgusting series A lot of blood, and used concept.If it was in 2012 it would have been much better.I wish they came up with a new idea.///////////////",1
East Asia,Only on episode 3 and already hooked this is brilliant.Everything is so good about this show. Its so freaking scary love it!This show is so good that anyone who likes horror should watch it.,10
East Asia,"I really think it an excellent zombie TV series. On Douban, an app in China, used to comment on movies or TV series, etc, many people said that it is not so good, even a bad zombie TV series. I totally can't understand it. They think Onjo is too silly. They think the best choice for Onjo is to kill her best friend immediately after they found out that she was infected. I mean, they are just high school students, and she is Onjo's best friend. When the memories between them showed in Onjo' mind, I can't help crying. She was used to be my best friend. How could she be infected??!! I think what Onjo acted is realistic. That's what a normal people would do at that situation, and not just kill her without mercy. So I am quite disappointed about the rate on Douban, just 6.3/10. However, the rate on imdb makes me realize that there are people who use their brain to watch this TV series.",9
East Asia,"I really like zombie story and I have been watched or read a lot of them. I was really excited with this series when it was coming on netflix, so I decided to watch it as soon as possible. The first episode, I thought it would be a 'different' zombie story but too bad, it doesn't go like that. They missed a lot of details. The cafetaria scene was the worst scene in this series. Gyeong Su turned into a zombie because his scar was infected by zombie's blood, but the other characters who fighting with zombies weren't infected with zombie's blood even they have some scars on their body. It just one of them, when you're more, you will get some ridiculous moment that is not make sense on your logic. It's still fun to watch tho, but don't expect it too much ??",6
East Asia,"This show was a major disappointment for me mostly for two reasons- annoying characters and forced plot.The characters are so fcking annoying and they lacked enough complexity. I know they are teenagers. Still the writers could have added more depth to their personality.The plot seemed extremely forced- a genius dude wanted to help his son fight against his bullies and ended up creating this zombie virus. It seems a bit abnormal for my sake. The bully surviving even after getting bitten (Though it's explained that some people would turn into half-zombies after contacting the virus) also seemed extremely forced to me. It seemed like the writers did everything to save him for the final fight. I've seldom seen someone getting this much plot armour.Some other reasons for me disliking this show are- lack of a complex villain (the bully was trying to murder people for no proper reason at all), zero to no use of gun to make the zombies seem op (Cops fighting against zombies using shields was so painful to watch).",4
East Asia,"I'm about half-way through the season. The show has some flaws, it's not perfect. Nothing is. Expecting this to be a flawless masterpiece is unrealistic and just being an entitled a&&hole.But really, this is a great entry into the zombie canon so far. I think they are doing some really creative things and trying to have some fun at the same time. The pacing is good, the soundtrack is good. They're thinking big-picture about some of the problems that would be encountered and totally Train to Busan-ing ways to solve those problems.Yes, characters sometimes make stupid decision. But honestly, is it realistic for high school kids in ""real life"" to suddenly become apocalypse masterminds as soon as zombies prove to be real and start attacking? Would it be realistic for everyone, even adults, to know the perfect strategy and what to do every time in an intense situation like this? C'mon. Gimme a break.Of course they're not always going to do the smart thing. That's called being a teenager. That's called being HUMAN.This show is taking a balls-to-the-wall stab at doing some fresh with the genre while still respecting the canon that's come before. It's fun to watch. It's also got emotional depth and some real to say under it all.Watch it, eat some popcorn.",8
East Asia,"And... I have seen a lot. The thrill and action with which this series kept me latched to episode after episode - I loved it.The cast did great acting, became a fan of a few actors. Screenplay was amazing, editing was crisp, the zombies were believable (quintessential zombies) and it is worth a second season. I hope to see the characters again.Great job team ""all of us are dead""",10
East Asia,I usually love zoombie themed dramas/movies because of the intense scenes but this was just too cliche and boring. Most importantly I hated almost EVERY character! They just too stupid I cant believe most of them made it so far.,3
East Asia,"I totally love these South Korean series. They are inventive, beautifully made and fun. And there is always a subtle, gentle and tender message. Yes it's a zombie serie but it is somehow sweet. Actors are great and very likeable and direction is brilliant full of inventive touches.BUT..please,please,please find some decent English speaking dubbing actors and translators. These are absolutely painful.",10
East Asia,"Darn this was so amazing
It was so thrilling!! Ofc it's the same old plot about zombies attacking people and biting but what makes its really good is legit EVERYTHING -
Like the character interaction, what all they did for survival and how they saved themselves. The series had people betraying others which made me really mad and frustrated. But it also had amazing characters who sacrificed themselves. The entire acting is amazing and i never got bored. I've been super hyped about it ever since the trailer came and after watching it didn't dissapoint me!! It made me feel soo conflicted and so sad. Really good and worth the hype.",10
East Asia,Enjoyable.itdtiditdtditsitsitsodtditdtixitdixitxotxtodotxitxtcotxoxotcotcotcotcotcktcotcotxitifxoxkgxotcoycoyxoyxogxogxkgxkfzufzurrxifxkgcl.xitddittdiocoyxitzirxhhclghzyeExclvbjgzufohlzudUrsohlxxhljfcogclgxkgogxitzurzitfchlkcg.,10
East Asia,"The serie is quite fun to watch but it doesn't bring anything new or special, unfortunately because sometimes these kind of movies from South Korean production companies can be a hidden gem (i.e. Train to Busan). However, it is really a South Korean zombie production so if you don't like that, don't bother to watch it. However, it doesn't meet the level of TWD but it definitely is much better than FTWD.For those who love South Korean zombie production, All of Us are Dead is worth to watch. Sometimes it is a bit annoying and slow that you start to wonder whether you are watching a highschool serie. However, I binged it in a weekend and I kinda got into the main characters of the serie. I just hope that Netflix won't kill this serie and that it will order a 2nd season as the story got potential for another interesting zombie season.",8
East Asia,"I had high hopes for this one, but I am disappointed after watching one episode. The scriptwriter had to make the characters act so stupidly and make a bunch of dumb decisions so the story could go on. The storyline is cliche and not believable. The only positive thing I can say about this is they are trying to raise awareness of bullying, which is a common issue in Korean society.",1
East Asia,"I am enjoying the show. I think Koreans know how to make a zombie movie or a show. I binge watched it entire Saturday and watched 9 episodes in a row. But since I need to sleep, I will watch the rest (3 episodes the next day, Sunday 30th Jan)",10
East Asia,"Its about choices, ethical dilemmas, power, helplessness, politics, bullying, principles and about what makes life worth living.I found the series to be ok, some of the very typical Korean fat shaming, dumb shaming and self worth through societal achievements, but I guess it comes with the territory.I find it quite weird that there isn't a whole legion of people complaining and calling it woke. Guess they hid it well enough with splatter and gore.Then again most Zombie movies are about us and choices.",7
East Asia,"This series has been pulled unnecessarily into 12 long bad episodes. Extremely slow, and cliche acting and storyline. Some of the actors are so bad, they literally have zero reaction even after seeing a zombie...lol. Does not live up to the over hyped trailers...sigh.",1
East Asia,Overall it was a good drama ...... tears flew from my eyes during all sacrifices......... the survival was epic... But it had too much of blood scene...,10
East Asia,"First moment, it started well but by going end of it, it becomes miserable Korean emotional drama.I couldn't understand characters, I couldn't understand their decisions. Over actings against their families and friends made feeling so stressed.Too much dramas for zombie action. The original webtoon was kind of this, but they shouldn't apply this kind of unnecessary things.And why they chose those bad actors?",7
East Asia,"I read the negative reviews and it was all like ""Zombie is the same"",""Its just another zombie movie"",""Too long and boring""First of all its a series and this is better than walking dead ""for me""
Walking Dead is great tbh im not saying its trash or bad.Second of all its zombies what do you expect at least they added a new aspect of half zombies that has only been used 2-5 times in movies or series.The scene where Namra jumped off school was so cool
And when Lee cheongsan sacrificed his life in the building.Lastly,They are mostly new actors but look at the outstounding work they've showed in the series.",10
East Asia,"George Romero, the movie god who invented the modern zombie, always cast ordinary people as the characters in his films. He wanted zombies to represent us in a world of problems so relentless, so savage and so violent that they threaten to literally eat us alive. He wanted a world without death, with no end to our suffering, where we become the monsters when we die. He wanted the brutality to be banal, familiar and up close, where a world isn't saved by handsome Brad Pitt in three hours of pointless CGI.Everyone has problems, and that is why every country has zombie movies. In Romero's US, the zombies represent a population so self absorbed that they have lost track of what is important to them. Both the surviving humans and the zombies themselves seek refuge in a shopping center because consumerism has replaced idealism in this country, In Venezuela, the zombies represent the rapid disintegration after the madman who ruled the country dies. The Venezuelans who try to escape are killed by their own friends and neighbors. In Africa, the zombies are what happens when nature takes the land back from the humans who are trying to change it. In the UK, zombies make England's island isolation into a prison where escape seems impossible.You all know the movies. If you are reading this review, you like zombies.In Korea, zombies are about young people. Train to Busan is the story of a young girl who survives, but to what end? #Alive is about a young gamer. The Wailing is about the disintegration of a village.Korea is rapidly changing. It becomes more Westernized and industrial every day. The generation that lives through the Korean War is dying, and the ancient culture that sustained the country for centuries is being replaced by a First World country with cutting edge technology. However, Korea still sits between China and Japan, and the threat of annihilation from the crazy man in North Korea is ever present.To that end, this series is both the same old zombie by virus plot, but embedded in the daily horror of high school everyone faces. The bullies are nearly as awful as the zombies, the principal is an idiot, the teachers are a mix of caring and stupid, and the pressure to succeed is painful.Zombies invade a high school through the idiocy of a teacher. There are massive casualties as the kids fight for their lives, Only when it is obvious to everyone that all hope is lost does a teacher admit what has happened and tell the kids to leave. Then it is still every person trying to save himself. The virus that causes the zombie infection is stronger than human connection.Young Koreans face a world in which, no matter how hard they work or how much they care, they are not safe from monsters. Teachers don't care if they are bullied. Friends turn against them. And, everyday, they face oblivion.But they are teenagers, and they try.Romero would like this series.",6
East Asia,"Despite some flaws, this show is a pretty good zombie series and I was rather surprised at how binge-able this was.It did a very decent job of presenting gore, mystery, thrill, drama and--of course--romance. The overall effect of the plot is captivating that you find yourself drawn in. The makeup on the zombies is extremely disgusting, which superbly serves its purpose. The mystery and thrill of the story does a good job to keep you glued to the screen, wanting to know what happens next. Although a lot of characters remain flat, I'm glad they aren't all so one-sided.My biggest gripes of this series are 1) how quickly they get rid of characters without giving them a chance to really make an impact or finish their stories 2) the frustrating decisions some characters make leading to dumb consequences (seems like a theme for a lot of horror/thriller movies, which could be fixed). 3) The color of blood on the costumes at times feel a bit too pink, but that's coming from someone who works in film. 4) The CGI feels very unrealistic at times, which takes you out of the film. If these elements were done better, I think I would have enjoyed this a lot more.If you're into zombie shows, this deserves a shot. It has a lot of gore, endless action sequences, mixed with different character relationships and thrilling nailbiting moments.",8
East Asia,Two third of the first episode is just unnecesarry scene about the characters love life and some bully side story but it has absolute no impact later. After 3 episodes of just running around the school i gave up..,3
East Asia,"Having enjoyed Squid Game, thought I would give this a go, the first scene was very violent but captivating all the same, as the storyline became clearer it became addictive viewing. Only watched 3 episodes but really enjoying this South Korean horror fest. Enjoy.",9
East Asia,"Going into this, I had admittedly high expectations because the trailer looked so good. Those expectations didn't hold up past the first episode, except for the phenomenal acting. All the characters pulled their weight and felt genuine the entire time. However, that is the only great thing about this show.The plot is infuriatingly slow paced with no character development and even less chemistry between the main cast. There are no stand out cinematic scenes, no fun fight scenes, and as the stakes stay the same the entire time, everything starts to blur together.The creators obviously tried to make statements about human nature, bullying, teenage conflict, teenage pregnancy, etc but all of those plot lines were messy and fell apart with no emotional hit on the viewer.I really wish I liked this show. It had potential, but as me and my friend watched it, the #1 overwhelming emotion we experienced was annoyance. If this show was a color it would be gray-- no seriously it's like they had a gray filter over the camera constantly.I don't recommend wasting your time on this. Even for a background noise show, you can find something actually entertaining and bad in a fun way, unlike this. The end makes no sense and isn't fulfilling either.Thank you for reading :)",5
East Asia,7.5 is my correct rating. If you are a fan of zombie series this is definitely your cup of time. This series have heavy brutality and violence and everything looks real. The making camera moment all were fantastic.The main defects were the length. 8 episode were have been perfect but they dragged a lot at the end. The other defects were about the zombies. The zombie should be like the usual like in train to bushan but they changed it . Some of the enfected people don't become zombie and thay get super powers . Feels like they copied sweet home.Anyway it is a fun series for zombie fans. The others may not have liked it and don't expect anything like kingdom.,7
East Asia,"I loved the way the series handles school students facing everything from nasty bullying, true friendship, love to questions about life itself. What if you and your friend are hiding from the zombies, quietly in the restroom, and your friend begins to turn into a zombie, would you kill her? Would you let her eat you, because she cannot help herself?I hope season 2 is made as well!!",10
East Asia,"The first couple of episodes was a bust, i was on the verge of quitting it but I decided to continue and I am glad I did. The reason as a lot of people said before me was the emotions in the first couple of episodes lacked, however further on their emotions do come out. Had some funny parts as well as sad parts. I enjoyed it so watch all the episodes before you rate it because it does get better.",7
East Asia,"Intense and doesn't let up. I had to stop a few times to take a few breaths.The perfect zombie flick, except it is 12 episode long. Koreans do indeed do zombies justice.Ignore those naysayers, just watch it. At least you'll get the ride of your life.",10
East Asia,"If u are expecting it to be like kingdom or train to busan. Then this is not it. Storyline' s a bit mundane, some actings are -meh-. Reviewers here are smitten by the cute Koreans actors period and nothing more. So expect bias reviews and ""don't listen to hater"" quotes used. SIMPS reviews are not actual reviews so do yourself a favour don't waste bingeing this series like I did. You are better off re watching the other awesome zombie series/movies.",1
East Asia,"I love zombie movies and series! And I was so excited to watch all of us are dead, but unfortunately I ended up very disappointed. The very first thing that happened is they mocked Christianity, and as a Christian it doesn't feel very nice, but I decided to give it another chance. I continue and it gets pretty exciting. But I started to get frustrated, the characters keep making stupid decisions, they are so slow to action, and continues to fall ALL THE TIME, even when there is no reason to fall. It's okey one or two times but after a couple of times it just gets tiring. If you love zombie movies like me, you should watch it just for the sake of watching it, I meaning they did a good job and the zombies are fast and threatening, but don't expect the best show of all time.",6
East Asia,The first episode was difficult to watch due to bullying and sexual assault. To begin with the story draws you in and you want the characters to be able survive the zombies apocalypse.As the story continued the characters stories are all intertwined from a horrific event. The overall question became will theses characters be able to survive each other and zombies.,10
East Asia,"Good. It is a Korean zombie film that subtly reveals the current reality of COVID-19 in Korea. The situation in Korea is shown well throughout the scene, so if you want to know about Korea, I recommend you watch this movie.",10
East Asia,This is my fist review!If you are like me and misses the good old chaos of the walking dead this hits the spot! Currently on episode 4 and this buildup is exeptional. Bit slow the first two episodes but worth the wait. The actors make it fun to watch in the original language imo.,9
East Asia,"If you're a fan of the Zombie genre then you should enjoy this. Good mix of character development, gore and thrills.If you're looking for something to watch and a fan of the genre then this will be right up your alley.",7
East Asia,Where do i start... this is about teenagers and puppy love kinda story. The plot is lame and the script is the worst. This is a Zombie series for preteens or younger. Not good... stay away.My 2 stars arr for good zombie effects and cgi.,2
East Asia,"This show has been pretty good thus far as I feel they have stepped it up a notch from the last Korean Zombie series called ""Kingdom"".The special effects look more realistic of the blood spewin from the zombies necks compared to previous korean zombie series and movies also.I dont like watching anything Korean but I do love their zombie stuff cause its always got superb acting. Out of all Asian zombie movies/shows i would say Koreans ranks the top as I have seen some very terrible ones from I believe Thai Or filipino and also Indian zombie series that were trash.Western Zombie stuff is different then the Korean ones from the way they look too how they transform into zombies.What western shows like The Walking Dead lacked was that it became to easy too kill zombies that their was no immediate danger. As well as the zombies all walk slow vs in the korean series they run and move fast and every encounter becomes a very close escape.I seen some bad reviews on here but i feel these people are not giving it a fair judgement. Some complained about how its repetitive like other zombie shows but when u rate a show/movie u should be rating it for itself and not comparing it to other movies/shows.Thats where Bias mindsets always kick in cause they always keep having expectations set already of comparing it to previous zombie shows or even worse is when people compare how an actor acts in other movies vs current ones.So give this show a chance and dont rate it against other shows, thats not giving it a fair chance at all.Just rate it as it is and how it is presented and you will find you will enjoy tv series n movies more then always having a closed mindset with full on expectations of how it shouldnt be or should be directed n written n acted.",9
East Asia,"The series hooks a lot, in realism with which everything happens from the emotional reactions,
government strategies and reaction is very well written.It is one of the few zombie series or movies that I have seen where the protagonists do not start doing illogical nonsense.On the other hand, the level of acting is very good and the staging of some scenes is at another level.",8
East Asia,"Once you get past the second episode it is absolutely amazing!! Episode one and two are too unrealistic. I understand it is just a tv show (it's not real life) but the characters emotions and actions are unrealistic to the point where you don't want to watch it. However, after episode one and two the show becomes absolutely amazing, addictive and enjoyable to watch. Although there are problems with the first 2 episodes I highly recommend everyone to watch this show. And I cannot wait for season 2!!!",10
East Asia,"Violent sexual assault. Extreme bullying.But perhaps worse was a (presumably) real person's review stating that women should be ""rightfully so"" broken in half.",2
East Asia,"Some reviews ""big this up"" and others don't, I'm in the don't camp. Watched E 1&2 then jumped to E 12 to see the ending (nothing special).Seems Korean students ages range from mid-twenties to late thirties. The one upside is not watching the woke inclusive snooze-fest that would be forced upon oneself if filmed in a western country.",2
East Asia,I finish this series in one day ?? to be honest it's very catchy and thise who dislike this zkdrama after watching 1-2 episodes imma advice you guys to take your time and give it another shot because it will be worth! Good and interesting things happen on the middle of the show not at first! You have to be patient. I can't wait for season 2 already if there is gonna be one but i hope yes! I'm obsessed!!! 10 stars from me.,10
East Asia,"I have just done binge-watching the whole drama within a night and have enjoyed it! Well, the plot has some weak points that will be easy to finger-pointing while watching. However, it makes more sense than other monstrous apocalyptic k-dramas on Netflix that I have seen (e.g. Better than Sweet Home in many aspects I'd say).It has pointed out the problem with our justice system and humanity. Also, that, at dangerous moments, it's love and hope that binds us together.Jumping to the ending scene, it's nice that it has ended with giving hope that not everyone that we saw dead is actually dead. I bet that if there's a second season, it'll show Cheong-san surviving the bombing (by becoming a mutated zombie like Gwi-Nam with self-regenerating power).",7
East Asia,"A really enjoyable thriller of a zombie outbreak in korea, most of the characters are really well written, a few plot holes, but other than that this show was worth binge watching.",9
East Asia,"Pilot was very weak I must say But show picks up pace in completely contrasting fashion from second episode and depicts almost everything a lover for zombie shows wants.But it's NOT for you if you can't stand Gore at all.Well obviously you can't compare it to 'The Walking Dead' but they have done a very good job.So if you love zombie shows, give it a shot one episode beyond the pilot.",8
East Asia,"The very less important part of this series is the forced division of roles, such as the role of parents of the main female and male characters because it ends in vain, and the role of the police which is considered to give hope, just happens, and along with the death of members per group, which seems forced, even though there is no need why in all episodes must be sacrificed.",6
East Asia,"This show is very good
Teen age drama in me made this even better
An Emotional Touch Development From Esme Joe Characters Is Also Good
And yah show is nothing less than a masterpiece to me
So go and hurry to the show
look at.",10
East Asia,"Wow is it really stressful to watch #AllOfUsAreDead ? I really want to tune in but seeing all of the reaction makes me think twice lol. What else is there to say about this series once for sure, even those who like zombies must see it.",10
East Asia,"First of all, when zombie attacks started, I thought same thing like other comments ;'welcome to train to Busan', till now it ok for me I am on second episode. A little slow and too long but still ok. Some scenes are really good as a cinematography, Korean people knows how to make tension.I will not say this is a disturbing zombie series.",8
East Asia,You know korea has made many amazing zombies movies and they never disappoint us. This movie is also one of the best zombies. You should definitely try this.,8
East Asia,I was expecting a good zombie series. The setting is not bad.Most of the characters are useless.There's nothing interesting. Boring. Bad script.Some of the kids are not good at acting.,2
East Asia,I can give up on my soul to watch this drama for the first time once again. This is one of the best show i have watched so far. And I really am waiting for a season 2. :((,10
East Asia,"This show is so different from every other zombies movie or series, It's very interesting how the virus works which we find out later, the virus was supposed to help the weak, it's not just that but I won't say too much but it's so interesting and it's not some stupid action movie, and it breaks a lot of stereotypes of tv series, and the best thing is the characters know how zombies work, it's so meta. It's rlly good.",10
East Asia,"First, its boring. How come a zombie movie boring? Thats surprised me as well.The writing is so bad. Is the story writer newbie?The story went slowly, they try to put emotional scenes, but the scenes were not touching at all. Theres a lot of crying but im not even feel sad. And im actually easily moved.I try so hard not to skip and fast forwards those episodes.What with the teen love story? They have no chemistry, so intead of moved by their hearts, its just like some baseless stupid move.The students were not so bright, 6 episodes and none of them try to hold something for a weapon with them all the time, not even broom or a stick. I get it if they are stupid, but having a survival instinct would be rational.Im questioning all of their decisions. Lol. These kids have no hope.And finally, none of the cast that makes you feel like ""i hope they survive"", if at the end all of them is dead, its not even surprising, and even satisfying. Seeing how thise kids act in the middle of crisis.The only good stuff is the bloody scenes, those are executed well. But still, you need to skip like half of the time to see bloody scenes.",3
East Asia,"I avoid trailers nowadays, I check the description, who is in it and who made it and that seems to work for me. I really enjoyed this series, binged with my wife. If ur looking for a good zombie horror action with some kdrama and kquirks this is really good, just note the 1st episode sets up the show so it's abit slow.",8
East Asia,"If you are bored and nothing to watch I'll recommend this. But whenever that high school girl acting like damsel in distress i fast forward. Like come on, if you're faced on this situation adrenaline must kick in and stop being like you need someone to save you. Her character is annoying.",6
East Asia,"This was a great 12 episode TV show for me.If you like Train to Busan and Kingdom, this is a great show for you.This show is a treat as it has tons of gore.There are some plot holes or things that didn't make sense but overall this is another Korean show that will go in my top 10 of awesome zombie shows/movies.Cannot wait for season 2.",9
East Asia,"Don't waste your time with this. It's boring and stupid. You'll be frustrated by the characters actions and dialog.For example:
Spoilers: if you're alone in a science lab and you hear a rattling sound, the sensible thing would be to RUN or WALK AWAY. And not snoop in. Most definitely NOT insert your finger in a caged hamster! Seriously! How dumb was that???",1
East Asia,"I want to take my medicine when someone prays.Please pray for me first to the end of the day.Please forgive me
I have nowhere to look.I want it I want it.",10
East Asia,"The main characters were not smart. They knew it was zombies, yet did not bother to smash the brains. Also, so many stupid decisions made by the characters - only to make everything more dramatic.",1
East Asia,"Great kdrama, it was nerve-wrecking, horryfying. Love the fact that no character presented as perfect and the storyline reflects many societal problems that we know but usually ignore.Overall, I recommend to watch!",10
East Asia,"This show brings absolutely nothing new to the zombie genre and falls for all the same pitfalls zombie movies from 2002 fell for.Zombies in drama teenage school with a little bit of bullying undertone but nothing ever feels like a _complete story_.It's just a string of events and 1 dimensional comic book-like characters who serve exactly one purpose: the sad girl, the maniac bully, the fat kids who loves chicken. It's almost satire.Entertaining background noise but I can't help to think - was this conjured by an AI?",4
East Asia,"This is way far better than all The Walking Dead seasons combined. Highly recommended for both who likes the zombie genre and those who doesn't like it.This isn't your usual, ordinary, zombie show. It's full of character development, real life and realistic drama, and lessons in survival and life itself.",10
East Asia,"I know these people were just thrown into a zombie apocalypse but there are just decisions some of these characters make that just require common sense.Example: if you see the privileged loner girl wiping blood off a mop handle, SAY SOMETHING before she uses it to infect one of her own.Also who cares about honorifics and courtesy during an attack on your schoolAnd then there is Cheong-su's mom, who braves Hyosan to try to get to her child and get through many infected except she doesn't realize one of his friends is infected and stupidly calls out to him.",5
East Asia,Excellent series with lots of emotions mixed by koreansKoreans really know how to make a zombie flick!Great character building and introduction of the different plotlines.Two episodes in and it's mayhen and chaos all over the school!As you go on more characters and different situations are presented and it all unfolds perfectly.It is really well paced and non-stop action. A dramatic scene here and there but not too much to get you bored.Freaky zombie outbreak like I've never seen before (only in Train to Busan).I can't wait to see how it all plays out.,10
East Asia,It is a good web series and its story is also very nice. The way it is directed is also very good and I want to watch its season 2 And i am requesting watch this series once you will also be a fan of it.,10
East Asia,"In general, I would say this is a very good show. I admit there are some flaws in some plots. You can still call this zombie show a good one. It covers a lot of topics. High school campus life, school bullying, society problems, politics, friendship, love, humanity. All of this elements in one show, compared with some other zombie show, this one is extraordinary.",9
East Asia,"From starting to end, not a single second seemed boring, neither the ending is predictable nor the characters you will think definitely survive will survive. It's gory, it's emotional, it's amazing. Just don't believe in bad reviews, they must have bad taste. From the first episode you'll see how amazing this series is and you'll end up binged watching it. If you like Train To Busan, you're going to love All Of Us Are Dead.",10
East Asia,Was this supposed to be the Korean version of Stranger Things? I love Asian cinema but this is so childish And badly acted that I quit after one episode. Move along. Nothing to see here.,1
East Asia,"Those korean kids acts like they have some kind of retardation themselves. It is too far from reality. I know, zombies are far as well, however it is about them before turning into zombies. My god, they do absurd things, when they are trying too much scaping from zombies is ridiculous, they go out the building go back inside, no one even tries to scape from there.The drama itself do not convincing anyone. What I observed: they are smarter when they get infected, what is hilarious, I do not know how young Koreans are actualy, but if they are like that then South Korea has dark times upcoming. The scenes, their decisions, everything is a lame in this terrible series. I think if there is some screenwriter that is an idiot, ok. But there are: producers, directors and actors themselves. How, in this world that could be convincible? HOW in this world? I fear that from few years ago to the future, the cinema is not an art anymore it is just a bunch of crazy inflated egos trying to do over and over the samep s..t.",3
East Asia,I watched all episodes. Overall it was a good watch. Sometimes it becomes boring too see some long conversations. They seem to be usesless. Yes i understand there is a philosophy about this show but they don't need to smash it all the time.,6
East Asia,This is actually a masterpiece.. Korea knows how to dissolve someone's heart .. they provide best zombie cinematic with lots of emotions and all characters are frictional..,10
East Asia,"Each and every episode just hooked n booked but only the last episode of the series little bit slow n length of episode felt ,but at the conclusion I just wanna say it's completely horror + thriller combo which is made must watch drama.",10
East Asia,"Ive readed this manhwa and it was quite enjoyable. But ive noticed theres so much other things on this serie. Some of them are quite enjoyable, but at the other some arent. Pretty disappointed.",5
East Asia,"This series is like a heaven for zombie lovers. 12 hours of constant fast paced zombies. Story is good, acting is good. The way they created the scene and casted actors, everything is amazing. I watch even stupid zombie movies, but this one was done really really well. Go for it. After Kingdom, train to busan this is one of best next gem from Korean cinemas. Congrats to all the team !!",10
East Asia,"One of the best zombie series out there. Don't believe ,check it out. Let me tell you Zombie isn't my thing. I'm shocked how I fell in love with the series.(I suck at reviews , hope you get wht I mean to say)The characters are so well written and so well played, one can clearly see the human behaviour and how they change according to situation.The friendship ,the way the characters stepped up sacrificing themselves for others , so selfless , so bold and so touching. Every character has it's deapth ever sacrifice had it's meaning , totally touched by this series , I wish you wld too.( P.s - I'm in love with the character Lee CheongSan , man hez the real hero )",9
East Asia,"Irritating Characters, Slow moving storyline and Horrible Screenplay are few of the many flaws..Had the potential for a good movie but it was stretched to become a 12 Hrs of struggle.",1
East Asia,"Is this a great zombie outbreak show? Yes. Is it plauged by the occasional cheesy comic relief cliches at points? Also Yes. But this show goes so much further than that. In the end it's less about the zombies and more about the horrific trauma the outbreak inflicts on everyone involved. It shows the perspective of survivors as well as rescuers and military. No one is spared from the effects of this nightmare and nothing is black and white. It's honestly tough to watch at times and nauseating to see what these people have to go through, but it's refreshing in the sense that it isn't just a mindless hack and slash zombie flick and actually deals with tragedy as well as moral and ethical dilemmas. Highly Recommend.",9
East Asia,"I liked Train to Busan so when they said that a new Korean zombie show was coming out I was really excited. The trailer looked good and I'm for TV series over movies to tell a big story all day any day. I thought it was cool that they had some scientific explanations for the zombie outbreak and not just ""it started"". It was also cool to have 12 hours to cover surviving a zombie apocalypse rather than 2 in a movie. But the show really fell flat.For starters, the plot was really ridiculous at times. The virus origin story was just ""what""? So the teacher's son was bullied, and instead of protecting him, moving him to another school, finding ways to prove the bullies' guilt, using his status as a teacher to push for punishment, signing him up for self defense classes and basically everything rational... he injects his son with a new virus he just created? I'm impressed he was able to contain his son and wife at home without getting hurt himself btw. Then when the virus broke out his actions were really inconsistent. He was agitated at first when finding out that the student he chained up was released. But then he took centuries to explain everything. Also he sent the cop to his computer to retrieve the solution when it was just ""burn them all""? I was really hoping this character would be developed and utilized more, since the scientific side of a zombie virus is pretty interesting and would've separated this series from other zombie shows.Moving on, the characters that we follow are mostly not very likable. There were some actors that were horendous at acting too. Zombie in your face and these kids just poker face... I get that these kids are just teenagers, but it's a zombie apocalypse, one of the kids actually mentioned Train to Busan in episode 1 or sth, lets get to work with building up defenses, armoring up, finding resources, figuring out what's going on outside... can we save the meaningless squabbles and love triangle drama for later? The kids also act very dumb at times. Can we throw an infected person out of the room before they actually become a zombie and get another person bitten? Yes I can imagine it being tough when it's a friend or family, but sometimes they really go over the top with it and just makes the characters seem stupid and irrational. Neither the protagonists nor the antagonists were particularly well written, and I can't help feeling that the writer had something against women in general. I get that Asia's gender expectations are more traditional, but most of the females just cowered behind while the guys did all the work. Like seriously? You need the guys to tell you to help them push and not just sit behind and watch?Half way through the series become more about the conscious ""half zombies"" than the rabid thrashing ones, which is okay, but the subplots were quite underwhelming too. The bully's obsessed with the male lead. The bullied girl decides that the person she wants to avenge the most is... the guy that tried to comfort her at the rooftop? Class president gained these super powers and couldn't die anymore... and she couldn't do anything to help? Like go out, find a safe path, find food & water? It's like having Spiderman with an invisibility buff on your team and he does almost nothing. They spent half an episode on making toilets, a much more mundane matter that nobody asked for.I wanted to like the series. I really did. I watched it as soon as it came out, but in the end it was kind of underwhelming. It wasn't terrible, it was a thrill to watch people run away from the zombies, but many of the times when they weren't actively fighting or escaping the zombies ended up pretty frustrating.",7
East Asia,"I don't understand all the bad ratings, I really liked it. Some characters not so much, but in general I really liked it. It was entertaining and comical.",10
East Asia,"It's definitely one of the better zombie flicks. The acting is great, the story is good. I would have given it a 7 or 8 if it weren't for two very annoying things, that I couldn't get past:1. They had literally nothing to eat or drink for what seemed more than two days, while half the time running, fighting zombies, climbing up and down buildings, and parkouring. Non of them seemed pretty fazed about that and apart from a few comments, the lack of vital sustenance in a zombie apocalypse, was considered pretty much like an insignificant detail, rather than the difference between life and death.2. Decision making and reactions were at points absurdity itself. Someone is bitten, turning, and will kill us all - let's stare and see what will happen - that, on more than one occasion. Zombies are attacking my friends - let me stare for a while and then hit them with a book. We have to make other split second decisions - again let's stare. There's a lot of staring going on.Overall, however it's a good movie if you get past this and some other annoying details.",6
East Asia,One of the best Zombie series I have seen.. I don't know why some give negative reviews.. Seriously what you guyzz expect in zombie series???emotional scenes are good.. Zombie scenes nice... I could rate 10/10.,10
East Asia,"If you want to have a good laugh with friends, you've come to the right place. I've reached the conclusion that this series was actually produced, funded, filmed,
directed and acted by the high school teenagers themselves. What a scream...",1
East Asia,As with all Korean shows there are things that have to be ignored if you're not Korean yourself like the main characters arguing over how a junior student in the school spoke to a senior one when there are Zombies trying to break down doors and kill everyone.Moving on from that the show has very good production value and special effects are on par with anything else out there.The characters are engaging and make you feel everything from happiness to sadness and everything in between. The show keeps you invested and you can never be sure who the next person to be killed will be. The cast is very good and fully engaged in what they do every min they are on the screen which in turn keeps you engaged as well.The only criticism is that some episodes are somewhat samey and in effect become fillers. They show could be a minimum of 2 if not more episodes shorter and still have the same impact.Final verdict is that while it's not by any means ambitious or life changing but in my humble opinion well worth watching.I binged it over one weekend and quite a happy camper.,8
East Asia,"There is no story line, the crew want to keep themselves safe.. the main female character acts so baaaddddddd... But for production need applause worthy... VFX and CGI are really good.",5
East Asia,Shame cause first episode was amazing zombies runing around people runing away really good action.But then second episode kids drama and plot armor to main kids.They start kicking zombies ash and.one kid is Jett Lee.3 episode is the same way i just got tierd of it.Shame cause first episode was amazing!,1
East Asia,"Ok, it's not the 'Train to Busan stopping first at high school' that I had hoped it would be but I quite enjoyed it. It might benefit from there being a bit of a lull in good stuff being released right now though(?).It basically follows the progress of a couple of groups of kids (most focus being on the the one, larger group) as they try to escape the zombie infested high school.Along the way, stuff happens - some more interesting than others, some of it is really quite stupid and there are times when I felt like switching off but am glad I didn't. The first episode or two in particular are a bit... iffy...Watch it expecting a Young Adult horror series and you'll enjoy it more than if you go into it expecting it to be outright horror.",7
East Asia,"Solid zombie high school K-drama. Beautiful and memorable precious things about High schools and friends are shown inside this show. Suspenseful, heartbreaking and very interesting! Legit acting. This tv series deserves recognition. Overall, very promising and recommend to watch.",9
East Asia,"I rate this show a 10/10 because it deserve a better ranking , and its the only zombie show that i like the most.I felt really connected to the characters .I had high hopes for this show and eventually im not disapointed.",10
East Asia,"So, original ideas have apparently vanished. This show is pretty much a live action Korean version of the anime: high school of the dead. It's just, Meh! Has none of the originality and entertainment value of the original. Very disappointed.",3
East Asia,"I'm giving this a rating because I've only lasted two episodes. The action scenes are very well done -- high school kids make wonderfully enthusiastic, energetic extras, whether they're twisting and twitching as man-eating zombies or frantically fleeing the same man-eating zombies.But the scenes without zombie action are ridiculously amateurish: stiff, slow, and lethargic. I began to lose patience when a bunch of high school students, having narrowly escaped the zombies that have overrun their school, feebly barricade themselves inside a classroom and stand around calmly musing how best to phone the police.The scene drags on like a slow dinner party. Two girls stare out the window and literally chat about their teenage relationships (one of them grinning impishly), while just a few feet away, separated by thin panes of glass, a mob of red-eyed students-turned-zombies wave and growl and hungrily gnash their teeth.Zombie movies are by definition silly. Still, if they're to work, the human characters in them should behave with at least some semblance of reality.",8
East Asia,"All of Us Are Dead: Zombie outbreak at a high school in Hyosan. South Korea. Most of characters are meant to be 16-17 but this is really an adult drama, when the students turn Zombie they bite out throats, take chunks out of people. Victims and Zombies alike jump and fall out of windows, frantic boys and girls barricade themselves in classrooms, battle against the Zombies. Fast moving action just like the Zombies who sprint about. Subplots about bullying and teen romance help the narrative along while the school principal wants to pretend everything is ok. A horror series which shocks but the terror is leavened by the teen love stories. The outbreak spreads. Zombie hordes charging at lines of riot police, even 3 deep they struggle to hold them back. Zombies munching on intestines. The dranas between the still human students becoming more intense. Refugees fleeing Hyosan are ""othered"", feared, even attacked. As so ften happens the authorities abandon the inhabitants of Hyosan while pretending to help them. It's an old trope but is given new life (or death) here due to the editing, acting and direction. How the Zombie virus was created is gradually revealed, it's root cause tied in with events which transpired at the school, you'll have to watch the series to put everything together, no spoilers here! Really convincing acting and effects. Directed by Lee Jae-kyoo and Kim Nam-su. Written by Chun Sung-il. 12 episodes on Netflix. 9/10.",9
East Asia,"Should've been 8 episodes or 10 maximum. A lot of High School drama should've been on the Editing floor.Good performances by everyone.Scene of Cheongsan and his Zombie mom stood out for me. It was very Heartbreaking.A reasonably well made coming of age teenage zombie action drama. No horror though, did not feel any scare during the whole show. It was Action.",7
East Asia,"Think Freakish and Walking Dead: World Beyond with the frequent intensity of Train to Busan, but so much better than the first two. Even with some of the cliched relationships and instances, this still felt much more creatively original than the garbage that's come out of the US for the past decade.",8
East Asia,"""Don't listen to the haters"" lol. There is a reason this show has mixed reviews. The story is lacking, common sense doesn't exist, characters are inconsistent with their actions, zombie infection makes no sense, people zombifies based on length of their last farewell speech. It feels like the script was written to purposely annoy viewers.If you're bored and have absolutely nothing to do or watch, go for it. Otherwise, you can skip this one. Go watch Squid Games. Much better than this.",1
East Asia,"I am one of those who read webtoon before, the original webtoon is perfect! The female protagonist isn't annoying and is addictive to male like series. For some reason this turned out to be super power zombie fighting and the most unforgivable part is the fight between normal human vs mutation one. (the mutation is lost by the way lol). The dad of onjo tried to save his daughter bravely but died so wastefully. I strongly recommend reading webtoon. It is much much better. I give this 5/10 somehow I can relate this to the original one.",5
East Asia,"The show is mid and all imma say is, it's the characters fault. It could have been good but 80% of the characters are written so dumb. Almost all of them are the female characters.At one point they're trying to make a fire to warm themselves and they keep struggling for like 10 minutes and all of a sudden this one girl goes I have a lighter and I'm like b**** why u didn't say that earlier. And there is that other girl who used to get bullied a lot, she got infected but isn't a zombie, all she got are superpowers and she uses them to kill someone who comforted her a lot of times in the past infront of the military and other people. And then she gets shocked when the military dudes take her away and lock her up like bruh what u expect when u bite someone to death??? Stupid b****.",5
East Asia,This series is one of the best zombie survival. It resembles train to busan. But it eas great to show the series interesting throughout 12 hours. Not boring at any place. Many seat cornering scenes are there . One of the best thriller k drama after squid game. Worth for 12 hours.,8
East Asia,"So I decided to give the live action a go because I saw it's No 4 in Ireland on Netflix right now and I found out that it is based off a Webtoon. Yeah it's not a great art so definitely this was the better version personally! I may not be a fan of zombie themed stuff because they are always obvious and you know wtf was going to happen. I mean, this series isn't any different from every zombie flick out there but at least it puts some twists and turns to make you interested. I honestly was interested with how the character Na-ra was able to look less zombish and able to jump from the roof like a ninja?! Yeah I am assuming that cliffhanger would be left to s2 or just giving us poor audience a tease to make out what really happened in our heads. Even if the ending was pretty much a very questionable one, the characters, the music and the storyline in a way were entertaining enough. Yes it is clique in some parts with,using recycled horror tropes but again, I really enjoyed it and glad I didn't bother with the Webtoon...",7
East Asia,"I'm looking forward to it.And zombies are the best
I wanna see next season drm
This is very nice see and fun.I want to recommend it this drama.Hahahahahaha.",10
East Asia,"Don't give up after 2-3 episodes.I'm not a huge fan of the genre, and I skimmed through a lot of chase scenes because they get to be a bit repetitive.However, I found myself enjoying this show more and more. While there are familiar tropes from past zombie show playbooks, there are plenty of new things in the show that have kept me engaged throughout.",8
East Asia,"It's a good show. Sometimes too long. Could have been shorter at about 8 episodes. I found myself just forwarding lot of moments and during that nothing happened. Just people watching into each other eyes. And that's a lot of minutes. Sometimes, i questioned a lot of decisions. But reminded myself these are just a bunch of kids who are supposed to be 15-17 years old. In addition, this is happening in an Asian society so a lot of decision makings are just different from kids who are in a western country.The Character developments are okay. We see different types so it'll be easy for people to recognize themselves in the kids.Some comedic moments are added to the show to lighten it. Some scenes are just gore.The ending leaves space for a part 2.Overall it's a good show to watch. Not perfect. But good.",7
East Asia,"To be honest, the first few episodes were quite entertaining. But the dumb and annoying characters really killed the show for me. One stupid and unnecessary decision after another.The girls act mostly like some annoying, spoiled, and rude wannabe Rambos. And most boys, on the other hand, are some weak cowards without a spine or any integrity. The characters (except for a few) were so annoying to the extend that I was desperately hoping they would get killed.Trash writing and mostly trash characters. What a disappointment.",3
East Asia,"Some very cringey moments, idiotic decisions made by characters and it drags too but once you get used to it you can get hooked.Not the best Zombie show out there but it's quite entertaining. Hope they make Season 2.",7
East Asia,The best zombie movie i have seen. Before this my best zombie movie was world wat z. If u have time i recomand u to watch this all at once. I t will bring u horror and sadness.,10
East Asia,"Some scenes do not make sense, like the open wound on a hand being able to infect people being wiped with contaminated cloth yet when the infected blood goes into the mouth or eyes while hanging over the fighting survivors and nothing happens makes no sense. When the survivors were fighting the infected during the barricade scenes, their fingers were exposed and would have easily been bitten off. The scene with the bully not using the girl with the pink shirt as bait while coming out of the supply closet made no sense to lure the survivors and open the roof door instead of climbing the pipe like spider-man. Military fighting scenes should have used silencers on the weapons and night vision. Helicopter should not have had loud engine sound or bright spot lights because it could have used heat signature optics.The survivors should have had more improvised weapons that were deadly, like the drone scene being modified with a gun or explosive as it would have made more sense. For example, the girl survivors had long hair that could have easily been grabbed by infected. During the barricade scenes, the infected would have grabbed their long hair and dragged toward the barricade and bit their necks. The scene with the sound wave drones makes no sense that it did not affect the hambies or half human/infected mutants. The 119 father character only grabbing one gun from the police station made no sense after visiting the armory and would have gotten far more weapons.Too many plot holes occurred such as what happened to the orange vlogger, detective/other cop, and survivors at the concentration camp. The bully kid would have survived falling the fourth time since the height of the school was taller than the construction site. Plus, the bully survived getting PIERCED from the construction site height. It does not make sense the bully would be dead after falling from the construction site (about five stories) compared to the roof of the school building.",8
East Asia,"...watching someone turn into a zombie before they take action? You take action before they get off the floor and try to bite you. It can be forgiven the first time (maybe even the second time), but every time? And it seems all the kids know zombie lore (one of them even mentions Train to Busan), yet don't act accordingly to defend themselves?I've been watching a lot of Korean shows, and there's a trend where people don't do the right thing so they don't embarrass themselves or the job. And everyone always seems to be up for a job review, and it's better to let people die rather than speak up to avoid a negative review. Is it a narrative staple in Korea, or is that actually the culture (like the incessant crying in Korean tv and movies)?I'll still watch the shows because they're still a hell of a lot better than the American crap.",5
East Asia,"At first, it seemed boring, but it became more fun toward the second half. I watched it all in three days. It can be said to be the best zombie series. I hope season 2 comes out soon.",10
East Asia,I think the whole story was underwhelming and mediocre and some of the characters plot armour is just so crazy that sometimes it annoys you. The only redeeming quality for this series is the cinematography and some of the side characters.,3
East Asia,"I binged watch this and finished the whole series in one day because I got addicted. This movie astonished me and I really like it. Tho I wish there are somethig the writers did add such as when Naeyon apologize to them, the girl , who was filmed while nude, got revenge to Gwinam, the bully, and many more. I don't understand why some people don't like this series 'cause for me it's a masterpiece. I'm really hoping for season 2, for Cheongsang to be still alive and his endgame with On Jo , I wanna see them as couple they are cute. Yes, good actor and almost good writing for me.",10
East Asia,"Honestly speaking , I thought this would be just a random zombie series that others usually do . But this one hits different . There are a few lags in between , yes but none of them matter coz that's what adds up to show . The start maybe a bit slow where the students hide in different rooms but after the 4th episode, I binged till the end. That's how the show keeps you hooked up . Kudos to everyone involved and thankyou for such an amazing experience.",10
East Asia,"Please watch 1ep for 1day.if one at a time it feels boring
Some Repeat fights, but story is a some little bit unique.Camera work is best, You need Spoiler ??????,",4
East Asia,"Honestly, the trailer looked awesome but the show itself is absolutely disappointing! It's so slow, so much talking and too many plotlines that are not needed.The gore was okay but could've been better. So many characters did not make sense, within a matter of minutes the virus has made half human and half zombie without there being a follow up on that.Characters that should've had a big impact on the story end up being pointless. There is more time spent talking and sitting around a fire than there is zombies. They spend so much of the time running from room to room which could easily been avoided if they just secured the room.The fact that too many characters are annoying and just do nothing for the story.This show is bad. Really bad. I do not recommend.",3
East Asia,"Did not meet my expectation, I was excited for this show when I saw the trailer.But after watching thru episode 5 I gave up.The sound of bones creeking and how the body moves when they are turning into zombie is lame.Its like sadako ish.The story is boring, too much dialogue and drama.Students are not going hungry.I know some people will enjoy this but not me maybe because walking dead set the standards high.The only korean zombie series that is good is the Kingdom.",2
East Asia,"Idk how people are rating this series with 8 or even 6 and above. Absolutely horrible acting by the cast and honestly the worst storyline...Makes me even more appreciative of ""The Kingdom"" series and the movie ""Train to Busan"", which were so well made with great acting/casting.Gae-no-jam.",1
East Asia,"After watching it, we can be sure there won't be any season 2. Cause they finished it beautifully. But still hoping for another season. You should also watch the lead actress's (Ji-hu)'s great masterpiece ""House of Hummingbird""",8
East Asia,"It was not bad, but because Chong Sung is dead, I give a low grade. But It was worth seeing again and It was fun, but It could still be better and not so sad.",10
East Asia,"I had enjoyed a lot. Which ever zombie movie ever seen which is full of thiller and fantastic startagy which makes me appreciate for giving more rather
I had never seen movie like this l have watched the movie 5 times again and again with full details of existing and excitement.",10
East Asia,This series is very exciting and unpredictable. The actors were well chosen and played their roles beautifully. The series had a good social critique of the state of society.,10
East Asia,"Very good series, covering the bullying problem in schools well.Not too reliant on CGI and no sugar coated happy ending that you get with American programmes/films.",9
East Asia,"As a big consumer of zombie subgenere, I always look for new stuff, and I really enjoied this one. However, it must be seen in korean and with subtitles, otherwise, it's boring.",9
East Asia,"Just your typical zombie movies like the ones in West, too much drama stupidity and no logic. They even say have you watch the movie Train to Busan? And still not learn anything from it, the police and soldiers aren't even using guns in the beginning episodes.",1
East Asia,"This teenage zombie drama really is a piece of work. Usually when series are slow going i use the skip button to go 10 secs ahead in time. I did this from episode 4-12 (probably skipped 75%, and I feel like i didn't miss a thing. Overall the plot was manageable to follow, however far too stretched out. It seemed like these kids were completely braindead - as mentioned by other honest reviewers - and clearly noticeable(!).(Spoilers from here)
There is just too much to say about these characters! This one girl decides to kill a ""Welfie"", a boy who receives welfare payments, by infecting him intentionally (She seemed like a completely normal kid, however is now a psychopath murderer)? The other kid goes carelessly around killing anyone who says something barely considered mean? There is just too much here that doesn't feel thought out.I would compare this to me, 12 years of age, randomly scribbling down all my emotions and fantasies of action, chronologically, without even reading through it twice before submitting to the writers competition.",3
East Asia,"I've always been a great fan of zombie shows, and was totally looking forward to this! Loved Train to Busan, Kingdom and had high hopes for this.Love
This show has great make-up effects, a fair amount of humour, and an interesting storyline. Story was unpredictable, and had good twists and turns.Hate
But throughout the movie, I felt irritated so many times by the poor decisions made by the characters - like seriously questionable kinds that resulted in unnecessary sacrifices.Overall a good show, but 4 stars deducted from that.",6
East Asia,"A lot of k-drama fans too supportive about all k-dramas but this is kinda disappointed and STUPID. I'm sorry but usually Korean actors are great but in this series it's so embarrassing and awkward, storyline is stupid and even the zombie is faster but the story is too slow. 12 episodes of NONSENSE.",3
East Asia,"Unfinished entanglements
Repetitive and boring scenes
Maybe this series is good for teenagers
But it is not good for adults at all because it is very artificial
Do not waste your time.",2
East Asia,"This show is about as bad and nonsensical as ""Train to Busan"". It's another storyline for people who don't mind having every element spoonfed to them through tropes and stereotypes. It offers no new takes on zombies, Korea's bullying culture, cheesey romantic crushes, or the ability of those in charge to take action rather than cover up an issue. If you're looking for a quality zombie story, this will be 14 hours of your life misspent. It's almost as bad as ""Z Nation"" but without the failed attempts at humor.",2
East Asia,"I think the director was forced to kill atleast one main character in each episode...literally one or 2 main character/s die in each of the episodes.....and the origin story was basically trash ,but the school plot was quiet interesting that makes you watch the whole season....so that is it....conclusion: the origin story could have been better.",7
East Asia,"Decent zombie action but too much drama. What is 12 1 hour episodes could have been 6 45 minute episodes. Too much filler so after a couple episodes everything is too repetitive. The bullying trope is really corny and overdone. The main villain's motives are unrealistic. None of the characters are likeable. I think this show is overhyped because of the ""squid game"" momentum that Korean shows have. Overall it is a mid series.",3
East Asia,"Undoubtedly koreans are the best. The story contains everything. Friendship, love, humanity, thrill, adventure, fear, cruelty. What else we need. Could nt find any single flaw in this series. And also each and every scene is delightful to watch. Right from first scene its been a terrific making from koreans. We have to agree.",10
East Asia,"This Zombie show absolutely DID NOT disappoint! From the very jump you have a scene of a boy being bullied then turns Z. From there it gets a bit slow until about the end of the 2nd episode. I'm glad they showed us what happened and how the Zombies came to be even though it was slower. It showed us some of the students backgrounds, who was doing what, the love interest and gave it us context to to alot of what's going on and why.In one of the scenes they start to freak out once they realize there's zombies at the school and one of them even mentions "".. this is just like train to Busan!"" From that moment I was in love!! Every zombie show movie Iv ever seen they act like they've never seen a zombie film and they're all panicking on what to do. This one they acknowledged the zombies called them zombies and somewhat knew what to expect. There's a twist in how some of the infected act which I'm wondering will have to be a big part in season 2. Don't mind what these low rating reviews are saying it's a MUST watch especially if you're a zombie thriller fan! It just has a little of what everyone likes in a film. 10/10 kind cannot be changed!",10
East Asia,"I just finished season 1 and I get the first 3-4 episode were meh... the kids made a lot of trash decisions. I do like a lot of apocalyptic movies/series, So its a 9/10 I know its to high but... well see how it goes with Season 2.",9
East Asia,"Not usually a fan of zombie genre because I get annoyed by dumb decisions and obvious plot armors. But this one the dumb decisions can be excused because they're made by kids and most of the time the kids are pretty smart for their age and experience. I'm only annoyed by one bad guy being too OP, would've been 9 otherwise.Got hooked after 1 episode and it's interesting to see high shcool drama mixed with zombie outbreak.",8
East Asia,Typical Zombie episodic show. They could have done this very well with a 2 hour movie skipping a lot of the unnecessary character subplots which were way too long. They even reference a Zombie flick Train to Busan. Acting for the most part was very good as well as the location shooting.,5
East Asia,"Being an zombie movie how you can think to make it realistic. I think writer thought what if we face zombies as same as we faced covid..That lee na character you killed her in a funny way.. And then the father who fought so hard to reach and protect her daughter and you just give them hardly two minutes. She still remained the same with,You made the villain hero by killing cheosang.All of us are dead! How? You should kill all then, why some left
Complete disappointment..",5
East Asia,"Recently South-Korea seems to be on a zombie streak. This has come with some great hits (Train to Busan and Kingdom) and some terrible misses. Unfortunately this show is more miss than hit.The first half of the show holds its own, as character deaths are swift and believable. The engine is chugging with proper tension, low on melodramatic scenes.Unfortunately the second half of the show, especially after the reveal of the halfbies, is rife with melodramatic scenes and long drawn out shots trying desperately to make the viewer sad. Very cheap tactics are used multiple times. (Parents of girl X die, mother of boy Y dies, and father of girl Z dies.)Another disappointment is the asymptomatic angle. It is never explored further than to find a tactic to lure zombies with high pitch noise. The last we see of the second halfbie is the lab being wiped clean.Initially I thought the halfbie angle could be interesting but it is never properly explored, except to serve us a recurring 80's Hollywood enemy. In the end I think they should have toned down the halfbie angle and gone with a more interesting approach of how to deal with asymptomatic carriers. It had a lot of potential.Unfortunately a lot of potential was wasted and there's no coming back from these choices in a potential season 2. I'll be waiting for the next season of Kingdom.4/10.",4
East Asia,"What happens if you mix five doses of bullying, a handful of obnoxious school kids, one bad script+directing combo, bake it only halfway, and sprinkle some very light horror on top of it? You get a poorly made south-korean ""pop hit"" with overinflated reviews. I realize that south-korean drama has a different formula, a different flair to it, when compared to other countries' , but this just feels like Korean Bollywood. Sometimes, it feels like a Japanese advert director was giving ""pro tips"" off-camera.",2
East Asia,"I had little expectation when I began streaming this show but am very pleased with it. It's about teenagers and there's campiness involved along with the drama. Very tongue in cheek which makes it a nice reprieve from all the over-the-top zombie action. Good character development, excellent dubbing, good storyline. Although the scene of the Captain's escape and swimming away amidst a crazy barrage of bullets with only one bullet barely grazing him made me laugh... that's why you can't take this so seriously. I also love the references to Train to Busan (which is one of the best zombie movies out there). This is very entertaining and worthwhile if you like this genre.",8
East Asia,I've been watching zombie movies for 30 years. I have watched or attempted to watch every movie or show containing zombies.This one is definitely the worst. It's pointless and ridiculous nonsense. I could only watch the first episode and less than ten minutes of the second one.This show is bad beyond compare.,1
East Asia,"This is a great zombie show, the inconsistencies some have complained about between the zombies is explained later as they state the virus is constantly changing and that's why there can be no cure.My biggest issue with this show is that on multiple occasions they use the typical annoying Hollywood scenarios where some character makes a dumb choice and screws things up for everyone.Also it's incredibly hard to watch scenarios like the kid on the roof who decided not to help at all when the rescue chopper comes.Could have been better no doubt, hopefully they'll improve for season 2.",8
East Asia,"With any zombie movie or drama, you accept the basic premise of a fictious life form that does things that are unreal. However, it does get frustrating when the show is filled with unrealistic human behavior. The zombie outbreak at the school starts with a girl opening a cage that was rattling. I had a sense of deja vu since another zombie show, Kingdom, had two people fighting to the death, but stopping suddenly to open a rattling crate, which let out the... zombie... Are there that many people in this world who cannot resist opening something that rattles? Please, please... If you hear suspicious rattling from a box or crate, call the authorities or move away from it. Do NOT open the damn box!!!",5
East Asia,"Very entertaining, the cinematography is pretty good and there were a lot of nice shots
The plot is very interesting, for once the main characters are not adults but young students so it was nice seeing a different point of view.Amazing the relationship between the characters, even if it is a series about survival and zombies it goes deep in the emotions of the characters, hope they'll make a second season cause I'd like to see more of them.",8
East Asia,Sooo[ooooooobad. Please dont WASTE YOUR TIME LIKE I WASTED MINE. IT. IS. SO. BAD!!! Every charaxter is mega stupid. Most of the scenes were very awkward and clicheic. I think it is one of the worst tv series that i have watched in my entire life.,1
East Asia,"I was looking forward to this as I am a huge fan of Korean zombie movies. Was very disappointed watching this.If you're looking for a movie with action, well thought out storyline and good character development this is not the show for you. If you are looking for a show about teenage angst and random plotlines that lead to nothing this is the show for you.I would only watch this if there was absolutely nothing else left on your list to watch.",2
East Asia,"I don't know, I simply enjoyed it. I liked the teenage drama feel combined with gore and survival. Although I feel like there were too many unnecessary deaths, everyone was always sacraficing themselves, it was starting to get annoying.I hope we get a season 2 and a proper storyline for the ""half zombies""ps Cheong-san deserved better!",8
East Asia,"At a time where the zombie apocalypse scenarios seems already saturated and overdone, there comes a show that breathes some new life (ironic, I know) into the genre.All of Us Are Dead is an extremely well-made show that nails pretty much everything it sets out to do. The action is almost constante and relentless, but they still find time to work some effective and really well written drama, excellent characters and even some goofy comedy scenes.There's a lot to love here, but I think what really makes this show works is the characters. In a similar vein to Stranger Things' first season, they managed to create some really compelling and emotionally engaged cast of characters. The teenagers are not unsufferable assholes like in most shows, instead they feel like real people, with real issues and strenghts, and you really want to see them succeed and escape.It's one of those shows merely talking about it doesn't really does it justice. It can even sound kind of dumb in paper, but once you see it action on the screen, you get mesmerized. The people behind this show really pulled off some bold and creative ideas that many other would've easily screw up.Especial credits must be given to the young cast of actors, who not only have stellar dramatic performance, but also some incredibly physical stunt work and zombie sequences.The only downsides I can think of are some (very) minor plot holes and the fact that the show does get a little tiny bit repectitive. Other than that, this is a must watch, especially for genre fans.",8
East Asia,"Mostly dragging on to much, with wooden acting and just laughable dialogue. Its pretty boring most of the time, with hilarious scenes in which main characters dodge dozens of zombies in narrow corridors becaus plot armor. Emotional impact missing, some deaths just random and some ... lets say weird superpowers. If one had started to fly at the end, I would not hav been surprised.Made it to episode 6 before checking out.It is well crafted in some regards, hence a 6 out of 10. But you won't miss out much if you don't watch it.",6
East Asia,"Not sure how this got 7.7.It's not ""that bad"" but it's also not very good either. Everything gets very repetitive and/or very ridiculous VERY quickly, and this is someone that stuck with the dumpster fire TWD until the end.This review is totally ignoring how the writers chose at PURE WILL to FIT THEIR MEDIOCRE scripts just how long it takes to turn into a zombie after being bitten. 5 seconds? Yeah sure, if it fits the script. 5 minutes? Yeah sure, if it fits the script and the person bitten needs to give an emotional goodbye,Not a terrible show, not a very good one either.",5
East Asia,"The dialogue gets a lot of criticism, but as a teacher in S. K. it's on par with the speak. Their interactions, barring the two psychos, is everyday here. The only criticism I have is to the episodes. Episode 11 was the perfect send off for the show - dark, mysterious and ambiguous. They pushed forward and made a twelfth which not only had a different, child like tone; where all dread, fear and the doom had been replaced by joyful wonder. The first 11 episodes took place in a 3 day run. I know that childhood conditioning is rife here and that'd take some time to overcome or break free from, but the 12th episode is 3 months later. These children who've experienced the darkest situations should no longer approach life like children.Let's just say...if you watch till the end you can expect disappointment.",9
East Asia,"Slow, bad acting, boring, unexplained things happen and bad writing and redacting.Instead of enjoying the series, you end up with a super bad day and angry because of that.",1
East Asia,"It's about 12 hrs long but never let us felt that, very engaging. The cinematography is outstanding whenever there's a chasing sequence, my god it's feels so good, the camera angle. The little love story is good. Hope makers will release it's part 2 very soon.",10
East Asia,"I liked the series. Especially viewing how Korean kids typically behave in their normal environment.As to the zombies, they are pretty standard and the kids make the same moves as in most zombie flicks. Ex: staring for seconds too long before reacting, then jumping in to sacrifice themselves, etc Basically, what kids would likely NOT do.But I still enjoyed it immensely. It's a fast paced energy thrill ride.",8
East Asia,"The series has a good idea, it has a nice photograph but it fails to prolong characters like the villain of the series in addition to completely silly and dumb characters.",5
East Asia,"The moral of this story? Good guys (people) finish last.I love zombie flicks and South Korea made one of my all-time favorites: you guessed it... Train to Busan. But here they've taken an ENDLESS amount of time with character development, but why? To get us to like the characters so that it stings even worse when they kill them off? Yeah, I know lots of dead characters is to be expected, but they spend 11-ish hours on character development and it just feels like they're torturing us.I'm almost done with the series. I watched it all because currently there was nothing else on Netflix any better. But I didn't enjoy it as much as I wanted to.",6
East Asia,"This's the slowest series I've ever seen in my whole like, even if this series was 4 episodes long it will still be a waste of time. I swear I completed the whole series in 2 hours by just skipping most of the scenes, btw I regret wasting these 2 hours.",2
East Asia,"Kinda seems like they borrowed from the anime heavily and just toned down innuendo. On its own merits and typical of Korean zombie films, character development is darn good. I cared about them. Some of the slang and moments of emotion will miss the mark on American audiences. Cultural differences I suppose.I would definitely watch a 2nd season to see how things move forward. Pacing was good after the second episode. It's entertaining and at times campy but I liked it.",8
East Asia,"The action of the zombies in this show is very realistic. It is interesting to watch the relationship between friends. Well executed until the middle of the series. From the ridiculous lines, to the moronic ""decisions"" to the horrible way they treated some characters. The typical Netflix-style ending was a bit disappointing, but I really enjoyed this show.",8
East Asia,"A series which is scary , emotional , and love story .A perfect combination!You will definitely connect with the characters .Good cinematography .Best camera anglesBest visual effectsBest camera qualityStoryline is bestEverything is goodYou should watch this series .",10
East Asia,"For a group of high school students who actually figured out its a zombie apocalypse like train to busan from the first episode, their IQ and repeated behavior in the next episodes can make anyone with common sense cringe .Still if u like some gore, action and little humor here and there yeah give it a shot.",5
East Asia,"Koreans have been making some pretty decent stuff lately, biggest example squid games. Last few years they been making some great stuff. This year they already came out with 2 different shows including this one im writting about. This was pretty well done, had some flaws with it that is considered tv show mistakes. Had lots of things I remember thinking why can't he do it but she can? So some flaws they did not see but other then that had decent story pretty good characters not huge development on them but still had some, id consider this show more action but was still really good and always kept my attention. Im really bad at reviews and writting in general so I hope people really looking for an awnser can understand what I was trying to say ( if not clear)",7
East Asia,"The unique thing about this series is, I think the first time ever happen since I watched the first zombie movie is it happen in the world where everyone know about zombie from movie. Its not like The Walking Dead where they dont call them zombie because in their world, zombie never exist, not even in movie. But, in this korean series, they call them ""zombie"" from the beginning. Sacrifice and responsibility plays a big role in this series, when people live in desperation, they never left their side of humanity. That's what make this series fun. Its a fun zombie movie with a lot of action and cliche from all zombie movie in history. Have fun.",7
East Asia,"I'm on episode 6 and I'm hooked because of the drama with strong sociopolitical messages, not because of the zombies.And Yes...it's long, but who cares? Why you want it to finish it so fast? Take a chill pill and be grateful it's as long as it is good too.Also, for the animals that complain about having filler, guess what?, fillers are intended for character development and world-building support.",9
East Asia,"The storyline is ok, it points out bullying, cruelty of humans, but some of characters are just too stupid.They just stand there, not reacting every time there is an attack, especially the girls.Only the girl with an arrow knows how to kill the zombies, the rest just carry useless weapons like long sticks, and the annoying thing is most of them don't use it to aim the head (come on it's a zombie ??)-Useless death for some characters to make it more dramatic and sad.Poor decisions of characters that make you annoyed to death.",5
East Asia,"I am 22 years old. I grew up with Dawn of the Dead, and I must say, this show is far better. It's like taking a bland dish and adding the right spices to it to make an even better dish; sorry DOTD fans, I still love DOTD, but it's no longer my favorite apocalypse film; it will go down in history as the best of it's time.I am a huge fan of the Beastars. Just an FYI, I know that this film takes place in Korea while the Beastars Netflix Series takes place in Japan, but the High School setting; the mystery theme of who or what is behind a killing, the character's voices/mannerisms and even their uniform remind me of the Beastars; the hero dude Cheogsan who has a secret crush on Onjo reminds me of Legoshi and Haru for instance.This is hands down the BEST zombie-apocalypse movie-series of all time. I call it a movie series because the episodes are like movie segments, that really don't feel like they're a hour long. It's absolutely hilarious too. I've so far watched 3 episodes. I would hate to spoil it for those who want to see a Sci-Fi masterpiece that still managed to be original. The character arcs are gripping, and you grow an attachment to the main characters really quickly.Since it's full of gore, I'd say it's best fit for ages 17 and up.In many ways, the zombie-virus reminds me of COVID, but is way worse than covid; Contagion's virus was eerily just like coronavirus too, but again not as terrifying as the one on this show. Made me think, ""Maybe Covid isn't so bad,"" and the importance of our modern-day technology!The animation is intense, so-much-so that you forget this is just a movie. If you watch it long enough, you actually start to feel there; the makeup and animation is simply so compelling. Immediately, when you begin to watch it, you're HOOKED. You'll feel empathy, fear, suspense, and amusement AT ONCE. Every single character on here is interesting and talented; both the actors on the screen, and the voice-over actors; you can't even tell that it's a voice over, and I really had to study their lip movements, which still seem to be in sync; you seriously WON'T notice it very much at all.You'll be determined to see what happens to all of them, and if they make it out because the title itself just draws people in. It is brilliant. Every single shot and angle is perfectly paced in line with the story. I never feel like characters stall or are dragging the time, like I've seen with even some Disney+ Originals; move aside Disney and take some notes, because Netflix Originals did it AGAIN with another masterpiece.It is bound to jerk some tears of sadness or shock, or make you cry laughing. You seriously can't get bored with this one - even I can't and I am attention-deficient. This is definitely binge-watchable if you can stomach the realisticness of the gore and suspense. Sometimes I even forgot that the characters can't hear me through the screen when they're unbeknowst of a zombie's approaching. I can see why this made the top 10, but this baby could go in a top 3 tier list. I have yet to find something that comes as close to it!",10
East Asia,"I'll keep it short, the film is action-packed and thrilling - minus the first episode. So you really have to live through the pilot where the writers basically wanted the viewers to get a sense of the show's mood. Honestly, it felt a little unnecessary... Nevertheless, the succeeding episodes were heart-pumping. I didn't want to stop watching at 3 am.Anyway, the problem is not if it lives up to Train to Busan, because of course it won't. Different setting, tone and character focus. But the issue is how the writers only make characters likeable the moment they're about to cut them off.Believe me, I love an emotional character death but to kill of the interesting ones that the audience root for at such an early stage is just annoying. At least semi-develop the other nobodies before killing the charming ones. Other than that, the show's pretty good.I have to comment the casting too. I don't know Korea's standards but WOW everyone's so good. Even the random child saved by the police had great acting skills. So yeah, that made the experience more terrifying.Hoping for season 2. ???? Give me someone to root for from episode 1 to... at least episode 5-6.",7
East Asia,"This is one of best zombie series I have ever seen, I love the South Korean take on the zombie genre. Extremely well done makeup and special effects and refreshingly unique story line.",9
East Asia,"A teacher who would rather save a psychotic murderous student than 7-8 normal kids who clearly need adult supervision and guidance.A mother who runs into a zombie apocalypse, and starts calling out zombies and then gets killed basically achieving nothingA so called bright student who clearly notices a fellow student infect a kind poor kid, but does nothing to stop it, waits for the kid to get infected and die, and then calls out the psycho as if she did anyone any favor.Characters who are so shocked all the time, they won't even move when a zombie horde is coming at themBasically if you can think of all the idiotic decisions someone can take during a zombie apocalypse, they are all taken here.The writers use cheap emotional tricks to get you invested. If your characters exist only to take stupid decisions so that you can create manufacturered drama instead of organic ones, you failed as a writer.May be some like that, but i personally hate this show.",1
East Asia,"Stupid, incomprehensible. Addictive. Guilty pleasure.The characters are incomprehensible , unsympathetic and weepy. The action is nice. Nonetheless i couldn't stop to watch it, like a bad accident you can not look away.",3
East Asia,"Budget looks good to make a well zombie tv season but what lacks is the direction and story telling! No focus on a single character and the character which they focus on are useless and get executed, giving a useless story telling and screenplay. Didn't feel any adrenaline rush or scare. No powerful character, gets boring in between. Expected more from this high budget Netflix series and Korean drama.",1
East Asia,"The plot is so fake like one moment they are just students and the second later they become super ninja letal killer
Also the characters are all so stereotyped is annoying!",1
East Asia,This is definitely an amazing fun flick. So many good things and the direction is good. Characters are so good with acting and body language. Nice gore and bloody zombies. Good makeup and sweetly satisfying show.,8
East Asia,"The one thing that makes me rate this show higher than most zombie shows, is the lack of stupidity needed to advance the plot.Sure, teenagers in a high stress situation make mistakes, but realistic and understandable ones.The higher ups have some hard decisions to make and are realistically conflicted about it.Even the highschool drama makes sense to me.",8
East Asia,This is patchy but intriguing. It has some of the most horrific Zombie moments without having to go full Walking Dead gore fest. For the me most interesting aspects were the traditional Korean cultural values (especially family) juxtaposed to what we see in western versions of this genre. My hero was the commander - his medical protocol Vs family (in the age of COVID) was a better take than shows like Contagion.,8
East Asia,This is one of the best web series. In starting 1st and 2nd episode was lil boring but it makes your interest in series and after that you connect with the characters and it's one of the best experience. This series was tooooo good.,10
East Asia,"I was deeply impressed by the performance of South Korean zombie movie 'Train To Busan' in 2016. The acting of zombie was mind-blown to me. And I was looking forward to another thrilling and breath-taking survival story. However, in this case, the performance of the zombie actors is the only saving grace of this show, the illogical plot and acting of 'the living' have ruined this show entirely.There is one scene in ep2, 'the living' are running away from fierce zombie hordes. They barely make it to a classroom surrounded by glass windows. You heard me right, thin layers of glass window are the only thing between 'the living' and zombie hordes. And yet, they still can turn their back on horde of zombies outside the classroom, fall into an argument with one another for some meaningless, non-urgent issues that nobody cares. 'The living' are acting way too calm that not even a single one of them is having an eye on the zombies pounding on their windows and doors. It feels like they are living in a parallel world, and what is happening outside has nothing to do with them. It is unreasonable and far from what I anticipated.The performance of zombie actors is respectable, I can see they are putting a lot of effort on creating a sense of terror and thrilling, but that is about it. Even the terrifying zombie cannot save the terrible plots.",3
East Asia,"The Movies should be an example for real life, but this movie show a bad morality in each character on their movies. It's a shame, a movie like this should be able to set a good moral example for the audience.So many korean movies like this.",1
East Asia,"Im in a rush so ill be shortThe cinematic language of this series is all over the place. They enphazise moments with camera and script that end up being for nothing leaving a feeling of unfinishness... Also, most of the deaths are meaningless which would be nice if that was a premise, but its not. So most characters die without having their arch finished or even developed, like the girl who tried to bring food to the rooftop. The pacing of these deaths were also weird. Most of them had very little development or build up, which is normal for a secondary character, but why dies the mom go to the school just to die and then carry on with the series like nothing happened just to have Cheong-san find her in the lasts episode... like dont show me her death if there's no purpose (narratively speaking). Cuz the feelings, intentions and purpose of her deaths gets thrown away for the rest of the series just to have such a superficial aspect at the end. That can be said for most of the characters.And then when a truly important character dies theres nothing to say of them, they just die and end of story, even our protagonist dies without doing anything with the antagonists and we dont even see he's actual deaths... just boom: end.There's also many times where I felt they left something open for developement like weird zombies or the lantern, which only purpose (of the lantern) was for the daughter of the firefighter to find it later and have 3 seconds of her crying and then tell her father's partner he's dead in a very anticlimactic way...On the other hand it's pretty enterteining, won't elaborate the cons anymore actually since i see the review section full of people who point out the strong points of this drama.Either way i enjoyed it, the tensions was a bit too much for me in the first episodes so the tone got messed up when they suddenly introduce some comic relief after the first half... Like i needed that a long time ago instead of constant running, tension and hiding. Plus they could have gone other places too, the narrative doesn't even grasp that so its a pretty conscious decison, but the screen writer could have thought of exploring more other characters, backgrounds and places... perhaps the protagonists could have escaped a lot sooner cuz, for me, it got to a point where i was like ok... they're trapped again... brilliant... more of the sameI insist, I enjoyed it, it was enterteining even if i just focused on the negative.PD: Sory for my horrible writting and meesy structure, im in a rush. :)",7
East Asia,"Very thrilling and emotional for me. If you lose everyone you love very truly, and still you are not able to do anything, this hurts very much. I think this webseries is for strong hearted people where lot of violence is present.",10
East Asia,"Really a most horrific,most entertaining and most humoric web series that i have ever seen. All actors works are brilliant and that is the reason this web series pre production work is very good. Also post production work are superb. So, it is really a suprb interesting and horrific webseries. Thank you.",10
East Asia,"Going into it i was really not sceptical as the series was 12 episodes (each episode having 45+ runtime), and the series does lag in the middle but at the end its a good series. Acting is not bad , zombies are part we seen before and part new things. Worth a watch go for it if you have time. After watching this i really miss the series named ' Sweet Home ' which i hope Netflix renews for a new season .",7
East Asia,"The vibe I got from the trailer was that of a censored version of The highschool of dead anime. However, its superior in every aspects. Even though the story has a major plot hole but the background score, cinematography and stunts completely filled those voids. The sense of story telling with the aspect of time is a major win for this series. But the prospect of a thick plot and dense character study looses all its volume with a hurried ending. I would not say that its a ""must watch"" but a ""good watch"" indeed.",7
East Asia,IT'S A FANTASTIC WEB SERIES AS I EXCEPT FROM KDRAMA ZOMBIE SERIES. THIS IS THE ONE OF THE BEST SERIES I EVER WATCH AND BEST IN ZOMBIE. I RECOMMEND YOU TO WATCH BUT IT'S EPISODES IS TO LONG CONSIST OF 12 EPISODES.,10
East Asia,"My expectation for the show was higher than what it turned out to be. The storyline was good, however, felt like it way too stretched that it should've been. The reason to create that virus that made the people zombie was that satisfactory. This shows the cruelty the victims face from the people they expect to aid them. The romance they tried to create in this show was not something appreciative at all. As the romance was not even a bit exciting all along the show. You can watch it if you have time it's a mid tier apocalyptic show.The ending was a cliffhanger and it was a nice exciting one hopefully they can bring out the next season and make it a good one. However, my expectations are not that high as I don't think there can be something more added to make the story better.",6
East Asia,"All of Us Are Dead is fine.But it is a conceptually very juvenile show. The whole origin of the epidemic is difficult to digest. This series has a certain bizarre tone, that tries to balance the drama, comedy and action-horror, but it doesn't always work. Or it won't work for everyone the same way.Having said this. I had fun. The various points of view on the zombie apocalypse are very well made. Action scenes are great. And the overall production value is pretty decent. There are several characters I liked, and I was sorry to see some of them being dismembered.Despite having some problems with the more childish elements of the narrative, this series, in general, provided me with good times.But it's definitely not as refined as Squid Game. Despite being very ambitious in its proposal.I rate this series 7.5 out of 10.",7
East Asia,"The show starts, in netflix-esque fashion, with a event that would never happen like that in a natural situation. This show boils down to overdrawn characters and teenagers being teenagers. Don't waste your time on this fine looking but poor written piece.",1
East Asia,"Honestly, everything is almost perfect but the reason I can't give two more star is when the character fall over and trip again a few times. Second is when certain character decided to sacrifice themselves in hope to help the other but it's just getting me pain. As example, when Cheong-san mother secretly arrived at the school, she called his son friend that already got bitten and I was shouting stoopid so loudly in front of my camera. Furthermore this drama drive me up the wall when Na-yeon murdered Cheong-san friend with a wipe of handkerchief that contain zombies blood and then all the hateful moments appears a lot and more to come. She is the cause of why the group created negative vibes and I hate it but I know every survival movies will always have that person. Anyway it's worth to watch it and I've just finished this drama in four days. VERY RECOMMENDED! *of course we are waiting for SEASON 2, IT MUST HAVE, because the ending keep me hanging and questioning.......",8
East Asia,"Good action, good zombie performance, but that's all. The real problem of the show is its logic, I will pick a few points to talk about but there's way more. 1. The firefighter fought all the way to the arsenal in the police station, but he only took one gun? Is it really that heavy to take more? More ironically, the only gun he had was taken by a weak man, and he did not even bother to take the gun back! 2. Every time things get a little emotional, the characters had to shout even there were lots of zombies around, its like they were afraid zombies don't know where they are. 3 What's the point of the sacrifice of the firefighter? Could he not throw one or two sticks far to draw away the zombies and then run out fast and then lock the door from outside, I think that's totally possible. 4 The girl had a wooden spike, she could have used it to kill dozens of zombies, but instead she waved it around like a normal stick, if you cant use it right, cant you give it to another man?",6
East Asia,"I must create new account to make a review for this.Again and again, why all zombie movies treat character as no-brainer ? I know that this is unreal world, but character is human, and human has brain to actually think ?What they do ? Shout out to invite zombie to come to them ? Lol, is this joke ?Let's try again, to make this genre better, at least treat character as normal human , is it possible ? Or zombie genre means human is not human after all ?",1
East Asia,Thank you so much for these masterpiece. I have seen Many zombie film or series but these series is another level. I enjoyed hole day watching these masterpiece.,10
East Asia,"I could not get past ep 4.I'm sure this is entertaining for the people who can turn off their brain and just enjoy but Im just not one of them.Be warned, some survivers make really stupid decisions, it was painful to watch. Hard to relate or root for the characters because of that.Be warned, some survivers will make some really really stupid decision that are quite painful to witness.",5
East Asia,"Very much disappointed from a Korean zombie series. Nothing interesting at all. Kingdom was the best zombie series till now, nothing match that level in any manner. Waste of time, if you missed it no big deal at all. If you have lots of time just watch it and Waste your precious time.",5
East Asia,The plot and direction are great!also there is some goofs on series!I don't think that it's necessary to kill most of the team in their way to home!i looking for the better ending but i discouraged in episode 11.Can't wait to watch the next season with better endings.,9
East Asia,The zombies are good. But honestly all of those kids should be dead within the first 5 minutes from their decision making. Everything else seemed unrealistic.,3
East Asia,"Exceptional! If you loved Train to Busan, you're going to like this one too. It might not be moving as fast as the movie since it's a series after all. But acting, storytelling etc. Have been executed well. And you cannot really predict what's going to happen in the next episode!",8
East Asia,"Actually I love the concept that director use as a high school student becoming a zombie I love the concept Love this series
Please renewed the series for season 2
This is the request form a fan.",10
East Asia,"As a full grown adult i have to say that this was major flop! My spouse was also complaining how slow, how unrealistic, how stupid behvior the teenagers had and again that how slow it was. 6 episode would have been much better. Also, the zombies movements and acting was way more better than any of the teenager actors/actresses. I have feelings that positive reviews are mainly from the teenagers who happen to be Korean movies& Zombie fans.",2
East Asia,"There's some really fun zombie action in here. The way they turn is violent and well-made, and camera and sound are great! That is about it though.The dialogue is mostly a cringe fest, the decisions the characters make are even too dumb for high schoolers and the story is slow and just really meh.There's also some attempts at humour, but those shots mostly miss, like 99% of the time.Can't recommend, except if you have absolutely nothing else to watch.",5
East Asia,Good story but they don't rally dragged it out. Chronic overuse of the people running and falling. I don't think Koreans are as inept at running as they portray. My gosh not one person could run without stumbling.,6
East Asia,"Having seen shows and movies like ""Goblin,"" ""Squid Game,"" ""Miracle in Cell Number 7,"" ""Train to Busan,"" ""The Flu,"" ""Love in the Moonlight,"" ""Kingdom"" and the Philippine made ""Block Z,"" I can definitely say that ""All of Us Are Dead"" is one of the most okay yet overhyped Korean series and Zombie flick on social media. Featuring storylines and premises done better in the movies and shows I have mentioned - like drama, romance and Zombies in a campus - the series is predictable and only adds one thing new: the ""Halfbies.""",7
East Asia,"Finnaly the zombie korean series involving high schooler is here. The plot of every episode is solid, not too slow and not too fast. The thriller chased by zombie is pump up my hearbeat.",9
East Asia,"I am a fan of zombies and Korean movie industry has built some good reputation in this matter. BUT this series may have pulled down the reputation because this series is so bad such that I wonder if it was directed by teenagers.Bad acting!Good thing is that the mystery got explained very soon in the second episode (if you can go that far).Those creepy/zombie scenes are totally predictable and common in a zombie-themed series/move so they can't be constituted as a reason to give applause to this series.Too many scenes are not logical at all. For instance when Onju was pressed against the floor by a infected male student, what should be expected is she simply can be bitten. But no, apparently she holds the fight and get away with the zombie. But wait! One second ago she is too terrified to move and next second she fights back the zombie.And the extinguisher can also defeat zombies?It just a tip of iceberg showing how bad this series.",5
East Asia,"As korean i was disappointed.The original webtoon is more great than it.All story is boring.And it is cliché lump
There are too many useless scene.I don't know why this drama is NETFLIX 1st.It is just for killing time.",7
East Asia,"Binge watched it in 2 days. I love the fact that it had mutations of the virus and kept me on the edge of my seat with some of the episode's cliffhangers.. I'm really annoyed that they didn't seem to even try to find food or water even after acknowledging that lack of water would kill them. However, I love how smart some of the characters were and some of the things they came up with to get from room to room.",9
East Asia,"This show is like The Walking Dead, but instead of 70% of the cast being totally uninteresting, useless, and annoying, 100% manages to live up to that lame standard. It reminds me of the rubbish programming that Netflix used to provide about five years ago. Back when people were canceling their memberships in mass.",2
East Asia,"It's an amazing series it's my personal favourite series
Perfect cast, perfect storyline with hint of friendship, perfect location, perfect concept
It's just perfect of all????",10
East Asia,"Good premises of a zombie apocalypse setup. Generally good acting but the whole coming-of-age mixed in really dragged down the show.It's zombie apocalypse we do not have time for young brats' love quarrel and other emotional stupidity. Many parts we fast-forwaded to skip the boring cheesy moment that are suppose to be emotional. They felt completely out of place. Lot of sub-plots were not done in enough details and felt like just fillers.And I meant it is a zombie apocalypse show we are not expecting it to be 100% realistic, but when you have the main casts happily chatting with each other after two-three days of no water and food, zombies suddenly chase flare for no reason, and certain roles took forever to fully turn into zombie after being bitten, you know something is wrong about the script.",5
East Asia,"Series named as adult drama but incidents happening from school. But teenages acted as matured adults. Faults are though; I feel some unnecessary feelings injected on the 2nd or 3rd episode of the series. 7 kids vs atleast 60 powerful zombies in a classroom with a barricade. Actress's dad entry is not satisfying. They skipped so fast. Incubation period varies from 2 seconds to 1 week... Why?Otherwise overall series is a good... Cinematography, casting and making of the series are one of the best in industry. I have just 7 questions suggestions about the series that is I mentioned above.",8
East Asia,"Great! Series! I love it! I finish this season in 2days because i excited what happen next episode
all I can say is make season 2 even better so that the ratings and good reviews of the viewers will increase even more.",9
East Asia,All of us are dead movie is not just k drama movie it is a horror and goosebumps movie. It will give you just goosebumps. I just loved this movie and I am now exited for season 2.,10
East Asia,"Half-baked story, good effects, bad realization.One logical fault follows by the next. I got annoyed too many times while watching the series. The series is very predictable. I was very disappointed.",5
East Asia,"While I do like this netflix series, there was a mistake on episode 12 wherein Wu-Jin is alive again after he died on episode 11. But they killed him again maybe because of this mistake.",8
East Asia,"I thought the zombie acting was very realistic, from the growling, to the walking on the floor like the exorcist, and their joints cracking. I loved that most of the kids that survived had a connection with a least another student aside from On-jos dad that ended up dying, that's what made it so emotional. That's the part of the story line that kept me watching. The only thing I disliked and I thought was like kind of dumb about this story, is the fact that this science teacher started a whole ass pandemic due to his son getting bullied ? I don't condemn that kind of behavior from anyone of course. And he needed to do something about it. However, creating a virus because of it, it's the dumbest most selfish thing I've ever heard.",7
East Asia,"This was a massively will done show, the stories were good the effects were nice and the goriness was what you'd expect from a good zombie show..
Watch it and enjoy..
Well done ??",9
East Asia,I fell in love with this series from the first time I saw its trailer. I liked it. South Korea is making a lot of progress in the film industry. Thank you for your good films from Iran.???????,10
East Asia,It's fun! The main characters were escaping throughout the series only to be trapped. At last they finally escape with losing some of their friends. A freaking YouTuber makes us laugh! Jae-ik and the man are a good comedic duo. Gwi-nam is a freaking character and also he keeps the series interesting. It will be great. Cheong-San's death brings up tears. Overall the best zombie series.,9
East Asia,"I fell in love with this movie from the 1st time watching the 1st episode. I got hook-up with the plot and finished this series within only 2 days. 9 episodes on the 1st day and 3 episodes the following day.Credit to all the hard work and the creative art presented in this series. I must say, exceptional acting, excellent directorship, great casting, cinematography, videography, deep script, editing, and the make-up artist are all incredibly appreciable.The storyline started to get intense from the beginning till the end. The crisis is presented in the form of the zombies caused by the Jonas virus.I love how they presented various characters of human beings when facing a crisis, and in this case, it is between life & death.Selfishness & selflessness are conveyed meticulously in every character. The human survival instinct influences human action, especially in the end, where the human-centric point of view decides to save humanity from extinction and sacrifices other beings as collateral damage.I love how every crucial message and critical learning are conveyed to the viewers. The issues with inequality treatment, bullies, minorities, politics, fear, bold, and proactive were included.I can't wait for the 2nd season to come. I did watch other zombie TV series, but none are this great after Train to Busan.",10
East Asia,"After getting impressed by Kingdom, I was excited to watch another zombie movie by South Korea and this time set in high school premises. I really loved it tbh.. I don't know why people are giving it lower ratings. It kept me hooked to my Tv all the time... so gripping. Also the zombie action and graphic scenes are amazing n seems real. The zombie makeup is quite good. Although it was really hard to see my favourite characters die. Things you don't expect happened in this series I highly recommend you guys to watch it.",10
East Asia,"Seeing this on Netflix trending list I expected something watchable, not some dumb zombie series in which every character behaves like a zombie even before they become one.",5
East Asia,"I am a fan of zombie movies and series... you name it and probably I have seen it... Korean zombie concept is always high impact fast moving ones and this one was no exception to ""Kingdom"" or ""Train to Busan.Having said that, this series doesn't deliver anything more than an average story. Originality of virus unclear, acting mediocre, ending typical. Tries to introduce some novel concept like ""intelligent zombie"" but could have been better.But still I gave 7/10 just because the plot was better executed than many other zombie series... a good one time watch probably. Notjing more.",7
East Asia,"I really enjoyed this series, some of the character arcs were really good amongst some one dimensional characters and this obviously helped. The reason for the start of the pandemic was well thought out and it gave a good start to the story. A few of the episodes probably weren't necessary and filled the series out longer than it probably should have been.If you like Zombies with a small touch of humour in places then check this out and don't take it too seriously, like most Zombie fodder it's best to not use your brain too much.",8
East Asia,I don't like how some of the students are so stupid. Less action as well. I like how Koreans make good and hyper zombies but when it comes to some parts of the script? Boring.,6
East Asia,"All of Us Are Dead doesn't disappoint if you (like me) like a zombie film/series. There's plenty of zombie action and lots of gore, it's a fun show.Just don't expect too much from it, it's a zombie series after all, it's not meant to be taken that seriously. I found it to be an entertaining watch - good cinematography, effects, acting and direction.It has its flaws, the biggest one for me being that there isn't really much of a narrative there, it's just a lot of ""oh no, there are zombies trying to get us, we must escape"" kind of thing, but I still liked it for what it was.If you like the genre then you'll probably enjoy it, if not, don't watch it.",7
East Asia,"Acting was sub par even for a teenage Korean series. The female lead has exactly one expression. All characters behave in the most irrational ways possible. The whole refugee camp arc has nothing to do with anything at all. The pace of the series was so slow and nonsensical that you can skip most of the boring, script-reading scenes.",4
East Asia,"From start to end, stupidity... Stupidity..... Stupidity.Senseless.Meaningless
Predictable
Overrated
Craze about Korean looks might have created buzz.",3
East Asia,Best zombie series. Korean zombie movies are the best..... Amazing series.. not feel bored in between n very interesting... I am waiting for season 2.,10
East Asia,"First things first, this series has insane amount of gore. So it's a warning, anyone who is sensitive or cannot tolerate gore should stay away from this series.When I finished 2 episodes of this series I thought, ""what is new? It's that usual zombie survival series that Korea produces every year"". I felt it was like ALIVE but set in a school rather than apartment. Moving further into the series I realized, it is not usual.Zombie survival series are always interesting no matter how old they become. Having watched so many zombie based films/series, I now find those snarling open mouthed zombies absolutely hilarious. Either they look disgusting or they look hilarious.However, what makes this series so different from the other zombie ones are these:-1. The fact that it deals with the mental state of the bullied school kids who get no help or comfort, like how Eu-Jin wishes the school burns down and everyone gets killed after her being bullied. This results in grave consequences later in this series watch out for that.2. The fact that the zombie virus is justified this time. Most of the time we get only a faint detail of the infection but this time, through the videos of the professor, we get to witness a lot of details about the virus.3. The fact that the makers have decided to introduce a new kind of zombie into the series which later turns into a grave danger for all.There are many more new elements in this series and that's a huge plus point for a genre that normally doesn't get much different treatment.Loopholes, quite a lot including some really illogical scenes that I could not help but scratch my head at those points and the fact that the series is unnecessarily stretched. Each episode is about more than an hour long (honestly, it is just 1 hr on average considering credits start playing with 5 mins left at end) and there are 12 episodes. You really feel the drag when the student gang talk and share their feelings amongst themselves on a rooftop and these were some parts I genuinely skipped.Overall, I think the makers did a good job by introducing new unique elements into this zombie series otherwise I was ready to bash up this series left and right had it been that usual zombie survival series that are available in millions on Netflix.",8
East Asia,The web series experience was very nice. It automatically connects to teenagers. All characters are revining in my mind. I was cried at last two episodes. Humbly requesting the Netflix to release season 2 as soon as possible. Please.,10
East Asia,"Now I loved TWD in the early seasons but after the departure of glen then Carl and the final straw Rick it became boring and soap opera so after seeing the trailer for all of us are dead I was intrigued into wether this could fill my zombie void and I'm glad to say it did,this series had some great new takes on the zombie virus and executed them well the story can become slow paced at times but the effects stunts and action is a joy to watch,12 1 hour episodes is a long stretch but I enjoyed most of it and shall look forward to season 2.",8
East Asia,"A lot of zombie stuff has been done and there's only so much creativity you can come up with if it's already been done. So, when someone comes up with a new show, it's intriguing because I'm curious to see what's different about this one. This show is your typical Zombie but story set in a high school. It's got something for everyone.The zombie parts of the show were done REALLY WELL. Acting, action choreography, sound design, cinematography - everything was top-notch. Then there's your typical high school story that was a hit/miss. There's commentary on the society & family values - this added depth to the plot.Overall - it's a decent show with a lot of thrills but with minor pacing issues here and there, think Marvel trying to insert random jokes just because they can. They work, but seem out of place. The show has 12 eps, so this is a decent commitment. Could have been 8 eps, maybe 9.If you go down this road, you'll leave satisfied/non-disappointed by the end. If you'll be mind blown or not, is up to your taste.",7
East Asia,"I love Zombie shows but was sceptic about this one as the reviews weren't impressive. I watched first episode, and it was okay , second became better and by the 3rd I was hooked. It was non stop action from there....literally non stop. I finished it in 3 days. Well done Korea as always!",10
East Asia,How can you rate one out of ten and state in your review that you only watched ten minutes?This is very well made with great acting and direction. It reminds me of the first season of Walking Dead for its edge of the seat action. Some nice twists on the whole zombie idea also. I can't wait for the next season.,9
East Asia,"Not sure what to make about the people giving this rave reviews. My guess is they're really young or just paid accounts. This series was very disappointing (as usual with Netflix). Poorly written, acted and execution. If you're looking for the next Squid Game this ain't it. Not by a wide mile. Trust me on this, skip this low budget trash.",2
East Asia,"I won't write too much about this drama. The acting is decent. The script is OK - if you're watching with English dub, and the direction and editing are worthy of note but, at the end of the day, this is just another example of a production attempting to instill the idea that humans are violent.Episode 4 spells it out, without trying to hide it.Humans are inherently bad, so life without a governing body is wrought with danger.Whatever happened to the idea - possibly born in the 60's, or earlier - that humanity is inherently good?There are only a very small minority who find satisfaction in causing harm to the rest. Most humans would rather love their neighbour, not hate.Good idea for a show, if you're not bored with zombies, but we should all long for the day when writers realise that the public are not idiots, who fall for the idea that every human has evil at heart. Or is this just an attempt to make every human evil, whether they intend to be or not?It isn't just Hollyweird trying this approach, apparently.Try harder, Korea. You may find social realism - i.e. Actual social realism - more rewarding for the audience.",7
East Asia,"At first i assumed that this was overhyped and going to be cheesy but i was pleasantly surprised. There are enough original takes in this series to make it worthwhile. I Just felt the end was a bit rushed and then stretched (you will know what i mean). After an episode or two i was addicted to it and had to keep myself from bingewatching it till the end. Half of the characters actually think rationally during this whole ordeal even the army people. I very much enjoyed that. I also liked that it wasnt American and thus no over the top macho BS. I think the story is finished but i do see some Angles which may justify a second season. Overall definitely worth watching even if you are not a fan of asian-export products like k-pop, manga and stuff like that.",8
East Asia,"Well, as a Netflix production, this is way better than this piece of garbage that is Squid Game, (probably because it is based on a webtoon, so they already had the origin material) but I would not call it best tv series of 2022!The characters lack a bit of personality and charisma, and there's unecessary teenage drama too. Most of the characters and events are predictable, there's no surprises.Still, it is a decent show to watch, but I had to fast forward lot of boring stuff.There are way better Korean TV series out there! (Taxi driver, Signal, Hapiness, Sweet Home, Strangers from Hell, Uncanny Counter, Mouse etc...)",6
East Asia,"Okay, so I started watching this series because me and my girlfriend kinda like zombie series.Korean is a weird language for us and the names are very hard to remember since (for me) they look all the same. I'm from The Netherlands. Me and my girlfriend didn't know who was who. It's difficult to explain but that made it very hard for us to follow the characters and their storyline. Also, the first scene was very strange and hard to watch. I hate bullying but this was from another level. Then I read Online that these kind of behaviour is kinda normal in Korea. That shocked us. Then girls were beaten by guys and raped. That just absolutely isn't fun to watch.I watched three episodes. It was very slow-paced, cruel and felt weird. Train to busan (a very good Korean Zombie movie) was a lot better because it was character driven and there were just a few characters who had easy names to remember.This flick felt like a very cruel and bad script. We both wouldn't recommend watching this. It's literally horrible.We just finished Lost (the series) which was TERRIFIC. One of the best shows we have ever seen. Then we tried this and Archive 81, and those were just plain boring and bad.We both don't recommend this series. Save your time and search for a better one (",2
East Asia,"If you are watching this show only for the gore (like some of the low ratings here), it is not for you.Yes, there are very bloody moments and somewhat unbelievable zombie sequences, but that is a mere fraction of what this show is aiming towards. Under the ""zombies"" and ""fighting"", there is excellent emotional tension and moral exploration. From the students to the officials, the implications of moral judgement are monumental to the progression of the plot. Within the inhumanness, the interactions of such characters entrance us into a somewhat first-hand view of their relationships, where the threats from the ""zombies"" are often side-lined. This led to a truly well rounded series. This is matched with a great musical score, good direction (mostly) and excellent performances all around.There are a few things I didn't like. Firstly, there are many scenes where it feels alot like a soap opera. Characters freeze up way too often, and such moments are quite cliche.Secondly, the girls in this episode, (except one) are extremely sterotypical, and to an extent, useless. Most of them just stand around and whine, sometimes even when the group is being attacked. They after running two steps, they can't get up, they sulk and cry instead of fighting back. I would like to see more women step up and become emotionally and physically strengthened.In general, All of Us Are Dead is a thrilling show that often side-lines the blood and gore of a traditional zombie show for a emotionally charged and humane primary plot. It is at times stereotypical and cliché, but it is an excellent binge-watch. I had an excellent time watching it, its topping the Netflix charts, and I would certainly recommend it.",8
East Asia,"Love these Korean zombies series fast paced great action what not to love about it . Why better than British zombie movies . I want more. Don't understand negative reviews , not to be taken to seriously delicious fun everything you want in zombie series ,prefer films myself but this one of the better series I have watched.",7
East Asia,This show is pretty awesome and well done.If you dont like teenagers in school this isnt for you.If you love everything zombies then you'll enjoy the heck out of this.It has lots of great zombie attacks and isnt dull.I hope there is as many seasons as the walking dead or at least a few more.,10
East Asia,"Was gonna give this a 9 but when the dad sacrificed himself for his daughter at the tennis court, I had had enough of the terrible writing of this show. There was no reason for that.",4
East Asia,"I'd love to give this series an 8 or more. It had potential. Unfortunately, nearly every decision the characters make is beyond stupid. They all deserve to die. And multiple people should be fired... director, producers, writers.",4
East Asia,"I don't get all the negative reviews. Entertaining zombie film with a touch of Korean comedy and Korean drama. Great acting from everyone. Don't read other reviews, watch and decide for yourself.",10
East Asia,"My favourite zombie series is Kingdom and train to Busan is far better than most western made zombie movies. Also Squid Game was very good, however, that does not mean that everything from Korea will be awesome and that we should like it just because of that.All of us are dead is not good not bad, it has some interesting scenes, yet it feels that it should not have been 12 episodes... same issue that the walking dead had when people would rave about how ""deep"" the characters were, when in reality they did just have a lot of unnecessary dialogue and filler content that do not give the characters anything.I found myself skipping through by the end.Oh yes and one of the bullies is overdone on how many times he comes back.. it just annoyed me by that point.It is meh in one word.",5
East Asia,"If you don't mind watching a bad drama talks between two who a horde of zombies are behind and they just need 5 seconds to escape and live but they wasted it on talking about romance while the zombies are waiting for them to finish.If you don't mind a horde of zombies biting someone from the back and when they turn, there's not a single bite spot or blood.If you don't mind watching everyone turn to zombie in 5 seconds except for the main cast they take an entire episode.If you don't mind a person who's seen 100+ zombie biting humans still ask a zombie who's biting someone ""hey stop it what are you doing"" then get scared when they get attacked.If you don't mind watching a total of 2 IQ divided by everyone including the zombies.Then, this show is too good to be true.. for you!",2
East Asia,"On-jo: Push me to edge, All my Friends are Dead. Push me to edge, All my Friends are Dead. Push me to edge, All my Friends are Dead.Probably the most infuriating show of this year so far. When I looked through this show, I was surprised that there's 12 episodes with 1 hour average runtime per episode. How can you make such a long show about zombies, one of the most saturated horror genres?Just as my suspicion, the first 4 episodes were utter rubbish. It added nothing new, just the zombies pandemic breaking out. At this point I was thinking: let's rewatch Kingdom or Busan rather than this. The only thing kept me forward was the unique way of how the pandemic started.Then episode 5 started, and the show picked up quickly with a new twist. It was very intense, chaotic, and unexpectedly funny. The characters were all hormonal kids, so they are bound to make stupid decisions amid a zombie attack. The twist was pretty good, and I think that it did enough to justify the existence of this show.Character-wise, some were just straight-up wasteful. The two most notable were Na Yeon and On-Jo's dad. Some characters were incredibly infuriating like Nam-ra. The rest were pretty straightforward.One thing that I have to point out. This show referenced Train to Busan, and made it clear that zombies movies exist in this universe. I think that it's supposed to be funny, but this really made the character decisions baffling. One kid pointed out this fact, but no one else seemed to be aware of this fact. The zombies acted pretty much exactly like in Busan and Peninsula. Couple of characters at one point killed zombies by stabbing the neck or head, but at another point had no clue how to kill a zombie. Like why don't they learn? It's an urgent situation, but they can't be that stupid.Overall, this show is filled with problems, but it still added something new and made most of the runtime intense and fun. 6.5/10.",6
East Asia,I just wanna say that This show is way better than other series .. I just loved it & can't for another season..we need season 2 as soon as possible ....,10
East Asia,"One of the best zombie series from Korea after kingdom...!!!! A must see ..!!!Awesome action sequences, suspense , gore , the scenes cherographed was too good , and the story was great...!!!",10
East Asia,"It was pretty decent alot of stuff though did make me mad like why is nobody, throwing anyone turning out the window? What was the whole point of that girl being pregnant, why did nobody do as they saw others do and stab each zombie in the face or neck. Why did the girl in pink just die and become a full zombie if she was bitten by the bully kid and same for the kid on white with the bowl cut and naamra whose a super zombie? They did all this running around but there was food and sodas in the closet and nobody touched on that just the candy bar and doing abunch of work to escape a room where they had food and water or sodas. Where was the brains to find a way into the room. Is Chaesun the one who liked Onjo actually dead? Too many plot holes while watching this.But this was a great zombie series and was executed right and had me wanting to watch more and more and i loved the thriller aspect of this and how many people actually died and only a few made it out.",8
East Asia,"The actors and crew excelled in all respects, the shooting and directing are wonderful, but what made me rate 8/10 is that some scenes were not necessary and serve the story, and the other aspect is that the music or the music effects are very weak in this work, it could have been presented in a better way as for the rest It is incredibly perfect. I do not like to see works of the type of the living dead, but I say that this work has taken this type of business to another level, and it is considered that the Korean works are very impressive recently.",8
East Asia,"Enjoyed the overall look, story, cinematography and actors. If you're a fan of zombie movies and series that might be right for you, but there are scenes, actions and parts of the series, which are completely pointless and lengthen the series itself to an unnecessary length.This series would have been fine with four to five episodes, but these twelve make it kind of boring and losing interest within its progress. Less is more.",5
East Asia,"Boring stuff and lame stories don't get better if you produce them in South Korea! Mix some Teenage highscool crap stories with a virus and let them all get zombies. Zzz! The story is told a thousand times the last 10 years in roundabout a 100 zombie series. Why stupid humans need another one? I am really sick and tired of Netflix. They are so predictable. Show one series out of South Korea, see that it is successful, buy a thousand lame series more from South-Korea and hope they get hyped the same way. Nope thats not how it goes!",1
East Asia,Masterpiece mind-blowing plz make season 2 best zombie series I dont have worlds to say mind blowing. Best zombie series in the world direction is awesome and acting is also great .,10
East Asia,"For me, the most interesting part of this show is how and why the virus was created.What baffles me is the utter ignorance from on how to deal with these zombies. Even the person who is behind the origin of the zombie seems somehow baffled on what to do...I mean, I think it is safe to assume that the kids who go to this high school have seen at least 1 or 2 movies / series about zombies. Especially since some of the kids refer to 'Train to Busan'.Yet somehow they seem incapable to do what is necessary: smash their heads (and as such their brains) to kill them... or poke a pole through the zombie-brains. The chairs and desks have legs, right? At some point they actually have a broomstick in their hands and still the obvious move somehow escapes them.I have to admit that I have only seen two and a half episodes so maybe at some point things will turn around.Also, if you notice that someone gets bitten, don't just stand around... throw that person out of the window. Don't start a debate on what to do... YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO, IT'S THE ZOMBIE APOCALYPS!Sorry for my rant, I just can't see past this very annoying aspect of the series. Maybe it's just and me and I haven't seen enough Zombie-series/movies to make an honest judgement. But COME ON!!!Last but not least, I don't know if we are supposed to feel any sympathy with the characters, but until now there's just not enough background information to feel sympathy towards any of the characters. I like Bare-Su though, at least he kicks some Zombie asses! (but also fails to see the obvious 'scramble their brains' soluytion).",4
East Asia,"Yes, some holes are there in plot but but.They are very very minimal.All the show was done with very good highdrama and action and complete realistic zombie series ever made in entire cinema world.Friendship, Honesty,Love, Survival, right to live was portrayed very well.10/10 rating was very less
i will give 1000/10 .The efforts they had made to make this series is very greatest.",10
East Asia,I am binge watching this for the second time in a week. Action and drama in a very good balance. Top performances by all young actors. Many interesting sub-plots that are somehow overshadowed by the main story arc: the survival of a bunch of classmates. The concept of how the virus started is brilliant and very relevant to a 2022 take on the zombie genre. The Battle Royale loyals are going to love this.,8
East Asia,Well made series....it is best zombies film/webseries till date...full of emotion ride and characters love...all characters are extraordinary...I mention one actor (who played Chong San) his acting was brillent . I am fan this chracter...but all cast are preety good....story are so fabulous ( zombies in school) ????,10
East Asia,"After watching only 4 episode don't think it's a common zombie film. It have action , romance, thriller and what not. Eagerly waiting for season 2. If season 2 doesn't release it will be a disappointing thing but this is sooo good that season 2 will be soon available.",10
East Asia,"The show doesn't pretend to be intellectual or sophisticated. It is straight up what a good classic zombie drama should be- packed with heart-thumbing action throughout, characters that one can relate to and despite being helm by a primarily a young cast of high school students, everyone delivered their roles really well, and some really emotional & heartbreaking moments towards the end.",10
East Asia,"Please someone make a zombie show where the characters aren't complete idiots that stare blankly at people getting attached, that don't run like new born baby giraffes and make stupid speeches. This is not a good show, they're all wimps, they take risks for stupid things, they fall on the ground and just lay there for someone to pick them up. Just fight and stop pushing zombies away and why is it taking so long for the dad to get to the school?",4
East Asia,"3 episodes in and I'm waiting to give a crap about any of these characters. None of them are likeable, or particularly smart or clever. The perfect show to watch while on your phone.",4
East Asia,"Zombie fans, All of Us are Dead does not disappoint.These aren't your slow moving dumb zombies. These are your 28 days later, World War Z infected with advanced rabies type of zombies. High adrenaline, fast moving and terrifying, this show still manages to spend time developing characters and plot.I appreciate the amount of time they take for the zombie infection to spread, addressing issues of democracy while attempting to contain it.Most zombie shows have the infection spread early on and fast, then we're smack dab in the zombie apocalypse.AUAD gives us the perspective of what's happening inside the zone vs outside the zone, with media influence and political strategy.At the same time, this show doesn't take itself too seriously. There are some funny moments, like hearted comedy, and lovable characters along with some villains. It even pokes fun of it's early on, bring up Train to Busan, as they try to figure out what's happening.I'm half way through this first season and I'd say it's a well written show, especially for zombies.",8
East Asia,"The first 3 episodes are really promising that I can't wait for more. Then the series goes downhill to the last episode. It became so cliche and lame. For instances; Nam Ra could have just screams run to them once she smelled zombies instead of detecting how many zombies were coming. Also, instead of running on the road, why wouldn't they just hide in an empty house? Moreover, they decided to fight the zombies with sticks and hammer? Okay Thor. And the mom is the dumbest by entering a field full with infected and called the obviously infected and get eaten. She deserved it. The father of the female lead went through a lot to find her daughter just to have a less than a minute scene with her. Also, there are too many self reflecting scenes among them. Honestly, we don't care. Last but not least, the director could've just utilized the halfbies (The bully and Nam Ra) characters more. It'd be a great ending if they both fighting for their own interest either for good and bad. Or maybe they could control all the zombies and use their ability to end the pandemic. The directors probably save the characters for the next series I hoped.",3
East Asia,"Just binged the and to be honest ,I loved it. A little slow in places with the guilty party being the romance side of things as mayhem and carnage was being carried out just a doors width apart,but I guess to inject sum humanity into the series these parts were justified. Overall it's what it says on the tin,well acted ,filmed well,the mass zombie assaults were extremely well done,all the extras were obviously having a ball.Great series ,I'd highly recommend this.",9
East Asia,"In the recent years Korean producers have been making good movies in the zombie sub-genre. Train to Busan, Netflix's Kingdom series etc and now: All of Us Are Dead. There are 2 points that I wanna raise here.First things first, the zombie-actors are simply marvellous! Look at those kids!!! I think some are really recruited from kindergartens and they have excellent performances comparable to many adult actors/actresses. Pound for pound these kids can overshadow kids in Walking Dead series. No bias, but Koreans are catching up.And secondly, it's the new concept. Precisely it's not exactly new or original, but it's rare in zom subgenre. Namely the ""asymptomatic"" zom. We've seen werewolves or vams or Hulk that can change form deliberately or casually or emotionally. But not always seen in zombies, yeah? I like this concept. Cool babe. It's makes the story much more intriguing. U never know the one sitting next to u is a norm or a zom.What's not that good then? Well, the mad science teacher. Yeah I know he has a very special background but, hey, look at him. He's not convincing at all. I don't mean he's a bad actor, but he's not that ""crazy scientist"" in all aspects. When I come to my senses I don't even believe he has sufficient resources to make any significant accomplishment in cellular biology projects. No no no, not even an compelling argument.As a conclusion, I love this series very much. Guys pls give it a shot. If u r a zom fan like me, ask your gal/guy to sleep first and then binge-watch it overnight. Worth your every minute ;)",8
East Asia,Overrated to be honest. The best zombie kdrama is still the original KINGDOM! Nothing new to see here ... for 2022 there is other drama that is worth to watch than this. Definitely a No and will not waste my time watching this.,1
East Asia,"This show is so overhyped, everything is poorly written from the characters to the plot. Compared to other amazing Asian shows such as Squid Game, Kingdom, Alice in the Borderland, etc, it's just so lackluster and stupid. A lot of things that happened in the show were so random like the pregnancy of that one student. So much potential wasted also, I was expecting the bullied Hambie to duel the Bully Hambie, and it was just so funny how Na-yeon got killed instantly, her character was so useless those few episodes she might as well have died with the teacher. It's cliche and super corny, the characters almost have no chemistry with each other, and the romance feels super forced. Main character is meh. Oh well, better not raise my expectations next time.",5
East Asia,"Enough said.I wanted to stop at ""said"" cause that sums it up but stupid imdb wont let me...oh well...here we go...Seen every horror flick there is out there...not zombies though...they move slower than my grandma .. I mean...wheres the fun there...However,I m in 6 episodes and loving this. Be patient at first..it really builds up...and worth watching due to all other social issues it raises (bullying)Maybe I m wayyy too old(46)but really this is what bullying is like nowadays? I dont wanna send my son to school after watching this...and not because of the zombies...Enough said...give it a try.",8
East Asia,"What a thrilling ride!! Literally keeps you on edge of your seat!!! Don't go with nagative reviews. I don't know what they expect from zombie movies/series!Really liked character development throughout the episodes. Plot is amazing! Enjoyed those comic parts, and thank god they mept these comic scenes becase at some points everything gets so intense that my breathing just stopped, but thanks to those funny scenes that gave some relaxation!",9
East Asia,"Best series of 2022. All of the characters is very Amazing, Specialy Class President ??????, Love form Pakistan to my South Korean Brothers, keep it up, & I m Now Still Waiting for the Season 2.",10
East Asia,Let the bullies be the heroes. Let everyones reactions be strange. Let's not establish any character development. Well that pretty much sums this series up.,1
East Asia,"If you are in a zombie-infested school, survival should be your top priority but not these kids. It would be understandable if the premise of the story is that they are unaware that zombies exist but these kids have sited a famous zombie Korean movie in their script so that would not be the case. After that line, all of the scene just don't make sense anymore. I mean only four people thought of protecting their bodies when going out? Even their concerns and problems are not pertaining to survival but on foolish dilemmas like going to the bathroom hygienically and ending up in a worse possible solution? Hoping it would make things lighter and funny. But honestly It just grossing me out! Who wrote that!? Thinking about food and water supplies for these kids could have been better right? Even the government's concern and decision in this series just don't make sense. Like really?? Maybe the writers can learn from ""Lost in Space"" or ""#Alive"".",1
East Asia,"This show is amazing. They bring a fresh take on the zombie genre with notes on innocent love, true friendships, and hardships that are honestly heartbreaking at times. It's well rounded and disappointing at times but it's so incredibly worth watching. I rated the show a 9/10 because I am so disappointed at who loses their lives. There's so many characters you fall in love with only to lose them. There could have been at least one off limits!",9
East Asia,"That's right. If you're a teenager or have a teenager IQ for movies. This ones for you and most movies out there.Disappointing but didn't expect too much. Dialogue is simple. Yes the culture is diff than America or Europe but story is relatable. Some really terrible emotional scenes for characters that are almost adults. It's really a waste of time after the 3rd episode. I wasted my time cuz I was in a snowpocalypse for 2 days. It's a very frustrating to watch, characters are dull, slow at times and plenty of rip off zombie scenes.",3
East Asia,"This is a good show but it had me frustrated a couple of times. I think it has a lot of cool action and chase scenes. Su-Hyeon pulling off some martial arts moves never gets old, neither Cheong-san running through dozens of zombies. The setting is very cool. The acting, the characters being high school students and acting like one were some other strong points about it. But I couldn't help but get disappointed near the last 3 episodes.Well unlike another Korean zombie flick, Train to Busan (which isn't a perfect movie either), most characters do not really develop themselves. Apart from the class president making friends with others and being a nicer person (thanks to On-jo and Su-Hyeong) I didn't notice any major changes. Again, there was a lot of tear-jerking moments as it is in Train to Busan, but they take too much screen time. On top of that, some of these sad scenes are focused on very insignificant/less known about characters which makes it a hundred times more boring to watch through. Nevertheless it is a decent show and I can't bring myself to not like it. Seven out of ten, could have been much better without the drawn out tear-jerking.",7
East Asia,"I have seen enough of this, from Train to Busan, Kingdom, and now this. Same scenery where there is Zombie rampage, massive zombies chasing
Human by running away for their lives...after the second episode, I stopped watching it.",3
East Asia,"I really enjoyed this, and whilst it was obviously about a Zombie outbreak it felt much, much more, with characters I actually cared about.Some comments have said it's just the same as all other S Korean zombie films. Perhaps. But the physicality and action within the school were still ten times better than some of the stuff churned out in the US or Europe.It didn't shirk away from violence and wasn't afraid to kill off key characters - although you could argue it was a bit too keen at times. Maybe some of the side stories didn't really go anywhere, but they at least broke up the main focus so it didn't become too claustrophobic in one location, and even then you felt the whole of the school was utilised to give it a sense of scale.Things I liked:Good charactersGood set pieces and effectsGenuine interest in where the story was goingMain quibbles:The origin story of the virus was a bit ridiculousIs it realistic that the infected would just stay within that specific area and it wouldn't spread further?Apart from the school why are there never zombie children in the streets? (Something in all films to be fair)Probably could have been trimmed down to 10 episodes max.Overall, I thought this was just as good as Squid Game and, in some instances, better.",8
East Asia,"It starts of great. Its entertaining and I like how its pragmatic about the survival of a zombie apocalypse. The characters start a bit flat, but then develops, which is pretty cool. But now I am at episode 8 and more than 8 hours of watching the show, I am TIRED of countless unnecessary cliffhangers and extention of details in many of the scenes. We don't have to spend 10 minutes watching every main character talking into a camera greeting their parents and so on.And in my opinion, some details of the plot is just stupid, and it's very clear that it has been made this way to make it possible to extend the season to the max. This story could have been told in 10 episodes and i feel like im wasting my time.If you decide to begin watching this show, be prepared to be annoyed.",4
East Asia,"I'm halfway through episode 2 and over it. I enjoy a good zombie movie, but I'm tired of watching the same boring tropes. I was really hoping this could be different, but alas, it's all the same. Good production value can't overcome horrible scriptwriting, plot holes, and annoying characters. I'm sure this is a teenager's wet dream, but I can already feel my brain cells screaming in agony.What's with the bone cracking?? The inconsistent turn rates? There are students running around outside, yet no one thinks to run out of the school gates? We watch one short scene with the principal and that's it... wtf happened to the staff? Does this school not own an office with phones? Don't the classrooms have phones?? Where are the police? In the ""real world,"" rational people are fighting to survive- not mooning over their crush, calling each other ""c*$ksucker"" (that gem came from a teacher to a student), or standing around wondering HOW to kill these things when ""Train to Busan"" is clearly referenced several times.I literally cannot fathom sitting through 10 more hours of this, especially if the origin story is of Dad of the Year injecting his bullied son with a homemade recipe for revenge. What a disappointment- for once I'd love to see a total overhaul of the genre. I'm reminded of how I felt seeing the Matrix back in 99... it was new and exciting. I havent watched ""Train to Busan"" yet, but hope that it will restore some faith in zombies again.",3
East Asia,Neeeeeeeddddd kooooo ng season 2 at BUHAYIN SI CHEONG SAN plsssa sana mag ka season 2 para mabuhay si cheong san KASE SABE NI NAM_RA THERE BACK SO ITS MEANS NA BAKA SI CHEONG SAN YON AT MAY KASAMA PA SYANG IBA.,10
East Asia,"The series wasn't toooo bad but it could've been done in eight parts instead of twelve. At the midpoint it started dragging on way too much first with the group assembling in the choir room lamenting and arguing, then the roof for two episodes, lamenting and arguing, then we got a little action as they moved from the roof to the closet in the gym, and we had to spend time with them crying, lamenting and arguing some more for an episode and a half. Looord snooze fest. As diverse and fleshed out as the main characters were they weren't all that likable or interesting. I loved when they shared a candy bar in the closet as if they hadn't eaten in weeks when only 24 hours had gone by since the infection started.Then the one antagonist kept getting pushed out windows and pushed off the roof and then he kept coming back so that plot point got a little stale. I think if I had zombie superpowers the last thing I would care about is my missing eye and getting revenge for it. After all, his body was crunched, twisted, bit, smashed, mashed... he looked like hell so why was he worried about his eye for?I think this would've been a lot better if they had only trimmed the melodramatic repetitive fat and kept it to six episodes.Anywho...",6
East Asia,This series show us all emotions of love hate jealousy and still focus on its main plot zombies .... 12 ep 1 hour of each I binge watched it finsh it in single go for 12 hour continous ... the character of each of mai cast connectsand other thing is that the story from the scratch give you different feel .I am eagerly waiting for season 2.,10
East Asia,"I was looking forward to it because it was the original webtoon, but I could feel the zombie costume and the actors' zombie acting was full of tension and fun. I often saw that part because it seems like it was directed by replacing too sensational content such as rape and peeling with school violence. I think the camera's feeling and filter at that time became more immersive!!",10
East Asia,"Talking about the positives the series has good characters, story, suspence and a new type of zombies that can be called as half zombies. The show is suspenseful from beginning to the end and won't really bore you cause there are many interesting events that happen in each episode that makes you wanna watch the next episode. However the show is quite repetitive in terms of the zombie encounters and the way they deal with the zombies sometimes is both senseless and impractical. Also the show uses quite a few ""fake"" Encounters and incidents to lure the audience to the next episode. The climax of the show is good but it leaves a lot of questions that needs to be answered but at the same time it seems unnecessary to make another season just to answer those questions cause those questions aren't that interesting to make people wanna watch another season. Overall it's a good way to pass your free time.",7
East Asia,"Some pf the places in the scnerio there was problems but its still a very good Zombie scnerio. First of all they dont know how to seperate human/zombie mix.. but it is easy. They are very sensitive with sound, they dont eat normal food, they heal in couple of hours.Some of the bite scenes easily can stop but others were just waithing around. Korean's did again very good job. I love the show. I finished all the episodes in one breath. Reactions were very real, their human needs were very real. Very nice details. Perfect.",10
East Asia,"Well I wanted to watch this drama because people seem to be really like this. It was okay for first episodes but...WHAT IS THAT? Theare very absurdly designed. I was happy when I saw some of the zombies are different from eachother. But what's the point if you don't use it perfectly? The group has a girl zombie/human on their side but they don't use it for their good. For example, they saw the ""bully"" zombie/human can go anywhere and zombies don't make something to him. Then, THEN WHY THE MEMBER OF GROUP SACRIFACE THEMSELVES INSTEAD OF GIRL ZOMBIE/HUMAN? Just tell her ""go away and make noise while we escape.""
And why the girl in the pink dress survive first in that room and eat/drink what her want, and we saw that she wanted to help and then she died soon after. Why didn't you kill her when she went away with teacher?I can't understand. My English is dead. Lol.",3
East Asia,Relation between Korean Series & Zombies are always great.. Love to watch this show. I've completed almost 50% of episodes. And this is very awesome ?? I like it... Koreans really know how to make movies & series with a lot of emotions... Want more content like this ??,10
East Asia,"If you're a fan of zombie genre then you would find it to be better than most of the existing Zombie based TV series/movies but the concept is predictable. There are few loopholes that are visible to the naked eye but still the production value makes up to it. Some of the characters are too shallow and they could've trimmed it to 10 episodes as 12 episodes felt a bit lengthy. Other than that, it's worth a watch.",7
East Asia,I can't begin to praise this superbly entertaining zombie thriller enough. The direction is superb clear even though lots is going on. Some of the scenes are truly memorable and epic. There is such a variety of scenarios and action sequences that it is exciting throughout. The stunt work is seamless so that it looks like the actors are doing them. Some epic scenes feel like a big budget movie.The show doesn't fall short in the more intimate quiet scenes either. Characters both heroes and villains are involving and sympathetic and the relationships are interesting enough. The emotional scenes are good too - not overwrought but moving enough when a character you like gets bitten.Cast members do a good job. The older cast has some familiar faces especially if you have seen the excellent but different pandemic show Happiness. The young cast isn't very famous and that's good since you don't associate them with other roles that much.The 12 episodes just sped by. Of the recent worldwide topping Netflix shows I enjoyed this more than Hellbound and Squid Game.,10
East Asia,"Over all I believe it's a well done series.One thing I did notice that was completely wrong was the students debating the meaning of the distress signal S-O-S. They are debating this in the episode where they're on the school roof top. The female student who's father was an EMT says that SOS doesn't mean anything, that it's not an acronym. It does in fact stand for SAVE OUR SHIP.Not sure the writers can get more than one series out of this. Just my opinion.",7
East Asia,"#AllOfUsAreDead Good Story Line Interesting Truns On Story A Diiferent Zombie Show. I Love It To Watch Again And The All Charecters In This Tv Show Is So Good. Zombie, Love, Friends, Emotional Pain Good You Have To Watch It 1 Time In Your Life.",9
East Asia,"I saw the trailer and was like ""It'll be ok"" cos I like the zombie genre and I think Train To Busan is the greatest zombie movie of all time. So I was looking forward to this show but with a very average expectation. So I watched the firsts episode and instantly got hooked. The introduced the characters well, friction between all of them was further developed even better as the show progresses. It is fun, thrilling and an entertaining show that had me binging deep into the night. 12 episode and I thought none felts boring. It is a very good show and worth it very much.",8
East Asia,Who greenlit this to be a 12 episode series? It's so dragged. No story just talking talking and more talking for 12+ hrs. It should have been just 6 or 8 episodes. Wasted potential.,6
East Asia,"This is actually my favourite zombie show after ftwd. Even the title is interesting, that's what brought me to the show and how I started watching it and with that I made othe best decision ever. I was a little sceptical at first but the first episode was when I realised how good and amazing it is. I literally love it so much, it's one of my comfort shows. I cannot even put it to words how much I love that show. I mean the characters are cool asf, the story, plot, how authentic and real it look cus it has a high budget. It's literally too good to be true. I'm really looking forward to a season 2. I really recommend this to anyone who loves apocalyptic movies/shows, k-dramas, zombies and much much more. I literally feel so sad after watching it all and I want more of the show. It's that really lame feeling when you finish your favourite show and just don't know what to do. No spoilers here but it truly amazed me and just everything about it is spectacular. There's literally nothing bad about it. And it was such an enjoyment, I really enjoyed every second of the series and it's easily my favourite show at the moment. A solid 10/10 with no doubts. Recommend it 101%!! Watch it you won't regret it!!",10
East Asia,"I really don't understand how anyone can rate this above a 5. It's awful: unrealistic script, bad acting, amateur directing. The zombies are pathetic with their contortions and clicking sound effects. Another reviewer said it should be called We are all stupid. Most poignant comment ever on this embarrassing series. The rotten tomatoes rating doesn't reflect the critics reviews. Don't waste your time.",3
East Asia,"Pretty standard overly dramatic k zombie, the way the characters written are pretty dumb, but then again they are high school students so i guess they were supposed to be dumb? The ever so often comedic bits are pretty much what gets me through watching the while thing. In conclusion, scientist oppar is hot af.",6
East Asia,"Very good Filmography, No unique topic though but let me tell u dat d writer is merciless,He srsly kills any body lmao ,but good story line not boring Like it.....",8
East Asia,I've never seen before like this series. It's amazing show. I really love this series. The friendship the bonding the teamwork and the visual effects and acting. It's really appreciated.,10
East Asia,"I love the series but my annoyance kept piling up because I thought it was a Korea movie that I shouldn't raise my expectations. Not until I saw squid game, with it episodes less than 10. They tried to make it as real as possible and it became a huge success...Why will a Commander commit suicide because he ordered the execution of a small town so as to contain the virus. Thus saving million.. In US such scenerio are called COLLATERAL DAMAGE.No one would persecute him for that!!!I love the K-drama because they are growing so fast and rapid but 90% of their series makes me so mad at the end. I had to stop watching Lee Min Ho because his movies are too childish and his acting too.. not talking about the good looks.I had to recommend this series to a lot of my colleagues after watching the first 6 episodes... And you guys kept disappointing me thereafter.Especially the zombie bully running around the school, he should have been eliminated.. and some scenes are just too dumb.Like Nam ra father sacrificing himself... Come on, I'm a fictional writer.. some sacrifice are just too stupid likewise Na Yeon mom, that's the most disappointing moment ever.Tz_Chilest.",6
East Asia,"I liked this show. It was a good experience watching this and I was screaming when the zombies suddenly came. The most appreciated thing about this series was the makeup, the location and all the things that make zombies look real.",7
East Asia,"A nearly perfect zombie series... definitely worth watching...
The rating should be above 8 star
Underrated...
Again proved that korean dramas makers are ???? creativity, story, visuals, technicalities, choreography..",8
East Asia,"During the 12 episodes with a total running time of over 12 hours, the heart rate displayed on the Apple Watch never dropped below 100.The level of immersion is high enough to maintain tension for a long time, and the various zombies that unfold throughout the play made the drama more interesting.I think the zombie acting was more realistic because the actors learned and practiced the zombie choreography from the choreographer for the zombie acting.I'm really looking forward to season 2.",10
East Asia,"It's not even good, yet people rate higher than 1 star. Slow pacing, lots if unecessary dialogue, conflicts were forced, and mutations were so random. I love zombie movies, but this is just meh. Wasted my time. Skipped through every single episode just to get to the ""good"" parts.",1
East Asia,"After squid game, Korea did they it again! Don't watch the trailer, it will spoil so much. This one is highly recommended, it's wild, entertaining and engaging. There is no nudity,sex and this show feels so real. It's super awesome starting from the 3rd episode. Also a cliffhanger at the end of every episode. Ending is satisfactory. Hoping for the 2nd season.",8
East Asia,"It made me feel that it was something really fresh from the genre.Before delving into why I thought it was good, let's stop for a second to remove the basic prejudice about zombie movies.A lot of people are saying it's yet the old zombie trope and same old thing again. ""Characters trying to survive and dying one by one."" But I don't think it is fair to compare or judge it that way.It's like saying oh this action movie is about characters fighting, then other action movies including characters fighting cannot be good. Or this drama is about a character's life story then other dramas about other characters lives' story is not innovative because both are telling life stories about a character.I am a huge zombie fan, and have watch most of the zombie shows/movies.Obviously the premise is the normal zombie premise but what made the show differentiate from the rest, is the other elements added into it such as character depths, morals, love, hope, hate and friendship. There are characters that will make you laugh, cheer for, like, hate and also get annoyed at. Which in itself is a success because it made you feel that way.It also had twist and turns that are not used in many other zombie flicks. And I have to say as an avid zombie veteran, I was taken by surprise more than a handful of scenes. (Which is not easy at all since I have seen most of them.) And if it managed to make you immediately want to click on the next episode to see what happens next, it has also succeeded.Yes, it got it's bad moments sometimes, can be slow, stupid decisions are made and also a few plot holes. But those are forgiven in the grander scheme of things. The cinematography was beautiful, zombies really well made, acting was amazing by such young actors and action sequences realistically done. And again, in this ""overdone"" genre it managed to be fresh from the rest and made me think about it after the credits were rolling. For a zombie series, it deserved a 10 for me.",10
East Asia,"RIGHT NOW I CAN'T CONTROL MY EMOTIONS ....No words for this series..
..only one word masterpiece...
Especially i like the best scene is conversation between those friends in school roof top??????BTW too much violence.",10
East Asia,Sound and act and speed of zombie like clickers in Last of us game! No Creativity.story poor and thin. Hourly creation decisions.for example why Le Cheongson's mother in spite of know exactly deadly zombies go to school with no plan.part of cafeteria in high school more funny Instead horrible.human and zombies slip like Charlie Chaplin in his moveies! I think 6 is enough for this show.,6
East Asia,"Korean Industry has set high expectations about Zombie movies and dramas. So,if I compare this with these than this is nothing infront of those masterpieces. It is an avarage Zombie drama about how the school students survives from Zombie Apocalypse. I find the reflection of ''High School of dead '' anime somehow. It is because both occurred at school and they kind of have similarities too. However,I enjoyed it without thinking more. For me maybe, 5/6 episodes would be enough. It seemed to be dragged a lot. As there were no survival techniques were shown, all are about running or climbing the floors again and again. There weren't much character development and plenty of plot holes. Most funny thing is some zombies don't even die after killing multiple times. What they are trying to convey? They are immortal??The ending is awful. I don't think there is any season needed, it was already dragged too much but they ended it this way.",5
East Asia,"All of us Are Dead: This is a zombie Survival thriller web series. How this virus spreads from one school to the whole city and everyone is trying to save their lives, is shown in the series. The series gets interesting from the first episode itself. Direction is good but editing could have been better. Every episode is for one hour, so it gets boring at times. The work by all the actors was fantastic and the zombies looked great too. Although the concept was not new, it was heartening to see the way it was presented to us. You can definitely watch it once.",7
East Asia,"The first episodes of this series are wonderful, turning the Hollywood cliché of ill-mannered teens fighting zombies into an almost cartoonish depiction of zombie invasions. Fun. The action is well filmed, the acting adequate and the pacing for the first seven episodes tight and disciplined.Of course, the show is not without major faults, the biggest being characters just standing there as zombies attack, reacting only at the last second. I laughed every time because it plays into the MacGruber joke and does it too many times.Too bad ep 8 is so boring, The series tries to get back on track but loses its way with too much repetition (a sense of deju vu abounds throughout as the series progresses).",7
East Asia,"I enjoyed but i found the story was streched unnecessarily,the same sort of thing kept happening and happening and this could be ended by epi 11,but again streched unnecessarily for the 2nd season.",7
East Asia,"Please do watch this series in little dim light and both headphones sounds little hight. It is very amazing. All episode are ending in such a suspence that u have to watch the next episode at that right time right there ...... Eagerly waiting for season 2
.......,.............
......
.....
.........
Please do watch.",10
East Asia,"This series is really great, in my opinion, this series has performed great in all the effects and scenes, even in the last two episodes, the sad scenes were made very naturally, which also attracted the viewer to the sad atmosphere of the series. The series was great in every way and made me love Korean cinema more.",10
East Asia,"I think the best show i have ever saw in zombies, after the movie Train to busaan this was an epic storyline and the cast were nice.And the best part of this series was that there were two types of zombies (partially we can say that), one is good zombies like Nam-ra as and the other ones are bad zombies.And currently i am waiting for the next season to came.As per my opinion you should go for it to watch this show.",10
East Asia,"What a rollercoaster! If you like any suspenseful (zombie) movies/series (Train to Busan, Kingdom, Sweet Home) with a touch of romance. This is a must watch!Cheong-San & Nim-ra are the ones stealing the show. Cheong-San devotion to his friends & family made his character really likable. You really feel for him. My favorite scene was the library scene of Cheong-San. He really has the toughest action scenes of the whole cast. I hope he is one of the halbies in an upcoming season. For Nim-ra she slowly grown into me from a not so interesting character to one of the main focus of the story.Mostly I have difficulties with the Korean names. I tend to mix them up, but luckily the names here chosen are easier to recognize and to remember.Only thing I missed and I really was anticipating for was a show down between the bullied girl Eung-ji and the bully Gwi-nam. This was a miss since Eung-ji has now all the strength to fight back.Looking forward to season 2!",10
East Asia,"Thrilling and entertaining series. Great acting by each one of the characters, infact few characters are brilliant. Nice story line, A must watch one????",10
East Asia,"In the beginning, good zombie action and students working together, but then around episode 4 just got really boring, by episode 9 I was just saying ""come on, rap this up""",3
East Asia,"Its a good zombie show, was slow at parts but i overall enjoyed the show. Best thing about korean dramas on netflix is i don't have to watch force diversity or identity politics that are plaguing the U. S t.v shows.",8
East Asia,"Absolutely gripping and thrilling from the start. Fingernail biting scenes and total thrill and tension.An amazing show! Totally love it!Harsh, brutal and gory at times, exactly what you would expect.That's how a zombie series/movie is made. Zac Snyder could watch and learn.Pure awesomeness!If you like the zombie topic, this is for you.Two thumbs up!!",10
East Asia,"Review By Kamal KSeason 1 - 6/10""All of us are dead"" is a classic zombie drama with a lot of action, thriller and horror elements. Even though the story is nothing groundbreaking, it doesn't fail to deliver enjoyment to the viewers that seek for zombies and epic action.My overall impression of the drama's story is not very great, not very bad either. It was a mediocre story and there were many unnecessary and illogical things for me to accept. Also, several same (or almost same) things and events happened which made the story repetitive and tedious at times. What I liked the most, was how it manages to show how differently everyone acts in order to survive or to save someone else.Postive -EntertainmentEmotionsNegative -Plot HolesIllogical Things.",6
East Asia,"Such great action and suspense! I absolutely loved how nail biting, exciting and fast paced the show was. I wrote that this show is so stressful that it distracts you from a lot of the character writing issues. I had previously written how the teenagers and adults alike frequently made such selfish choices that it felt unbelievable. I frequently was yelling at the screen wondering why would you do that in a literal life or death zombie apocalypse situation??? Like their choices just didn't seem realistic for this high stake scenario. But then I learned more about the sewol ferry accident and the depressing truth is that the choices of the adults accurately reflect reality. May those left behind Rest In Peace and I commend the show for touching on such a series topic.",8
East Asia,"I am wating for season 2.There are few on-screen situations more dread-inducing than watching a zombie outbreak in real time. Tracking a single infection as it grows exponentially and tears through an unwitting populace is an anxiety-riddled experience that's rarely easy to watch. ""All of Us are Dead,"" the latest Netflix drama to take a stab at a widespread cataclysmic event, announces itself in its opening episode by meticulously showing the transformation of a school. In a single afternoon, the massive Hyosan High School complex is plunged into chaos after one errant bite from a science lab test animal starts an irreversible chain reaction.",10

When it reaches a good spot, it freezes in place. A stalk slowly grows from its head. The stalk then spews out spores that spread, turning others into zombies.This is no Halloween story about the zombie apocalypse. It's all true. The zombie isn't a human, though. It's an ant. And the stalk that emerges from its head is a fungus. Its spores infect other ants, which lets the zombie cycle begin anew.In order to grow and spread, this fungus must hijack an ant's brain. However weird this might seem, it isn't all that unusual. The natural world is full of zombies under mind control. Zombie spiders and cockroaches babysit developing wasp larvae - until the babies devour them. Zombie fish flip around and dart toward the surface of the water, seeming to beg for birds to eat them. Zombie crickets, beetles and praying mantises drown themselves in water. Zombie rats are drawn to the smell of the pee of cats that may devour them.All of these ""zombies"" have one thing in common: parasites. A parasite lives inside or on another creature, known as its host. A parasite may be a fungus, a worm or another tiny creature. All parasites eventually weaken or sicken their hosts. Sometimes, the parasite kills or even eats its host. But death of the host isn't the freakiest goal. A parasite might get its host to die in a certain place, or be eaten by a certain creature. In order to accomplish these tricks, some parasites have evolved the ability to hack into the host's brain and influence its behavior in very specific ways.How do parasites turn insects and other animals into the walking almost-dead? Every parasite has its own method, but the process usually involves altering chemicals within the victim's brain. Researchers are working hard to identify which chemicals are involved and how they end up so bizarrely altering their host's behavior.Brains, brains! Ant brains!A fungus doesn't have a brain. And worms and single-celled critters obviously aren't very smart. Yet somehow they still control the brains of larger, and smarter, animals.""It blows my mind,"" says Kelly Weinersmith. She is a biologist who studies parasites at Rice University in Houston, Texas. She is particularly interested in ""zombie"" creatures. True zombies, she points out, aren't exactly like the type you find in horror stories. ""In no way are these animals coming back from the dead,"" she says. Most real zombies are doomed to die - and some have very little control over their actions.The horsehair worm, for instance, needs to emerge in water. To make this happen, it forces its insect host to leap into a lake or swimming pool. Often, the host drowns.Toxoplasma gondii (TOX-oh-PLAZ-ma GON-dee-eye) is a single-celled creature that can only complete its life cycle inside a cat. But first, this parasite must live for a time in a different animal, such as a rat. To ensure this part-time host gets eaten by a cat, the parasite turns rats into cat-loving zombies.In Thailand, a species of fungus - Ophiocordyceps - can force an ant to climb almost exactly 20 centimeters (about 8 inches) up a plant, to face north and then to bite down on a leaf. And it makes the ant do this when the sun is at its highest point in the sky. This provides ideal conditions for the fungus to grow and release its spores.Biologist Charissa de Bekker wants to better understand how that fungus exerts that mind control over the ants. So she and her team have been studying a species related to the Ophiocordyceps fungus in Thailand. This U. S. cousin is a fungus native to South Carolina. It, too, forces ants to leave their colonies and climb. These ants, though, bite down on twigs instead of leaves. This is likely due to the fact that trees and plants in this state lose their leaves in the winter.De Bekker began these studies at Pennsylvania State University in University Park. There, her team infected a few species of ant with the South Carolina fungus. The parasite could kill all of the different ants she introduced to it. But the fungus made plant-climbing zombies only out of the species that it naturally infects in the wild.To figure out what was going on, de Bekker's team collected new, uninfected ants of each species. Then, the researchers removed the insects' brains. ""You use forceps and a microscope,"" she says. ""It's sort of like that game Operation.""The researchers kept the ant brains alive in small Petri dishes. When the fungus was exposed to its favorite brains (that is, ones from the ants that it naturally infects in the wild), it released thousands of chemicals. Many of these chemicals were completely new to science. The fungus also released chemicals when exposed to unfamiliar brains. These chemicals, however, were completely different. The researchers published their results in 2014.The experiments at Penn State by de Bekker's team were the first to create ant zombies in the lab. And the researchers only succeeded after setting up artificial 24-hour cycles of light and darkness for the zombies and their parasites.It will take more work to learn how the parasite's chemicals lead to zombie behavior in ants. ""We are very much in the beginning of trying to figure this out,"" says de Bekker. She now studies ant zombies at Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich, Germany. There, she is now probing how that daily cycle of sunlight and darkness affects zombification.",5
East Asia,"As a student, I love how the movie tries to portray real-time scenarios during a zombie apocalypse. I also appreciate the cast's efforts in making this tv series. I hope that there is a Season 2.",10
East Asia,"I think it's a well-made zombie movie. Since South Korea is a country where civilians are illegal to have guns, there is no such coolness to shoot and kill like ordinary zombie movies, but I think the tension from the situation where there is no specific way to respond was the best.",10
East Asia,One of the my best series love angle was superb i love it waiting for second season very good story line. First time I tried Korean series it was more than expectations and character of this series were very natural .,10
East Asia,"Nothing can beat this , it contains all things you want , chrachters are too good its awesome. In most series only some episodes are interesting but in "" all of us are dead "" all the episode are so interesting you can't stop watching.",10
East Asia,"The series is really disappointing. It's cliche with borderline cringy lines. It has inferior characters, with plenty of unnecessary scenes. It's such a let down, considering Korean dramas are great with the zombie genre. It has cheap jokes, no good plotline, and overdramatic scenarios.",1
East Asia,"I love everything zombie. Everything. But the majority of characters in this are so damn stupid, unlikeable, selfish or just plain evil. I spent the whole series wishing they'd get eaten or turned because of how terrible most of the characters are. There was a couple of good ones. But the students you're meant to root for are just kind of awful and annoying.Great effects and some great acting, but the characters are so... blah. I suppose that's the point though. Humans don't really deserve to survive since they suck so much. True in a way.",3
East Asia,"I'm so glad that i got to watch such an amazing zombie series. The best part is that they didn't left any loose ends and explained the reason and cause everything very smoothly. And the scenes were too reall i binged watched it and it felt like I'm with those school students .Plus they highlighted the fact of bullying and reality of society, first squid game, then hellbound and then All of us are dead. I'm looking forward to it's season 2.",10
East Asia,It's another wild ride from the Koreans definitely worth watching. Will keep you entertained for a weekend. There are some annoying things about characters I wish they could fix then they really would be superb. The lack of emotions and chemistry between the actors. They are great actors but we need to see a range of different emotions and expressions conveyed. For example you rarely see smiles just dead pan expressions.,8
East Asia,"The zombies are active, very agile and can run fast, which is very important because it will make the audience tense to watch it, even though the content of the story is not as good as the first train to busan, but this is better than the walking dead with weak zombies, hopefully another story will emerge zombies from south korea.",10
East Asia,"Although I am almost 50 I really enjoyed this series. The Korean have proven they ate great story tellers and can do it with smaller budget. But what I really liked is the healthy
ethical and sensible message. And of course it's a bit over the top but to make a point you have to be more clear. The story uses the zombies to get the point across but it could have easily a war situation it's the same thing. How in desperate times you need to come toghether. How vanities and personal loss take an other place in your ego. How friendship is michorw fragile than a social media post. How it feels if you let thing be unset. How everybody deals with stuff differently.",8
East Asia,"This is gonna be one of the best show I've watched this year. The production, directing, characters, performances & everything else is truly superb. I have not binged watch many shows (except Daredevil & Squid Game) because they just don't hook me into them but i was hooked to my screen from the first 5 minutes of this show & binged watched it till the end.Now the performances of every actor was great. I genuinely loved all of the friends, supporting cast & bad guys too. It also reminded me of my school days with some good memories in the first episode. I think this one got it all from being funny to make us emotional & yeah the zombies too that were great!You know this one's underated when extremely below average & dumb Netflix shows like Money heist, Lupin etc., or the other Marvel's Disney+ Hotstar shows got above 90% on rotten tomatoes & shows like this got below 80%.Overall a highly recommend show to binge watch with your friends or family (No unnecessary sex scenes or nudity) . Waiting for the next season.",9
East Asia,"Who doesn't love South Korean zombie productions, 'uh?This one has a cool overall concept, good visuals and a great atmosphere, with some great action scenes, especially some of the chase scenes with the students...... however, it also has severe flaws that nearly ruin the enjoyment.The pacing is horrible, especially in the first half of the show. The show goes to a crawl in some of the initial episodes. Extremely slow episodes with 1h10 run time is crazy. It also completely goes overboard with the clickity-clack loud sounds on the transformations earlier on, too many, too often, too frequently for too long.I won't go into stupid character decisions as plot devices, or the absurd emotional philosophical talks whilst zombies are about to overrun you, or the fact they repeat the 'person transforming into zombie in front of you and everyone watches eagerly' 3 or 4 times in the first episodes, since it's part of a typical zombie show, those are all 'acceptable' as is.Had this show been properly edited, or cut, with a lower, but more relevant run time, and it would have been a sensational hit. As it is, its actually tough to tolerate the bad, to enjoy the good.I liked the cast, most of them did ok, and hope to see some of them in future shows.",7
East Asia,How can a human survive 3 days without food with a good health condition?And why its 12 episodes long? I am truly disappointed after watching this series.,4
East Asia,"This is how a zombie series is made really. It was soo good, it got me hooked from the very start. The characters were just too good. The decisions considering their age seems justified. But some scenes were very comical, and stupid but those can be easily overlooked because I loved this.",10
East Asia,"Loved this! I don't think there was a single episode that didn't keep me on the edge of my seat!It had a little of everything, plenty of violence, funny moments and some really touching moments which won't be everyone's cup of tea if they just want a run of the mill zombie movie!I thought it was fantastic, ended on a cliff hanger so already looking forward to the next season!",9
East Asia,"All in all it's got everything you could want from the Zombie genre, while still avoiding some of the more cliche tropes.The characters get pretty good towards the later half of season 1, but early on they weren't all that interesting or likeable.For some reason most characters were constantly bickering, and being class A a-holes to each other for no reason. This got better quickly though, as the characters had a little time to develop.There seems to be a few inconsistencies so far, in who gets affected in what way by the virus, and why, but I expect that to be expanded upon in future seasons.",7
East Asia,"Terrible story, massive plot holes, incredibly infuriatingly stupid scenes and literally no attachment to any character. I don't watch zombie movies at all and I generally dislike them so I had low expectations to begin with. However, I was actually looking forward to this and was incredibly optimistic, but this has sunk below my lowered optimistic expectations because every single minute there is something to complain about. I don't even care if it had a terrible plot as long as it was fun I would've been okay with it and I really tried hard to enjoy it.This is not an opinion, this is a fact because of just how much evidence there is to support what I'm saying.",3
East Asia,"I loved it really. First of all this journal is my fav I love zombie movies,series yeah this is the second k-zombie series which I liked 1-KINGDOM
2- ALL OF US ARE DEAD.",10
East Asia,"It starts out corny, predictable, bad scripting (or English Translations), and the students making absolutely horrible decisions, or not thinking of or ignoring obvious solutions, but it is entertaining enough to get you to episode 3/4 and then things get so much better. You actually care about the characters and there is some great acting, even through some of the pretty terrible English Translations and tones used by the voice over ""actors.""It is a very good series. You will be entertained. I do hope we get a season 2. This was up there with Squid Games for me as I got further into it, minus the mental illness of Squid Games lol.",8
East Asia,"I love zombie movies not the low budget and corny acting zombies.. but TRAIN TO BUSAN WAS MY FAVORITE ZOMBIE MOVIE OF ALL TIME even though it's a foreign movie THAT SAYS A LOT... (Also watched the movie 5 years late after its first released)...
But this show ALL OF US DEAD... people disliking this show.. lack wisdom and emotion... when this show had all the above.. including hidden messages about humanity in general if you really are paying attention.. to the casting crew, script writers and director.. VERY WELL DONE!!! Koreans films are no joke! Love it! I want season 2 ASAP!!!",10
East Asia,"There's a lot to unpack here, but the core problem is that there are maybe 6 great episodes worth of content in this 12 episode series.When it gets it right, it gets it very right. Love, loss, longing, poignancy, savagery and pathos, it's all there. The writing, acting and production are strong enough to get you engaged, so as the cast get chowed on, you'll feel it.However, it suffers from uneven tone, with too many cliched tropes and characters. Big-awkward guy, punky-girl, straight-laced nerd hottie, alpha and beta heroes, coward, and generic thug villain. You've seen them all before, many times.Some scenes eschew peril for jarring slapstick, which breaks you right out of immersion. There's far, far too much shrieking, repetition, indecision, repetition, pointless sacrifice, and repetition.Still, the effects, both practical, makeup and subtle CGI are top notch, the overall story arc is well conceived, and there are a few touching character developments.It's not amazing, but it's solid, and it ends strongly and credibly without pushing the To Be Continued too hard. Just about worth your time.",6
East Asia,"Decent show - I will admit reading the other reviews I can kind of understand peoples opinions about the first 2 episodes, they are arguably the weakest, and things really pick up in episode 3 and especially in episode 4. Overall though, it's fun, jumpy, some fun characters and awesome zombie chase scenes. Another solid Korean flick - ignore the haters.",8
East Asia,"I was so excited to see this. First three episodes were good but then sloppy writing took place. There is so much that happens that makes ZERO sense. How can people go days and days without water or food? Why wouldn't you hide in a house or store when you know zombies are headed for you; instead, you stand outside? You see someone you care for get bitten and is turning, but you cry and tell others not to kill them?Definitely, the writers need to be replaced for season two and stop writing material that makes no sense. Have some sense of reality and what could happen. The over dramatic teen angst and was too much. By then end, I wanted all of the characters to die because I was so frustrated with the shows.",5
East Asia,So if you have 10 hrs to waste approx you can go ahead and watch this series just meaningless waste of time. After all this hype and korean drama suppose to be good.doesnt come even near our expectation.lame plot its like a loop same thing happening again and again.with same character.not a woth watch.,3
East Asia,"First of all, the effects are good, even though the idea or the plot itself is not original, still an interesting premise to watch. HOWEVER, the characters are unlikeable, so many inconsistent things happened, the more you watch the plot is getting messier, so many dumb actions performed by the characters, like what? Wasting 15 seconds to shot a terrified face for each student while they can actually just throw the zombie out fast is dumb, really dumb. The love triangle doesn't even help with the characters chemistry. So yeah, disappointing.",4
East Asia,"... but not in a good way. Three episodes in and I'm tired of the students making horrible decisions. From standing around while another student turns, tolerating another entitled student, settling on a classroom on another floor when there were plenty on the way to choose from, putting your fellow students and friends in danger by not disclosing that you've been bitten to feeling depressed in the middle of it all when you should feel a sense of urgency. They say that if you can't be a model by showing others how they should do things, be an example by showing others how they shouldn't do things. This series falls into the latter category. The only redeeming thing so far is that there is a fighter and a thinker in the group. Everybody else is, pretty much, useless and a liability. ""#Alive"" and ""Train to Busan"" were more comprehensive. They had their flaws, but not to the extent of this series.",3
East Asia,"Japanese manga did this in 2006 it basically the same thing, the same concept and the character potrate is a tad similar to the manga. I dropped the series in the middle as it resembled the anime which is far better then the series i dont know if the series is inpired by the manga or what but i belive that its not worth the time. Its just a streached version of 24min per ep anime to the 1hr long ep of this series by making the character do the uncanny stupid things. But if you dont wanna watch the anime released in 2006 then its a nice series based on the anime.",1
East Asia,"I stopped watching american zombie dramas and their other dramas, since they always include unnecessary adult scenes, sxx, etc. So happy i found korean dramas.I would give a 10 if only cheong san ending is different. This young actor is very good. They better bring him back in season 2.However other than that, the drama dan the ending is very satisfying.",9
East Asia,"I looked forward to this kdrama and the trailer was quite good as well. So, I had expectations for it. I even completed reading the Web toon to get ready for the watch.But, it was kind of disappointing. I directly compared this drama to ""Happiness"", which is another Zombie centric drama that was aired just mere months ago. While ""Happiness"" had a lot of things right and had found a right balance between the Zombie action and human interactions, ""All of Us Are Dead"" was just mindless actions in most of the episodes. Sometimes quite repetitive to the point that we can easily predict the outcome.I liked the four leads, but other than the characters of Lee Cheongsan and Nam Ohjo which were built well, Lee Suhyeok and Choi Namra's characters could have given much depth. Especially Namra's who had the most interesting character arc. But hers was not explored till the last episode.Likewise there were so many things that fell short of expectations. Including the final explanation that the Webtoon carried. Anyhow, the drama is still enjoyable and the action is good. The settings and choreography are well done as well.Good effort. But overall, the drama is just okay.",6
East Asia,Series was great till middle and I was hooked.. and then episode 8 came and the director took us all for stupid and ruined it. I get it you want to have 12 episode but why ruin it?,2
East Asia,"I don't get those people giving bad reviews about All of us Are Dead! I enjoyed every episode from start to finish. It never loses its momentum. In fact, 12 episodes to me are not that long. I am hoping for a season 2.This show covers everything relevant to societal issues like the pandemic, bullying, political influence, pressure of getting into college, family relationships, friendship, love, human behaviours. I love how they included the youtuber character because he's not just for comedy but it's a reality that people would do stupid thing just for social media views.I like how they got into detail of the origin of the virus and the mechanism of the virus. Most zombie movies don't go into detail with the origin of the virus (usually it's chemical spill and things like that).Each episode keeps you wanting more and the actors played their parts perfectly. The female protagonist, On-Jo is a very realistic character. She's not one of those badass superhero frontal heroine but like most of us, she's an ordinary girl who has to deal with the pain of losing loved ones and yet keep going for the ones who are still alive.This show isn't just about surviving or killing zombies. It shows you every human relationship. In this show, although they show you how cruel humans can be, it also highlights the good side of humans and how one is willing to sacrifice for the good of others.The side stories are all put together very well, without spoiling the main plot. I disagree with the comments saying there are too many unnecessary plots or characters because every side story has an impact and every character has a story to tell.Plot wise, acting wise, visuals, effects, everything is phenomenal. 10/10 absolutely!",10
East Asia,"Oh Korea what have you done?! You have ruined the good name for quality shows you once had by making this atrocious zombie tv show. Episode 1 was long enough to tell your story and end it and it may have been ok, but 12 episodes, wow. 12 episodes of the worst thing I have seen in many years. Congratulations.",3
East Asia,"There is a LOT of drama in this show which at times was a little bit hard to believe because there's an actual zombie apocalypse happening and these high school kids are still worrying about ""who likes who"" and throwing temper tantrums and the protagonist girl giving the cold shoulder to the protagonist guy who has a major crush on her.I also really didn't like how it seemed like the most important person to save during the entire show was On-jo. So many people sacrificed their lives for her and yet she was being so selfish throughout the entire show.But I was willing to look past all of that, as long as they were going to let my man Cheong-san get the girl in the end. But NOPE! They made Cheong-san a simp for On-jo the entire show and then the second she finally starts treating him right, they kill him off.I don't know if this is typical in K-dramas but they made a lot of the guys weak, timid, bumbling buffoons. There was A LOT of female-on-male violence which was more than annoying and the males were always scared of the females and just took their beatings like wimps.There were significantly more female students alive at the end than males, so it promotes the idea that males are expendable and should sacrifice themselves for the females, but also that the females were smarter and better survivors.I'm also mad about them killing off some of the best characters. Like for example they killed off the scientist who created the virus pretty early when he could have played a bigger role in the show. On-jo's dad spent the entire show trying to find her, he finally finds her and then gets bit within 2 seconds of finding her.The episodes are long (around 1hr each) and there is 12 of them so it starts to get a bit exhausting with all the drama but the ending was okay because they left it open for a sequel season but at the end of the day.I enjoyed the show at times and was annoyed at other times so that's why it gets a 5/10. If they let my man Cheong-san live and get the girl in the end it would've been a 7/10 but they did him dirty. Lived and died a simp. Shameful.",5
East Asia,Seriously guys if your going to get paid to write a review by Netflix at least give it a 8. People giving this a 10 is the most ridiculous thing ever.. it's ok I guess maybe because I watched the English dubbed version they may have screwed it up or made it corny on purpose I'm not sure.. giving this a 10 is actually insulting too people who read reviews to be honest.,5
East Asia,"Low budget and the story really sucks it is very slow. The characters are all very annoying, it's just dumb. I think the writers like bullies. If you want to waste time getting annoyed you might want to watch this. This show is not for me.",3
East Asia,Watch it now would do anything to be able to watch it for the first time again i feel empty whenever i'm not watching this but i feel like the shouldn't of killed off cheong su. And should've included more scenes of su hyeok (bare-su) and isak should've died a bit later on so it was more emotional. Diffenatley recomend want to be nam tamra tbh.,10
East Asia,This was a good zombie series ever i seen before. Egurly waiting for second season. I hope this series will release in all languages. We all waiting for tamil dubbing.,10
East Asia,"This series is an excellent series i haven't watch earlier this type of series i love this I want season 2
Netflix if you watch the comments please
I eagerly waiting for season 2
I really love the gang.",10
East Asia,"A story of a father's frustration towards his son not being able to fight back against bullies lead him to create a virus that improves a persons animalistic nature and craving for violence.Although this movie trended worldwide, the step back to how old zombie movies were portrayed was really annoying. The sheer number of ""pause before you act"" moments is the total opposite of how humans act when in danger. One student even mentioning he watched Train to Busan, but still did not know how to act when being hunted by zombies.Also the way the script tries to insert love story has cause the film to be flimsy at times. Givent he fact that these are kids, i can understand that crushes and love are a big deal for them, but i find it irrelevant on this film.Another issue i find with this film is the way they include a ""final boss(Gui-Nam)"" in an already convoluted story. Yet, the final goal of the antagonist was really shallow. Fight sequences usually involves people standing and doing nothing while watching their friends being beaten up.And lastly if you expect a solution and/or a happy ending for this story, there is none. This is the most common way for directors to tell you, ""to be continued...""Overall, it's a good take on the horror of how a government, it's policies, and humans react when their lives are on the line. This movie is good, but would have been better.On a side note, please please can't zombie movies have intelligent protagonist. It's 2022 people, most individuals should have watched one or two zombie movies already.",4
East Asia,There is no coherence whatsoever: zombie turning may go from seconds to several minutes depending on the character. The amount of stupid decisions and unrelatable characters get me siding with the zombies by the 2nd episode. Save yourself from this.,2
East Asia,That girl in the white hoodie took my nerves.So annoying af ngl I nearly quit that show so annoying this girl was. Who cast her ? Real question WHO ? Was that guy on some pills or something ?,7
East Asia,"First you run, then you hide and you fight.Great zombies story, with a beginning very well written..Too much drama I guess, but it's a corean thing..",9
East Asia,This is not just another spin off on the zombie genres. The Koreans have given it a twist and added lots of emotional elements to it. One can relate to each and every character in this series. I am shocked at the talent coming out of South Korea - how do they find such great actors? Each and every person has put so much effort and it shows throughout the 12 episodes. The scale is huge and Netflix has put lot of money in this. Please watch it straightaway if you haven't already.Me and my wife are looking forward to season 2 already :),9
East Asia,"First, I highly recommend watching with original audio and subtitles. The dub version voice acting is just not engaging enough.This classic zombie plot series stands out by deeply portraying a variety of characters who don't typically frustrate the viewer by making poor decisions. You begin to connect with the characters and empathize with their decisions. Don't get too cozy with them as the series takes a GOT ""no character is safe"" approach.From start to finish each zombie encounter felt real. Nothing seemed too absurd including the various emotional impacts of certain decisions.Excellent series with minimal areas for improvement!",9
East Asia,"I did noy expect this movie to be very good but it did surprise me in many ways. Definitely its the best zombie movie right now.It has pretty much everything - good evolving story, zombies, kids, love stories and politicians, nice cliff hangers in each episode etc.",10
East Asia,"I really looked forward to this Kdrama, I'm a huge fan of Korean shows and as always i'm thankful that I started watching this. I think I have it a 8/10 because I'm not a huge fan of zombie movies or series but after all it was really good.",8
East Asia,"Over all show was ok. Too long. Characters kind of doing the same thing over and over again, episode after episode. Started out ok as things fall apart. Decent stories on the people involved. Really started to drag about half way. Too many repeat battles with the main antagonist. Srsly? Ending couple of episodes were a bit better than the middle episodes. I think this genre has gone on a little too long.",5
East Asia,"I enjoy K-Drama with Train to Busan going down as a top 5 zombie movie of all time. In it, you saw the motivations for why people acted the way that they did.In this series, I think the mistake was having 12 episodes, meaning they had to stretch out the story using manufactured drama, lots of it, in every single show. There was no reasoning or explanation on people's actions and reactions(Episode 3 will make you toss something at your TV). Also, having a very weak protagonist who causes the death of other people is never a good idea. This series is more closely related to dreadful Army of Dead than Train to Busan. Most of the decisions are just plot devices for failure. At one point you stop caring who lives or who dies.The people who like this will be the same people that say Real Housewives is good reality TV or really liked Twilight. The rest of us is a no.",4
East Asia,It's wonderful series I can't wait for 2nd session. I finished this series within 12 hours I watched still a night because I can't stop myself to stop watching this amazing series.,10
East Asia,"I just dont get the hype on this, its just another cliché, high school zombie apocalypse movie. I just dont get the hype on this, its just another cliché, high school zombie apocalypse movie. I just dont get the hype on this, its just another cliché, high school zombie apocalypse movie. I just dont get the hype on this, its just another cliché, high school zombie apocalypse movie.",6
East Asia,"Is by far the best thing about this show, that kid was a legend! Ha.Was actually routing for him in this......but I can't figure out how the squid game girl looks about 10 years younger in this ?",8
East Asia,"Korean shows tend to be really hit or miss for me. Sweet Home, My Name, and Squid Game are all great shows with well-developed characters who act in a believable way given their situations. This show is definitely a miss for me though. The writing seems to focus only on making things dramatic; characters do terrible and dumb things for no discernible reason, since in many cases they haven't been developed enough. The kid on the roof who we barely know screws everyone over because... reasons? The Military commander is ruthlessly evil in some scenes and then in other scenes tries to take the high ground and and lament what they have to do, and it just doesn't feel coherent. The writers also forgot that humans need water to survive, even though one of the students says in one of the earlier episodes that they are already dehydrated. It even starts raining at one point and NOT ONE PERSON thinks to get a bucket or something and collect some drinking water. The EMS father finds a stockpile of guns and only brings one because ...? And then he gives his only gun away before he even gets to the school? Soooo much stupidity in this show. I could go on and on but you get the point. If all you want is drama and you don't care about character decisions making sense, then by all means give this show a go. But if you are the type who gets annoyed when characters behave in dumb or unbelievable ways, stay far, farrr away.",4
East Asia,"I've watched a lot of zombie movies and TV over the years, and I thought All of Us Are Dead was among the best. The action was often incredibly exciting and tense, and the high school students' developing relationships seemed emotionally believable to me. (I mostly watched in Korean with English subs - the English dubbing struck me as weak, causing many dialogue exchanges to sound stilted and overacted.)Also, even when I like an action show where a group of characters is in constant danger, I usually think repeatedly, ""You're such an idiot, you deserve to be killed."" But I can't remember thinking that here. Sometimes the characters make mistakes, but, to me at least, they're realistic mistakes that might actually happen in stressful moments.Anyway, it's the rare new series like this one that keeps me from cancelling Netflix.",9
East Asia,Its an averge teen zombie series the only thing special about this one is the action scene in 1st and 2nd episode its filming really well .. after that is gets bad .............,5
East Asia,"All good but ending was disappointed me. And too longer Series , maximum 8 episode for this series. Not so good not so bad .One time watchable.ygyhck ufjxdjvhb dydhvkbjc.",7
East Asia,"Although there were some minor illogic scenes but overall its good. Its not a waste even its a paid drama. Its too short though, should be 16 or 20 episodes.The ending reveals that there will be a sequel which I can't wait.",8
East Asia,"Storywise, I like this series better than ""Happiness"" because the happy ending is not too forced.However, in terms of the actors, especially the ML and FL, Happiness won. Both ML and the FL are so good looking and attractive in Happiness while on this ""All of us are dead"" are not as attractive as the other series.Nevertheless, Hyeong syuk - Nam Ra are definitely my favorite characters here.The zombies were also more realistic here than Happiness.Another part that I feel very realistic was when they needed to go to the toilet. The fact that you're fighting the living dead doesn't make you immune to pooping and peeing!!I hope there would be 2nd season bc I'm curious about Nam Ra story.",8
East Asia,"It actually started off great. Interesting characters, very creative cinematography, and great acting. But as the show went on, it got dumber and dumber with plot holes, bad writing, inconsistencies and things that just don't make sense. I was hoping this would be a Korean 'series', along the likes of Kingdom, Extracurricular, Stranger, Squid Game to name a few. But instead it's just a 'K-drama' with zombies. To give credit where credit is due; the acting for the most part is excellent. The cinematography (at least in the earlier episodes) is very creative, especially the one take sequence in episode 2. The stunts by everyone (especially the zombie actors) is incredible and the action choreography is excellent. Just wish it was written and directed better.",5
East Asia,You will really like this web series .The main strong point in this series is the all character have performed their best and it will make audience strongly bond with character.please ye series ko ek baar jarur dekhiye.,10
East Asia,At first it seemed mostly korean soap drama but as it progresses the story gets better and better. It was enjoyable and I liked the way people would react (from ordinary people to military and even political people).,9
East Asia,"I honestly had no idea of what I was getting into. I only recently got into KDrama so this is a whole new thing. But I'm not going to give this a 10 star as for my anger towards the huge unexpected plot twists! Yet in a way its intriguing and entertaining. I did cry about this show because of the way the main characters died, but I also was angry of how it's displayed the term zombies. Sure its not a scientific explanation of zombies but I feel it could've been different by the normal stereotype. I did feel a little sick of how real it looks though!",8
East Asia,"Well yes there are some plot hole in this series but yeah idk I didn't care at all LOL
The tension and thrilling moments are so good and fun, I just enjoy when watch this series.Namra is the coolest and my favorite character in here. I keep watching this because of her. She's so brave and calm and wow...just cool. The love story between Namra and Suhyeok is my favorite scene. I NEED THE SEASON 2 ASAP!",8
East Asia,"Poor script, bad acting, repetitive, bad editing, average CGI. This is good for teens who never watched great zombie movies before like Train To Busan, Walking Dead, World War Z, 28 Days Later, 28 weeks later.",5
East Asia,"All Of Us Are Dead is mind blowing web series. It's special for me as like other Korean movies and series it's really close to reality with small fictional touch and it beautifully show cases every possible human reaction and thinking people can make in such place.My Review is 10 of 10 ??
A perfect mixture of action l, drama l, humour, love and emotion.",10
East Asia,"What a story... It's marvellous every episode is very interesting and very emotional when someone turned into zombies.. Especially your favourite characters... Hatts off such an exciting, engaging, n thriller story...wait for season 2.",10
East Asia,"Okay, first thing first, I'm not a fan of zombie movie or series AT ALL. But this show was still good and I was binge-watching and finished watching for 1.5days.The plot was probably nothing special, but still well-made and enough to make me addicted. The story is combined with fear, teenagers love story, family love and some hint of resemblance of Covid-19 world.",9
East Asia,"This show had me from the very first frame, the cinematography is what drew me in first, then the story and the actors all are excellent in their roles. There is so much going on in each episode and each episode is an hour or so Long. I'm on episode 7 and can't wait for my boyfriend to get off of work so we can watch the rest Tonight. This is a crazy good show.",10
East Asia,"This is easily the best Korean drama I've ever seen. The action is sustained, well-paced and highly engaging, the stunt choreography is arguably the best I've seen across any genre, any country, and the acting and script are top notch. It avoids the repetitive and expositional motifs of a lot of Korean tv, doesn't have any significant filler and manages to keep saccharine moments to a minimum for what is mainly a high school horror drama. The episodes fly by despite being either side of an hour in length, and while I would love a 2nd series, it sits perfectly as a stand-alone. The zombies are scary and amusing at the same time, it has mastered Korean tv's knack for intrinsic comic timing, and the villains are genuinely intimidating. Also the best zombie tv show I've ever seen, tonally it's more 28 Days Later than the Walking Dead (thank god). 100/10, would recommend.",10
East Asia,"The show started in a brilliant way and I thought this would be some unique in the zombie genre. As things were shown in a very realistic way. But, the way the episodes moved forward I started to lose interest. As I felt some middle episodes were so repetitive & lengthy. The show didn't deserve 12 hrs runtime. After finishing the season I can say the story would've been completed within 8 - 9 hrs max. One thing I can't deny is that this show was technically brilliant.Each character had its own story, it's not a problem for a series. But, in a Zombie apocalypse it has been shown in a very stretchy way. In the other hand, some characters didn't end up the way they should've been. As an audience we get to know so many things but the character didn't, that's the reason it was very disturbing to watch some scenes. Last 4 episodes were too much interesting and were the best episodes of the show. Good thing is that we get to know some good survival techniques.Finally, it's not the best in zombie genre but of course A Very Good Watch.Available on Netflix.© Zombieddict.",7
East Asia,This was amazing! I actually enjoyed this series more than Squid Game! Everything was perfectly timed. A lot of the characters had development and grew throughout the series. Wonderful! Can't wait for season 2!,10
East Asia,"Despite being helm by a primarily a young cast of high school students, everyone delivered their roles really well, and you could really feel their emotions as they make their ways through the endless waves of zombie attacks, dealing with the sadness of losing their friends/loved ones and struggling to stay hopeful in the wake of such dire circumstances.Overall, it was a genuinely enjoyable zombie thriller where you will feel the excitement, laugh and cry together with the students as they fight for survival!",1
East Asia,"I like South Korean movies and series. But what a waste this one, a typical Netflix production. No strong story, directing and not ever once complelling. Too bad SK.",5
East Asia,"Honestly looks like they had everything (budget) to make this a great tv show
unfortunately is horrible and poorly written.The characters omg , where should l start?Are we suppose to do think that teens in schools are so dumb?Zero skills to survive or think head ?One of the main character the fight fighter daughter , shockingly slow and dumb or maybe she has some mental issues?But overall all the characters super sad, pathetic, useless.Why did the writers write such a thing?Not even one of them was switch on.Also some flashbacks about happy memories super super cheesymaybe if you are a boy/girl under 10years old you might love it but if you have some decent intelligence you might feel this is extremely sad and dumb.Example they see someone no zombie yet and they wait until he/she become a zombie and then they start screaming :P instead of killing it before
. That happened many many times.And many others situation are actually hard to watch.The Adults acting is actually very bad too.Like l said before its a shame because they had all to make this great.And instead they made everyone useless and no charismatic at all.I couldn't have any sympathy with any of them at all.Please try to make it a little realistic at least a little this was sad.",1
East Asia,"When I first started watching this show I was interested in the plot. The first few episodes were really promising, like something big was going to come in the future. Well that never came. After the first half of the show, it became stale and the main characters took every wrong decision possible without any reason at all, which led to them getting killed of.Another thing that bothered me is that the main characters ignored the fact that the zombies could be killed by stabbing them to the neck, although some of them did it a lot of times. I mean like nobody said ""Hey the zombies can be killed by stabbing them to the neck, maybe we should just kill them instead of pushing them"".Good try but not enough. 6/10.",6
East Asia,"This show has all the check-marks you'd expect from a fairly high budget show.And yet, it all falls completely flat as it tries to present a gruesome horror setting, combined with corny and comedic anime-like characters and situation handling.It's watchable from start to finish ... but you really need to turn your brain off ... almost to the point like a zombie at at least half of it ...Some episodes are bloated by either dragged out scenes or by repetition. Watching someone turn for the 6th time, in the same dramatic way, without previously building an emotional connection to those characters is played out by the 3rd episode.Most of the situations are handled borderline moronic, and the consistency of the plot is reminiscent of a wet fart.The worst of it was suffered by the dialog. It was either written by a computer, or a person who'd previously had very little social interaction with others.If I'd have to come up with key-words that best describe the show, they would be: inconsistent, borderline comedic, dragged out and non-sensical.I still can't decide if this was intended to be a comedy or a satire of the zombie genre, because it definitely can't be taken serious as horror/drama. And the show is self aware of what it's trying to do, as its characters reference the far better executed Train to Busan in more then once.I'm aware that it's a zombie movie, so it's a ""turn your brain off"" kind of viewing, but this show puts absolutely no effort into trying to take itself serious even within it's own imaginary world.This would have worked 100% better as an animated feature considering the cartoonish characters situation handling and presentation.",5
East Asia,"When it's come to South Korea series, There's always fans who voted 10/10 instantly.Some character is annoying as hell with no backup reason. Some character can be so dumb in one scene, and be so smart in the next scene.If you don't like to watch series with a bunch of stupid decisions and stupid plot, you will not enjoy this series.Btw, I'm actually a South-Korea Series fan, but not this one.",4
East Asia,"Its horrible, I didn't enjoy any of it except for episode 1 that's the only reason im giving it 3 stars. It has bad acting for example On-jo never moves her arms its like they're just there, and the shots where they talk it feels like they aren't even talking to eachother. And don't get me on how stupid the characters are especially the students, even though they know what zombies are and everything they never get a weapon, it never crosses their mind to be quiet and in the first classroom it never crossed their minds to block the windows. It has massive plotholes and the storyline is just bad.",3
East Asia,"Great story and very relatable characters, even tho some of them are incredibly annoying but that just gives more points to realism of charachter diversity. 10/10.South Korea really made them self a king when it comes to zombie genre with entries like Train to Busan, Kingdom and now this beautiful gem.",10
East Asia,"An absolute gem, great story, great acting and fantastic make up and effects. Flew through the season and left me hoping for season 2. I can't recommend enough. Teen woes, deadly zombie virus, desperate rescues and sacrifices. No one is safe.",10
East Asia,"The series is very wonderful and luxury, it is full of action, mystery and zombies, it was as if I lived the atmosphere like them, here I learned the value of teamwork and how to survive without food or drink.",9
East Asia,"This show had some things going for it. The government that is actually competent, the original (as far as I know) idea of halfbies and the fact that's it not in the US made me hope for a unique take on a zombie show.However, this show falls into the same mistakes as so many of its competitors: illogical decisions and behaviour by the survivors. It tires me to think how many times this show did the thing where everybody stand around the person who is, as everyone is very aware of, about to turn into a zombie, but instead of taking advantage of the zombies weakness before it fully turns, they stare at it with mouths wide open. This stands among many plot holes and issues I had with the show, from very general things like the dumb self-sacrifices to specific things like the forest hiking sequence in the last episode where On-Jo follows the golden ribbons. I don't think I have to explain why that scene was ridiculous.Going into this show, I was excited for a good take on a zombie show and was, in most aspects, disappointed.",6
East Asia,One of the best zombie shows I've ever watched and I've watched a lot. Amazing from start to finish. Likeable characters awesome action scenes lots of gore. Korean tv at its best.,10
East Asia,It's just Fantastic from the starting till the end it keeps the audiance entertained not even a second u ll feel bore ....I'm waiting for season 2 .....when season one is excellent i don't know how they will keep up the same excitement for season 2 bcz it's not possible to make thgs even better than season 1 ....,10
East Asia,"As an avid zombie fan I put this in my top 5 best zombie shows / movies of all time. The acting from the zombies is phenomenal. It's realistic feeling, blood everywhere, bodies slamming every which way exactly like it would be if this were real life. I have wondered in several scenes whether anyone actually got hurt, I mean they go HARD. Could the dubbing be better - of course, I'm yet to see a dubbed show or movie that couldn't have been better however this is the best I've seen yet. I can only hope they make more like this.",10
East Asia,"Brain-dead, that is.When they don't use their heads, they get eaten.When they try to use their heads, they do it badly, and get eaten.Then they do it again.Slightly less lazy writers could have made the series a banger.The actors and everyone besides the writers did a great job.How many characters is 150?

East Asia,"I'm amazed how many of you are saying that is a great zombie idea.I'll tell you is NOT.First episode started well and then when infection strikes all of the students started to play too dumb, their reaction is not realistic at all, when you see zombies coming to you, you simply run like hell not playing around the zombie crowdAfter 5 minutes of second episode I said NO. It' not worth my time.",4
East Asia,"Last episode let it down with characters making stupid decisions to go after lost causes and having weak dialog. I think the show could have concluded on the 11th episode and I'd have been happy at that. At the best of times the show was frustrating watching characters bicker with each other in life and death situations or seeing them needlessly sacrifice themselves.Another particularly frustrating thing to see was Nam-Ra only utilise her strength in the last episode when she could have done more in previous episodes to help the group.Also at times it was very convenient how dozens zombies would be chasing characters in one scene, and then in the next scene it wouldn't show how the characters had somehow outran them, the particular scene coming to mind is Onjo's father in the stairwell during the evacuation of the politicians.Some things I really liked: the virus origin story, it was refreshing to see a different take with a zombie virus that could be explained. And with a sad story behind it. I also really enjoyed the setting of most of it taking place in the school. The show was very tense at times, and the setting really added to it.I really liked Park Mi-Jin, her bratty attitude and lines were very funny. And Onjo's father and his undying will to save his daughter really added the sad drama to the show.The show also created some very good characters which you want to see fall, and it delivers on that front as well.Overall while not a perfect show, it is very entertaining and delivers a fresh addition to the zombie genre. Hopefully that is the show done because I wouldn't want to see them make another season.",7
East Asia,"Netflix's bots are rating this up, otherwise I don't understand how this could be a +7 / almost 8 serie. Do you a favor and don't loose time with this one.",1
East Asia,"A different kind of zombie story with good actors and lots of goore, but suffers from inconsistence wrighting.Interesting plot, realistic science and creative tactics.Stupid characters, ridiculous logical decisions and lots of plot holes.All in all a show i recommend to watch, if you can stand people screaming all the time while still trying to hide from flesheating zombies attracted to sound.",7
East Asia,"From like 20 characters only 3-4 characters who have good acting, the rest is meh, many plot holes,and the story is average,the characters doing dum thing and that make no sense because it workwith that budget they should make a far better series than this,kingdom is far better than this if you want watch korean zombie.Character development is meh,
the only good character is the bully villain with white jacket, the annoying girl with pink jacket and the mc.The Dectetive,the one who good in fight,the Big boy,mc best friend,and class leader is decent,the rest team is trash, fmc trash, archer girl and her friends trashthe only good thing about this series is cinematography.",5
East Asia,"All of us are deadBursting with well executed zombie action scenes and a plot that's as emotional as it is dire and dreadful. It is also teeming with an array of characters that you would love and hate. It starts and ends well, in a way that accommodates a second season if approved.It was also overly long and drawled, leaving room for so much redundancy. A lesser number of episodes with shorter runtime would have worked better.",8
East Asia,"The show is intense but still has humor. Not as dark as the Kingdom, but intense enough for a zombie show. I think it is the only zombie show that looks so much into the humanity and relationship, and social problems. So in that sense, it is quite soft, not as hardcore as the Kingdom.",8
East Asia,I do like this show alot for what it is. The plot is engaging and emotional and the action scenes are exciting I just have one problem with it that was frequent throughout. If you're one of those people that hate when people make dumb decisions in scary movies you will agree with me here. There is way too much standing around when people should be running away.. and does somebody have to coincidentally fall down every time they are running to add suspense? If someone you know gets bitten do you really need to stand there and cry for 5 min while zombies are actively chasing you. Just so many situations where common sense in a survival situation is just thrown out the window and it just kills me sometimes lol. But besides that I'd say this is overall a good zombie show and despite my criticisms I still binge watched the whole thing as apparently I still wanted to see more/what would happen next.,7
East Asia,I really don't understand the logic behind all of these good reviews. Only watched two episodes and I couldn't find myself to finish the rest. The concept was good but watching a show where all the characters are dumb af is extremely aggravating and makes you want to throw the remote at the screen. Every character makes stupid decisions and just stands there and does nothing the entire time. This show was a joke. Nothing compared to the masterpiece of train to Busan.,1
East Asia,I really wanted to like this series. Interesting start. Lovable and hateable characters. Wayyyyyyyy overdrawn and annoying at times. They jumped the shark so many times.The plot holes are cavernous.It's so cheesy it's disgusting.It's pretty much anime in live action. Not in a good way.,2
East Asia,"Just finished the last episode of All of Us Are Dead, and was so utterly underwhelmed that it felt like taking to IMBd to write my first and only review was the closest I'd come to feeling vindaction after being duped by the +7 average rating.For the people checking out the IMDb ratings, weighing whether or not to get into this show like I was, there are no spoilers, because this review is for you.Having watched Squid Game and Parasite, I was quick to buy in to the high praise, figuring I could get past a quirk or two that comes with the dubbed over English translation, in lieu of a good storyline. There were definitely quirks, but more glaring were the absurdly ridiculous plot holes, (ie. Seemingly insurmountable situations inexplicably overcome courtesy of a convenient cut scene), unrealistic/completely irrational behavior of the characters in the show (where the thought that ""no one in their right mind would do that"" takes away from the everything else), and protagonists that flat out suck to watch.Giving credit where credit is due - I did watch all 12 episodes after all; albeit, teetering on turning it off the entire time. It brings just enough to the table to keep you invested in terms of production value and SFX. I will also say, it does bring a fresh take to the zombie genre as other reviewers have mentioned.But all of the good is heavily outweighed by the crimgeworthy dialogue, the comically poor decisions of the main characters, and the lazy writing leading to jarring gaps in storyline.If you read this and decide to watch anyway, which you probably will, do yourself a favor by drastically lowering your expectations. And if after the first 11 episodes, you aren't yet completely pissed off that you're still watching, then the last episode will surely do the trick, (ep 12 is an infuriating turd of a conclusion that will finally confirm your suspicions that, yes, you too were also catfished by that 7.7 IMDb rating"").",4
East Asia,"Guess what this Gen Z said ""This show is so violent "" lol what ? This is zombie apocalypse not romance, do you think this is Hollywood when there's kisses and nudity and cringy criticism? No this is korean they work so hard , they have incredible actors and all the crews behind camera , this is not WARM BODIES OR WORLD WAR Z , if you want no violent shows go somewhere in Netflix you will find bunch of garbage, btw I loved this series and I hope to see more of this story in future because we all now that netflix doesn't care if you liked or not ,they care about views numbers if this is successful so 100% there's s2 and 3 .",10
East Asia,If you want crippling depression this show will give it for sure. It has fantastic writing which builds suspense and has meaningful characters. I would definitely watch this show with someone as it can get really intense. It is never hard to follow and has a solid plot. I enjoyed watching this show even though it did not end like I would have wanted.,10
East Asia,"""All of us are dead"" is a classic zombie drama with a lot of action, thriller and horror elements. Even though the story is nothing groundbreaking, it doesn't fail to deliver enjoyment to the viewers that seek for zombies and epic action.My overall impression of the drama's story is not very great, not very bad either. It was a mediocre story and there were many unnecessary and illogical things for me to accept. Also, several same (or almost same) things and events happened which made the story repetitive and tedious at times. What I liked the most, was how it manages to show how differently everyone acts in order to survive or to save someone else.",7
East Asia,"Another master piece of Korean Zombie movies. After Train to Bushan this is a take to live the struggle to live. Average 12 hours are worth giving. All characters did strong enough to wait for next season. Among all this kind of movies realizes us that what is different to be a human. Relationship, family and friends. The sacrifices which worth to keep your beloved breathing.LOVED the 12 hours waiting for another.",8
East Asia,"I started this show with very high hopes, as it's first episodes shown well done Zombie action. The makeup was really great, the effects were cool, and overall, everything Zombie related was pretty well done. And although that persisted throughout the episodes, I must say that it's script is, sadly, one of the stupidest, worst written and most obnoxious ones I've watched in a long time.Every time, every single time, a character opened their mouth or made any kind of decision, I just wished for all the cast to be eaten by zombies right then and there. Every single death from this first season was due not to the zombies themselves, but to every single character in the show having less common sense than a rock. Characters made the worst decisions they could have for every single scenario.This became extremely obnoxious half through the season, and the last two chapters I just straight skipped dialogue scenes because I couldn't bear to watch more of the plot.The zombies are cool tho, so if you are a fan of the genre, I guess it's still enjoyable to some extent. Just be prepared for the plot.",5
East Asia,I like this korean series... The emotional scenes and the characters are the highlighted one.also the acting of gwi nam is truly wonderful.does chong san really died? I give hope for the return of chong san.. He is such a awesome character... I liked him. Waiting for 2nd season.,9
East Asia,"Simply put, this series had a great opening but jumped the shark as quickly as it began. The characters are what reduced my score from potential 8 stars. They simply became too annoying from half-way and on. I got so infuriated with the teenagers whining and arguing to no end. The whole season was like watching a cat fight. I can see one or two brash characters, but almost all of them either physically or mentally abuse one other. Is that Korean culture for kids to act that way? There are barely any redeemable quality any of the teens possessed. And some plots dragged for far too long like Gwami and the suicidal girl (forgot her name). She is the perfect character to be redeemed; to do something that mattered to the plot in a positive way. Sadly they made her an even more of a depressing villain. It's sad to say, but I kind of wished all of the kids turned at the end. They were that badly written.",4
East Asia,"Although this is a Teenage horror. It is probably rated 19+ for the gore. The horror, as in other Kdramas ike Squid Game, Hellbound, is something other than the obvious. It is also about the people around you and bullying - even when you turned into a zombie.That's the clever part. But there are inconsistencies (like unnecessary sacrifices, stupid moves, and turning up the sentiments - parents dying ), some continuity issues in the beginning and maybe suffers a bit from a large cast. The chaos breaks out at end of episode 1 before all the characters were introduced just to grab your attention. And that is a bit hasty. We want entertainment, but we are not starved.At first there were multiple groups, including the cop that was interviewing the science teacher, the first aid x military dad, the arrow group and the main group in the music studio. This is needed to connect and elaborate the story but you know who is the main character group is. It would be too perfect for bullied girl to get even with the annoying bullying guy. There are some good plot points with mutation, rain/ thunder and toilet making.There are also well done set pieces like the intentional infection, rooftop scenarios and the dispair turning into some hope last episode. Technically well done but some holes like martial law can order such a strike without Parliament/heads of state approval? The assembly person seems to be a setup for next season? The rain gave them water, but no food for like 4-5days???",7
East Asia,This web Series Batter then other Zombie web series.And i really like this all characters.spacial Nam-ra an gwi-nam. And This series want a 9/10 Rating.An I want know about last scene..?An I'm very excited for second Season.,9
East Asia,"Only get what netflix has and this is ten times better than that new overacted series Chocolate its nice to see a Korean man treat a lady politely unlike the majority of KD.
It's silly and cute but people do die in it so not just a soft series.",9
East Asia,"Recently, I have been trying so hard to get hooked on another K- drama. All I ask is that they keep the humor fresh and the romance sweet.In two episodes, I am already drawn in. I now hope that some romance occurs, but the future of this drama is yet to be determined.The series follows Ye Ri, a South Korean heiress when she accidentally falls into North Korea after a paragliding accident. All because of a tornado that had flying tractors. I laughed when she pointed that out.I hope Ye Ri has a good character development arc, I would love to see her grow. You bet I will continue to watch this. Sign me up, you got a fan.",10
East Asia,"Look id give this a 10 but I'm only into it 5 episodes in and who knows if its gonna get stupid i dont think it will but will adjust my rating later if needed, typical i hate 90% of KD for the obvious reasons but the 10% that are good are really good and have to say this is pretty flawless, the two main characters have chemistry and the writing is spot on.I you dont like this your wasting your time with KD because this is first rate in every way.
this should be the highest rated show in Korea but it isn't because it's not a childish romcom per say",9
East Asia,"I don't watch much KD or Korean movies as so many are the same kind of romance drama repackaged. So far this one has kept my interest except when Yoon Se-ri stopped being the strong woman she started out as.
One reason this KD does not have a higher rating in SK and US is that it airs on cable channel/pay TV/ Netflix which normally have a relatively smaller audience compared to free-to-air TV/public broadcasters (KBS, SBS, MBC and EBS).",9
East Asia,"What makes this KD different from other KDs?
1. They used older actors which IMO are better in acting. Hyun Bin & Son Ye Jin are definitely the best choice for RJH & YSR character. The chemistry are inevitable!
2. The story is flawless and not boring. There's a speck of love story, comedy, and action in one KD. What not to love?
3. Beautiful sceneries. Omo.
4. Everything makes sense. No stupid magic or ghosts whatever.",10
East Asia,"Anywhere from ""Memories of the Alhambra"" to extreme like ""Rampant"" , ""Crash Landing on You"" is by far more captivating. Anywhere from little hints to Looks of shuttle love gets me on the edge of my seat, but it's his emotions that make it so heartbreaking. He really brings so much emotional acting to the scenes and I should have known watching memories of the Alhambra. But, this has definitely got me hooked. Everyone wants a knight and shining armor with an edge. Korean dramas are much more on spot compared to many and I have to say the writers went where the love and mystery meet...where no one can go. Thank you and I hope to continue watching many more!",10
East Asia,"I even joined to this page to rate u guys. that's the only way we can pay our gratitude for u on making such a great drama. I really love this drama.I've got no words. I love the whole team guys.
I've been waiting for something like this and happy that i was recieved it. I am so in love with all actors and most specifically Hyun Bin and Ye jin. Thanks for the amazing acting.
Don't like to get addicted to dramas,that's what I usually do.But I failed this time. I am so much crazy about the whole drama,can't even wait up for new ones.
Anyway,will remember this love story forever and i hope there's gonna be a happy ENDING.
Love and hugs for y'all.
Sew from Sri Lanka...",10
East Asia,"I didn't have words describe this drama.
I love the two actors
the chemistry between them very beautiful
I can't wait each week for new episode ????????",10
East Asia,This is as romantic as Colin firths Pride and prejudice. It pulls my heartstrings perfectly. Great story with no obvious way to resolve the conflicts. (Love that I am spending time wondering what will happen next and then being surprised by what actually happens!) Very well crafted (I particularly love the music). Super cast. I'm on episode 8 and it's a 10/10 so far. Irish romantic comedy fan.,10
East Asia,If you're looking for a drama with a different storyline and a different atmosphere it would be a perfect choice.The actors play natural and they won't disappoint you.There is always a beautiful smile on my face each time I watch an episode.I haven't watched the whole episodes yet but sure will love it till the end.,8
East Asia,"What a unique story!! Imagine a rich businesswoman from S Korea goes paragliding in her freetime to de-stress and gets caught in a tornado that blows her into N Korea. She gets rescued by a handsome army guy and his rag-tag troop of subordinates (belovedly nicknamed ""the ducklings""). The army captain ends up having to rescue her and protect her many times over, and she continuously stymies and befuddles this straight-laced, Joe Friday, ""Just the facts, Ma'am"", pragmatic officer.Americans: Get past the one-inch barriers called subtitles and allow the looooong, dramatic pauses to roll off your shoulders (there aren't as many as other K shows). The characters are so well written that you will love them all. Even the bad guy played by Man-Seok Oh is sooooo good at being bad (not to mention a cutie too). You get all you could ever want in an entertaining show with this one. Give it a whirl!!!",10
East Asia,Best actors! best drama ever! Totally worth to watch! Only love for these people! ?????,10
East Asia,"I don't watch korean series much! just randomly play this series on netflix, but this is exception. the more episode i seen .. i the more i am in love with the story line, characters of each role and many more.Hyu Bin & Sonye Jin you guys are rock! Congrats for making korean series worldwide via Netflix",10
East Asia,"With this KDrama, we have a proven team: terrific writer, director, co-stars, and cast in a delightful love story but also lots of fun with the captain's squad, the village ajummas, a really evil bad guy, and jokes and teasing. These charms are combined with the longing for reunification that handles both North and South Koreans with love and respect. And both leads are at their most beautiful and talented. I swear Hyun Bin has never been better with that quiet, low voice, steady eyes, and sly smile taking every scene but never dominating. And, of course, Son Ye Jin is wondrous: beautiful, brilliant, touching, and hilarious. This series is a treat.",10
East Asia,The best so far...Watched the whole 8 episode in one seating. Looking forward to next episodes thinking what would happen next!! The story line is unpredictable. They are all soooo good and beautiful. I love the funny scenes especially Se Ri's cuteness. Even Captain Ri's father scenes were so funny even they're not trying to.Please continue to produce more!!!,10
East Asia,"I could write an essay about this drama, and we're only on episode ten. I'm a very critical person and it sucks because it's hard not to find fault in almost everything. I've been waiting for that dissapointing moment since episode one, and I'm baffled but still waiting. So far this show has literally been perfect, at least for me. The casting and acting have surpassed even my high expectations, the settings have been jaw dropping, the attention to detail when it comes to North Korea, even though it's not, it totally sells it that it is. You can tell the writer really took out all the guns on this one and tried to do her best work, and it shows. True, there's still six episodes so anything could happen, but it's hard to imagine how this show could miss the mark when it has done sooo well so far. Not one episode has disappointed, not one characters, not one scene, not one line delivery. I foresee this show becoming an all time best, and if it doesn't it'll be a crime. If you like K Dramas, I dont see how you can not enjoy this show even a little bit.",10
East Asia,I am in the middle of this Kdrama and can't wait each week for the next episode. The stars Hyun Bin and Ye Jin Son are such good actors but the supporting cast is what I really enjoy. His soldiers and Jung hy un keep me laughing in every episode. It gets you through the tense moments. Such good character actors makes the whole series great. I highly recommend this show.,9
East Asia,Can't give enough of it. I'm hoping they have a season 2 after ending the first season,10
East Asia,"Recommend giving this KDrama a try. It's an entertaining combination of fluff, romance, drama, and political/police procedural. The cast and characters they portray are engaging and fun to watch (even the ""over the top"" villain). Looking forward to seeing how the story will resolve considering the complexity of the North/South Korea situation. Can't wait for to the next episodes to air on Netflix.",10
East Asia,"One of the most well written and acted Korean dramas I have ever seen! The main couple have SO much chemistry and are such a good match despite their differences. There are multiple story lines and characters but they fit so well together. My favorite characters (besides the main couple) are the soldiers helping Captain Ri and the group of women from the military camp. So funny!The plot includes what life might be like in North Korea and it's fascinating! Power outages, hopping salespeople for when the train breaks down, strict dress/hair code, etc. They come from different worlds and it's interesting to see them each discover the other's world. Absolutely brilliant!",10
East Asia,"So far, the best kd i have seen. No idle moment! Superb storyline, best & good looking actors esp Hyun Bin. He's a total package! From head to toe, ooh la la especially when he smiles, with those 2 cute dimples! OMG he's oozing with sex appeal.. Oh Hyun Bin, muy guapito .",10
East Asia,"Writer Park Ji Eun has done it again. She has written a drama sure to be on the Top Ten Classics of KDrama list for a long time, right up there with her other mega-hit 'You Who Came from the Stars'. Brilliant casting, clever writing, side splitting comedy and a multitude of Easter eggs hidden everywhere put this right at the top of my top 10 Kdramas to date. This KDrama is as good as it gets It is what brought me to KDrama so many years ago. A must-see for all drama fans! Do not miss this one - a classic!",10
East Asia,"The drama is really amazing and the leads and other characters are just perfect .For the very first time, i really find some real chemistry between main leads .
They look really cute together and i really wanna appreciate the writer of this drama.
Hyunbin and son yejin both are really really good actors as they make me fall in love with their chemistry every time i watch them together.
This drama and our leads really deserve awards . Hope to see this couple (hyunbin and sonyejin)again in some dramas and best of luck to crash landing on you team",10
East Asia,"I'm in a very depressing situation at the moment. But, I tell you, viewers. This is something you wouldn't wanna miss seeing in the whole world. This drama is very inspiring! It makes you laugh, it makes cry. Like you can't just wait for the next episode. The main characters and supporting actors are AMAZING! Specially those 5 stooges. They are so funny! Thank you Directors and Producers, Cast for making this drama. IT'S THE BEST DRAMA I HAVE EVER WATCHED SINCE BOYS OVER FLOWERS.",10
East Asia,I would definitely recommend this drama to all of my families and friends !,10
East Asia,"So it's hard writing this review, as I'm not sure what K-dramas are meant to be... So anyone else new to this genre i'll summarise and you can decide for yourself.tonnes of unrealistic drama and gossip... think Home and Away if you are an Aussie or Britwoman gets constantly saved by guyset in North Korea and South Korea. Would love to know the research completed to show North Korea...they showcase the role of fate.. timelines and events seem a bit confused... did you take a pic of the couple twice, at different spots and both times think the other girl wasn't good enough? But at another time, on the same trip, you heard him play music and it changed you forever?Anywho, if you want a teenage drama type show that is easy viewing go for it or if you want to experience K -drama as a newbie like me",6
East Asia,"Fabulous love story. Yes it has all of the cliches of a K-drama with a woman and man, first disliking each other than falling in love, an evil and dysfunctional. Chaebol family, a jealous girlfriend but it is set in a most uncliched location, North Korea. Lots of action, laughter, intrigue and thrills. Hyun Bin is to die for as the intelligent, handsome, upright North Korean soldier. Son Ye Jin is the whip smart, beautiful chaebol daughter. Watching them come together is a joy to watch.",10
East Asia,This is my first kdrama and I have to say I absolutely love this show! I need 1000 more seasons of it,10
East Asia,"If you have been watching this show, you have cried at all the touching moments many times. I really love this love show. The MC's are both really endearing. A superb love story with a little suspense. It's not really about being realistic, it's about relationships, and fate of two people meant to be together.",10
East Asia,"Love love love this so far....The story is very well written and unique, having grow up in a communist country I was having flashbacks in a good way .. almost nostalgic.. from power cuts, to the school kids with the red scarfs around theirs necks .. too funnyThe cinematography and color grade of the film are outstanding. Setting (Sets) is outstanding tooThe cast ... all of the cast .. are absolutely outstanding. Hyun Bin and Son Ye-jin are the darlings of the k drama world and not without merit. kim jung hyun is so handsome , and the four guys playing Ri's subordinates are hilarious.
Actually this is the first korean romantic comedy I've seen where the humor is not lost in translation and I was able to get it.Netflix is up to the 13th episode now and I hope the ending is good because this far it's a total gem",10
East Asia,"After sometime i am addicted to a K Drama again. This story is full of surprises and most of all, every episode has a beautiful twist and we wait with suspension. The main actors Hyun Bin and Son Jin are great with their performance and bring the real two characters to life. Cannot think of any two other actors to do these roles.
The story line which takes place in two countries make you feel like there are two dramas within one drama and therefore there is no time to get bored.
All the other supporting characters do a great contribution in bringing the story to life and i believe this is a great masterpiece and i don't have any complains about anything by far.
It has all the components (thriller, Romance, Comedy) in exact right composition. Highly Recommend",10
East Asia,"All actors played very well. Especially the main actors are so cute together. The plot is not boring ,romantic and funny in all episode.",10
East Asia,U need to watch this yourself. Simply amazing. From the story to the actors. The comedy is just enough to keep you smiling in between.,10
East Asia,"It has many things going for it that will keep both men and women waiting for new episodes. The action, comedy, and drama all have perfect timing and the actors are all great at their craft. Sixteen episodes is not enough for this show!",10
East Asia,"SPOILER FREE Review!I am not Korean, so may be I don't notice all the Korean cliches. But that said, the series is beautifully shot in Mongolia, Switzerland and South Korea. Most episodes, and characters are well written, and one would easily fall in love with them.
It's light hearted, no references to sex or nudity and a lot of laughter with some beautiful romantic scenes. Also, it shows North Koreans as humans, am sure they are!",10
East Asia,"Ok, so this show is simply amazing. It has the perfect pace in the show. The reason i say this is because many K-Dramas tend to lag during the middle of the season to meet the 16 episodes they want to end at. Now this show literally doesn't lag it really all connects well and is intense and you just want too see the next episode NOW but have to wait a week on netflix for the next two episodes (its so hard to wait!). The two mains are absolutely perfect. The other actors in this show do so well too. You really get involved in the characters because they give a good background even to not main characters they at least give you something about them and you really care about the characters in this show and want too see more! Def a must watch! Do it watch it now!",10
East Asia,"Another korean drama that give me the vibe that hard to gain from other dramas. The chemistry, the plot, the cast, the place, the way they act, sooooo gooooooddddd!!! I really love this dramaa. This drama is freaking good. It has the feeling that hard to move on... And also become lot of peoples' favourite. I just don't want this drama to end...will be really missing them, all of the cast.",10
East Asia,I made an IMBD account just to write a review for this show. This is my favorite K-drama!!! The story line and the actors and everything about this show is brilliant. I was hooked 5 minutes into episode1!! There's never a boring moment. Love the mix of comedy and action and romance. I also like that each episode is well over an hour long. Easily rated 10/10!!!,10
East Asia,"I am more of a 13 Days in Benghazi kind of guy but this Korean Soap opera has me hooked the main actress is stunning, you will melt for sure. There is enough action to keep a guy interested.",9
East Asia,"This is my first time reviewing - and this is my first time watching Korean drama TV show - something I never thought I would enjoy having grown up in Hollywood, but I am Super impressed! The 4 main characters are perfect in their roles, and the supporting actors were great! I love the build up from the first episode all the way to the end. It has cute interactions as well as heartbreaking ones, and just an overall enjoyable drama in Korean. I started watching other Korean tv shows but none of them are as well made as this one, I highly recommend this if it's your first time watching korean drama and hope you enjoy it as much as I did!The story is about a South Korean smart lady boss who happens to come from a wealthy family and meets a North Korean soldier after accidentally being swept away in a hurricane. Both actors were great in their roles, although I find the female actor Son ye jin a better actor, the male actor Hyun Bin is quite handsome and cute in his role. The supporting actors are all quite good and thought the director did a good job - especially with the build up of the story. Hope to see this group of actors again whether in a second season, or in another tv show. Very well done!! Love the show!!",10
East Asia,Wish this drama was longer. Funny and cute. Really engages the audience to finish each episode,10
East Asia,"The characters and storyline was superb! Congratulations to everyone on the CLOY team!
If you're familiar of KDramas this is one of the best to watch and if you're new to it this will get you hooked!",10
East Asia,"What can I say about Crash Landing on You that hasn't been said already? For starters this drama belongs to the Premier Division of k drama IMO, in line with Secret Garden, You Who Came From the Stars, Legend of the Blue Sea. Not entirely coincidental these dramas were aided by respectively the same actor, Hyun Bin, and the same screen writer, Park Ji Eun. The question remains: what's so good about it? I think it is the right mix of story, actors & music.The StoryCrash Landing on You combines many proven genres that capture a worldwide audience from the start: action, romance, comedy, drama, tragedy, business, rags & riches. Moreover it is meticulously written according to the golden rules of screen writing:
1. Use the time of your audience in such a way that they will not feel their time was wasted
2. Give people at least one character to root for
3. Every character should want something, even if it is only a glass of water
4. Every minute must either reveal more of a character or advance the action
5. Start as close to the end as possible
6. Be a sadist. No matter how sweet your characters, make awful things happen to them to show what they are made of
7. Don't try to please the whole world, this only weakens your storyline
8. Give your audience as much information as possible in order to stay hooked.
The storytelling is also rock solid: boy meets girl - they get into trouble - things go from bad to worse - there is a closure but at the same time it keeps us from knowing if new developments are good or bad, hoping for a sequel.The ActorsEven well written stories are made or broken by the cast. In this case the acting of each and everyone was on point. I can't imagine any other actor playing the lead than Hyun Bin (the stern and sturdy North Korean army officer Ri Jung Hyuk) and Son Ye Jin (the sophisticated South Korean chaebol heiress Yoon Se Ri). Also the supporting cast did a great job, with honorable mentions for Yang Kyung Won (sergeant Pyo Chi Su who speaks North Korean to a T according to North Korean defector Kang Nara) and Bang Eun Jin playing the emotionally scarred mother of Se Ri.The MusicSo, we've got our story and the right actors, but the soundtrack is the cherry on top. No surprise this soundtrack leads the Top 10 of most downloaded OST's of ALL TIME at the moment I'm writing this review.RewatchSometimes I can forget a story as soon as the clue has been reached, but I think I will definitely rewatch this drama. There are many layers in the episodes that deserve a re-run.VerdictOverall, if you haven't seen this already, go watch it, and get in line with others who are longing for The Sequel.",9
East Asia,"""If you give up on waiting, the pain of loss will kill you. That's why I wait."" -Captain Ri.Most people who have watched the entire series, love CLOY, which is one of KDrama's finest series, for some of the following points:1. The writer, Park Ji-eun, who also gave us ""You Who Came from the Star"" is one of the best, knowing how to balance drama, comedy, themes, and closure while keeping her audience intrigued and in love with her characters. The director, Lee Jeong-hyo, who has worked on many series and movies, kept everything focused and carefully paced so that the series steadily evolved each week.2. The cast is one of the best I've seen with immensely beautiful and talented leads, warm, hilarious village ajummas, and Capt. Ri's delightful squad, dubbed ""the ducklings""-all of whom became a family for one another and for the viewers.3. Themes varying from the pain of losing family, being abandoned and becoming a street orphan all the way to the belief in a Zen appreciation for patience and waiting, also kindness, protection, sacrifice, and unconditional love. The themes drive the plot, and the cast brought everything to life, making us impatient for each weekend to finally roll around so we can see what happens next to our beloved characters, whether love, laughter, danger and heartbreak, we got on that train with them.4. A great story that keeps the reader interested, a love story whose premise was there from the beginning and revealed brilliantly in the steady epilogues. But also the comedy of the sidekick-and the horror of the bad guy consumed with envy and jealousy that destroys innocence and beauty, making this the classical struggle between good and evil embraced by every generation since time.5. The touching, beautiful OST, which many fans have downloaded. The piano piece ""Song for My Brother"" leaves me in tears every time.6. A wealthy, beautiful but hurt woman who learns to love herself as well as others, who can be hilarious and sassy, yet who finds strength in loving and protecting the most amazing man-Capt. Ri.7. A beautiful man, a pianist who becomes an army officer, a quiet philosopher and tomato plant caretaker with a ""low voice""-the kindest man I believe I've ever seen in any narrative-who adores the hurt woman, knows who she is, finds her, protects her, and loves her no matter what evil, what danger threatens them. Yes, he sounds too good to be true. . . . .but he's not. The whole world is in love with Capt. Ri because Hyun Bin developed him and made us believe that such a man can exist.",10
East Asia,I have watched a few Korean dramas in the past and they have been fine. This one however is endearing and well put together. The main actors have good chemistry and do a splendid job. The supporting actors are great too and well defined too. This is storytelling at its best. Watched every episode hoping for more. Hoping there's a season 2 because I'll really miss this series. Well done and thanks Netflix!,9
East Asia,Must watch k-drama of 2020.Storyline of drama is fabulous and all the character fits in their role . Its a must watch k-drama and one of my best k-drama,10
East Asia,"Just watch it. It's got beautiful cinematography, great chemistry between all the characters, tender and funny moments, as well as commentaries on both N and S Korean societies. So good.",10
East Asia,""" Crash landing on you "" was an excellent melodrama with a sweet romance.The first part of the drama was amazing. Sure, the first episode was a bit of a mess, as they were trying to fit in every back story in order to lead us to the big even of the female lead getting into North Korea by accident. And while we're at it, I would have liked if they had given a more in depth presentation of the main character's background and her relationship with her family, as the latter was a big part of her life and personality and a lot of twists were based on that rocky relationship.That said, the part where the leading lady was living in North Korea was really good. I don't know if the presentation of the country was accurate, but the one they gave us worked for the story. The romance had also a nice pace and it had enough intense and lovable moments. Yes, some of them were cheesy, but they were enjoyable. The side characters were adorable and they added a comedy element to the plot. The male lead had some funny aspects as well.Now, for the second part, it wasn't as good as the first part, but it was enjoyable. It had enough action and thriller to keep things interesting, and the side characters were simply pure entertainment. The second couple had some time to shine during the second part too, however, their ending was really disappointing, as it was rushed and not properly done.Finally, the settings and costumes were pretty good and the soundtrack perfect. The performances were really good from all the actors and actresses (this one was actually the only drama other than secret garden where I enjoyed the male lead, hopefully it won't be the last).So, overall, eight out of ten.",8
East Asia,"I always love to watch KDrama. It has been awhile since I last watched one with Hyun Bin as the main character.. I so love him ever since the Secret Garden days.. Crash Landing on You has a perfectly unique storyline, a love story through the barricades of the North and South. Bravo!",10
East Asia,"This is a top K show that we have watched in the past several years that fills your heart with joy, hope and humanity in each episode. It shows the humanity in all echelons of society, from poor to rich, from communist to capitalists, from military to playboy. The chemistry is incredible, the emotions are real, and the casting is perfect. Watching the show brings you the joy of being alive. Hats off to the director and entire team.",10
East Asia,I never thought I would like it but it was an amazing series.,10
East Asia,"Hyun Bin is a great actor. His onscreen chemistry with son yejin is amazing. Highly recommend. It is funny, touching,",10
East Asia,"If you are new to K Drama , you wouldn't understand the reference , however it is a very good show to watch. I started watching these just last year ( damn, they are addictive ) , but I have noticed they are becoming far more mature and less Cinderella like, which explains why a 50+ year old guy like me can watch them. A must watch.",10

East Asia,"This was my first Korean drama to watch, so I was not sure what to expect, as I watched it because Netflix kept suggesting it to me. The minute I started watching, though, I couldn't stop and binged on the episodes available till that date (13 episodes then!). The chemistry between the leads is amazing, and their acting beyond fantastic. As for the 'side' characters, for me they were an integral part of the series and not 'side' at all. On the contrary, they gave life to the story, especially the North Korean soldiers (the friends of Jeong-Hyeok), whether with their funny side or humane side. Most important though was the beautiful love story between Se-ri and Jeong-Hyeok, which made the first drastically change in character and the second go the extra mile and do what seems impossible to protect his love... let alone the love gestures he so silently offers to Se-ri (especially those shown in the last few episodes). All in all, it is well worth watching and rewatching many times. Definitely one of my all-time favs.",10
East Asia,"Wonderful story, beautifully directed, brilliant writing, and incredible film locations and scenery in every episode. Hyun Bin and Son Ye Jin were exceptional in their performance together. Their characters Ri Jung Hyuk and Yoon Se Ri coupled with their acting made for one emotionally compelling, heartwarming love story. Similarly, the story would not have been as powerful if it were not for the entire cast: they were all amazing! Bravo to this fabulous production! Netflix does it again with their outstanding Original K-Drama! Cheers to a fantastic viewing selection! Loved it!",10
East Asia,"The main couple was so fluid together, that when the series was over, I Couldn't really watch another rom-com because I missed Ser-Ri and Captain Ri. For a whole day I found myself simply staring out and catching myself thinking about the ending. A love beyond borders. Honestly, the entire cast was perfect. I don't give out 10 stars easy. The whole cast has me searching for their other acting projects. I was already familiar with both main characters though. Watch this show!! You won't be disappointed! It's on Netflix.",10
East Asia,"The last time i saw the full episode of KD was Whats wrong with Secretary Kim but this one made me fall in love with KD again. Every episode is full of twist and turns. The interesting part is how the story connects every little detail of an issue. The epilogue, the story about how destiny brought them together. It is such a wonderful story and yes just finished it with shedding a lot of tears.",10
East Asia,"If you have been frustrated by all the recent K-dramas that have been marketed as ""romance"" films just because they include some romantic content, I am pleased to report that this one is the genuine article. Yes, the plot is peppered with lots of suspense, action & comedy as well, but those elements always remain peripheral to the unfolding love story.Aside from being technically polished, this show also boasts a great (if understated) script and cast who were respectively endearing or despicable (depending on their roles). I also loved the layered backstories, deep friendships and various inter-dynamics among the characters. Plus, despite some bittersweet moments, the unconventional ending was happy and hopeful.And although this IS a romance film, I just have to say: THE COMEDY!!! Unlike many K-dramas which might get a chuckle from me with slapstick moments or exaggerated expressions, the humor in this show comes from hilarious culture-related misunderstandings, misinterpretations, shocks and awkwardness that left me in stitches. I nearly woke my kids up a few times because I couldn't stop laughing! And that gaming scene with the ""Memories of the Alhambra"" Easter egg nearly killed me. :DOf course there were some weak points. In particular, I thought many of the hand-to-hand combat scenes seemed a bit unrealistic and looked too rehearsed. There were also a number of scenes that were overly melodramatic, poorly executed or just outright impossible (the tandem paragliding scene, for example). But considering that this show is obviously meant to be a departure from reality, I can't really count these issues as faults. No film can do everything perfectly, right?In summary, if you like K-drama, are looking for a romance story that will make you laugh out loud, cry a little, and you don't mind having to continually suspend your disbelief, you should give this one a try. Highly recommended!ROMANCE RATING: 8.5/10
I thought Hyun Bin & Son YeJin had believable chemistry and they shared 5+ kiss scenes (very generous by K-drama standards!) The more serious kisses were also quite long, and fell somewhere between PG-13 & NC-17 for passion level. To be totally honest, I felt both Hyun Bin & Son YeJin's performances in this film were a bit too understated for my personal taste, but they still delivered when it came to the romantic parts, so it's all good! :)",9
East Asia,I strongly recommend all of you to watch this Korean drama,10
East Asia,"I've watched several KDramas now, most with a historical connection. This one takes place in the present, but focuses on a Romance and resulting conflicts between South and North Korea. There are tender moments, laugh out loud scenes and action sequences. The soundtrack (available on Amazon Music) has many haunting pieces that add a lot to the mood of the series. It is addicting",10
East Asia,"This is simply the most thoroughly enjoyable series I have seen on TV for years in any language. The comedy the romance and the drama are all successfully blended. Love the ongoing comedy about the differences between North and South Korea - all freshly done and spot on. Neither side is spared or treated unfairly. The farewells are heartbreaking and the romantic scenes are unforgettable. Many memorable scenes from the motorcycle rescue to his parents house. And the tightly constructed exciting story amazingly leaves no holes and has no red herrings while making use of the unique divide that exists in the peninsula. The Korean country side is idyllic and and so is the magical beauty of Switzerland.Hyun Bin is ideal as the North Korean soldier - can't think of another actor who could have been better and he has some truly standout heroic rescue and romantic scenes. Son Ye Jin is sweet and pretty and makes her character likeable and sympathetic - not annoying at all. Her range is impressive. The supporting characters are sympathetic especially the scoundrel Gu with a heart and seemingly cold fiance Seo Dan. The cute bunch of N Korean soldiers are all endearing and the evil and greed in the S Korean family members is painfully familiar.Hollywood hasn't been able to come up with anything fictional of this standard. The best series are based on true events and people like Narcos. Hollywood series have been dominated by worthy but depressing subjects like rape, suicide and racial injusticeYou will laugh cry and just be completely captivated. I wonder how they can ever top this.",10
East Asia,"On one of my nights of sleepless not filtering in and allowing me to catch some Zzzz'z I thought I would take ROKU and wake up Netflix. Now I know I am an old goat of nearly 68, when I layed eyes on Ye-jin Son, the Yoon Se-Ri character, I was smitten. Just a most gorgeous woman in these days pop creations bombarding us from all sides, it takes me to need a foreign movie to capture me and hold my attention for over 4 to 5 hours straight! I told my wife that she needed to watch Crash Landing On You. It is in Korean, but subtitles are well easy to read. This movie offers it all. Greedy siblings, a corrupt N Korean officer and some FANTASTIC scores being played. Well as luck would have it, I told my wife all I required her to watch was the first episode. Today was an off day for her and we took in 6 episodes. I am peppered with questions, and there is a new, rabid fan in our home. Too boot, the acting is much better than the pinheads we are used to in the states. Do yourself a favor. Take the one episode trick test and I guarantee you'll be hooked.",10
East Asia,"This was my first K-drama and it definitely won't be the last after watching this (hopefully they're all as amazing as this was).After the first episode I was hooked and after each episode I was desperate for the next one. All the characters are played perfectly and have real character development, so as viewers we're invested in them all, unlike other TV shows where its solely focused on the main two characters.This show had me laughing out loud and crying more than any other show and is a much watch for all who are after a bit of comedy and romance. Bit of eye candy with Hyun Bin too, so bonus!",10
East Asia,"The romance, comedy and action bits are just perfect! I downloaded the soundtracks, every song makes my heart aches. I have seen quite a few of KDs, so far RiRi couple has the best chemistry!",10
East Asia,"It has a very intriguing concept for a drama. The leads are top notch actors with great chemistry. The cinematography is splendid, leaves you in awe all the time. I just didn't like that they have not so interesting second leads and supporting actors and the ost are just played at almost end.",8
East Asia,"Very enjoyable series. Entertaining, romantic and moving. At times also funny. Great performances by lovely leading stars.",10
East Asia,"Sometimes the wrong train takes you to the right station. It was like that for me, too. I accidentally clicked on this drama on Netflix and just ended watching all the episodes. I am not a K-drama fan, tho. However, this drama leaves me with such an indescribable feeling. I was laughing, crying, thrilling, experiencing lots of emotions. I didn't know anything about North Korean and doubt it to be real until I watched this, I googled the information about the relationship between NK and SK, I saw how a North Koreans react to this drama. Wow, they actually well researched, the plot was excellent, the cinematography was so amazing, and don't forget the after credit scenes. Thanks to all cast, their chemistry was beyond everything. Usually, I would find some missing details after rewatching the movie/series. But this drama is exceptional, what I found was perfection. A must watch in 2020.",10
East Asia,"""Even if it breaks my heart because it's a dream that can't come true, I'd like to sincerely dream of the future.""I finished this Drama an hour ago and I am still just sitting here, not knowing what to do,...or to write, for that matter.
I am floored. My heart aches. I am happy and sad and amazed and grateful to have been able to watch this masterpiece. I honestly don't know where to begin. My heart is so full.""Crash Landing On You"" is a master class in screenwriting. The pacing, the revelations through flashbacks and unlinear storytelling, the perfect balance between tragedy, romance and humor,...and God, the characters!How is it possible to make each and every character of such a big ensemble so complex, relatable and loveable? I was so attached to every single character, that at some point I basically cried through entire episodes, because even when there were happy scenes, I kept thinking that things would probably not stay like that for all my poor babies. At any given time, while watching CLOY, I just had to think of the whole South Korea - North Korea predicament that they are all in and the tears started flowing.The scenes between Jung Hyuk and Se Ri are so raw and real that I often cried, as well. They say crying doesn't necessarily mean you're sad, it just means you are overwhelmed with emotion - no matter which emotion. And that's exactly how I felt. I was so overwhelmed that I cried when it was sad, romantic and funny.I cried buckets and buckets of tears but I also laughed so hard that my stomach was sore the next day. There are so many funny moments in both, North and South Korea, but I think my favorite was Se Ri's department store opening. I almost died laughing.As an aspiring screenwriter and filmmaker, I am deeply humbled by the masterful stroytelling and breathtaking cinematography. There are so many gorgeous settings, such as all the snow scenes, the night of the train break-down and all the scenes in Switzerland.I am Swiss and I've never seen Switzerland portrayed so beautifully. It made me fall in love with my own country, again. It was strange to see the tram I take every week in a K-Drama. It was strange to see the place I spent vacations as a child. It was strange to see the sights I walk past every day, and have them shown in a new light, looking at them through the eyes of these characters to whom Switzerland represents happiness and their own little paradise. Somehow, seeing some of these incredibly emotional scenes against the Swiss backdrop, made them even more emotional for me.I can't mention the Switzerland scenes without mentioning how perfect the OST is, especially ""The Song For My Brother"", ""Flower"", ""Sunset, ""Here I Am Again"", ""The Hill of Yearning"" and ""Photo of My Mind"", which are the perfect musical expression of the Drama's atmosphere and emotions.Last but not least, the acting is brilliant! I've loved Hyun Bin ever since ""A Millionaire's First Love"", and his on-screen chemistry with Son Ye Jin is out of this world. I am also very happy to have been introduced to Kim Jung Hyun, Lee Shin Young and Seo Ji Hye through this Drama.This drama touched the deepest parts of my soul and will forever stay with me!",10
East Asia,"I finally finished it, 16 episodes and more than 20 hours of total running time. I'm not a fan of Korean Telenovelas, but I decided to give this one a try because of all the hype and also I thought that anything related to North Korea should be interesting.And it turned out to be quite an amazing series. In fact the hardest thing I had to do was resist watching the next episode because once you start watching it, it's pretty hard to stop.I think the North Korean setting is what makes this series unique and great, and also what kept me going thru some cheesy scenes (this is, after all, a Soap Opera). The setting bought the viewers to an exotic, new place with strange customs, and at the same time allowed the ""Fish Out of Water"" Plot Device on both sides of Korea (a minor spoiler there).Aside from that the series is also very well made in terms of Script and Plot Twists. It initially starts out as a Romantic Comedy with incredibly witty, you-will-fall-out-of-your-chair-laughing dialogue, and eventually evolves into a Soap Opera Thriller towards the middle of the season with clever Cliffhangers at the end of each Episode.The pacing is fast, there are always a lot of things happening onscreen, and the Cinematography is amazing, especially the scenes in Switzerland which made the place almost look like heaven.My only reservation is that is a bit cheesy at times as I mentioned earlier, and also a bit too wholesome for me, which made it feel a bit too unreal at times. I mean, no-tongue kisses, really?And no sex, despite all those gorgeous people sleeping around in each other's apartments? I think they just wanted the series to be as acceptable for as wide an audience as possible.Despite that, overall I would say that this is no ordinary series, it is much better than much of what I have seen on Netflix so far. I think it is an Instant Classic, a Masterpiece that must be seen. Truly outstanding.",10
East Asia,"What a wonderful rollercoaster of a show! You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll even laugh and cry!. Beautifully written - great story and a great cast. Son Ye-jin stands out as the incredible lead as does Hyun Bin as the almost Jack Bauer esq. hero. In fact, the series has a bit of a 24 feel to it for some reason - but one with a lot of heart. The contrast between North and South Korea is like chalk and cheese, but also eye-opening to life in the North and I think they treated it very respectfully. Can't recommend it enough - don't let the subtitles put you off!",10
East Asia,I swear i need season 2 . I cant get enough with 1season only . I wanna see their twin girls . I want some make love scenes ... please .,10
East Asia,"Breathless during the whole series!
Probably one of the greatest Love Stories I've ever seen in my life!
So powerful, so innocent, so highly emotional!
Full of the differences between the two different states, which made it so engaging!
I am in love with this series!
The two actors were both so beautiful and great in acting, having high chemistry between them. Probably one of the best couples I've seen in TV series!
I am also in love with Hyun Bin! :)",10

East Asia,"Started off really well but it dragged out with very lazy ending (basically the last 7 episodes even), many unnecessary scenes. Couldn't get myself to be touched in the last episodes because of these tired repeated clichés and goodbyes. Plus they killed the best character and seodan redemption arc. Absolutely ridiculous.",4

The main actors has great chemistry <3 I am hoping for season 2.
You must watch this drama!!!",10
East Asia,"I really enjoy the language too!
The reality on N Korea is off, but that does not spoil the overall experience.",9
East Asia,"Lets get to the point, this series destroyed my heart, i need to re wire. It didn't matter whether the scene was happy or sad, i wad just crying. I never felt this attached and this emotional over any other kdrama i can say this one wasn't typical teenage type drama but it was one that adults also can relate with. It wasn't one girl many boy or one amazing boy with a girl less than him, It was forbidden love, something u can't reach not because of one side of love but because of the political situation. Aaaaah I can't even say how much i loved it. ( still crying )",10
East Asia,"My most unforgettable kdrama series. I love each and every episode. The soundtrack fits to every scenes. It is well-played and portrays strongly each and every emotions and feelings of the characters. Amazing plot which is far best than ""Romeo and Juliet"" romance. I never expected this kdrama being out of the ordinary melodrama and tragic plot. This is so balance. Anyone who will watch this series will not be left heartbroken but will feel hopeful and loved. It feels so good watching it.",10
East Asia,"I'm a sucker for romance, and this k-drama got me so hooked it's Insane.It can be a little corny sometimes with the typical K-drama, but that is also the charming part if you can embrace it.Sarangui Boolshichak is filmed in an different way with more of a non-sexual aspect. which i think it makes this Sarangui Boolshichak more beautiful.
It was humors, romantic, nail biting and intrigued of what will happen next.
The story is beautiful and the typical knight in shining armor never gets old.the chemistry is very good between the main characters.
I loved hyun-bin. and son ye-jin made a huge impact in the emotions part.Im gonna watch this another time with my girlfriend.",10
East Asia,Really engaging and fun to watchGive it a chance9/10,9
East Asia,"I only watched a few Korean drama movies and this is my first Korean Drama series but I enjoyed it a lot that I'm watching it for the second time. The cast, the action, comedy and drama, the soundtrack, the sceneries are all so good! It's an emotional rollercoaster ride!",10
East Asia,"I've never, ever watched a Korean show and this show just shook me to the core! The plot is out-of-this-world, truly original, and the acting is amazing!!!! I felt every feeling, I laughed, I cries and I can't get enough of it! It's way better than any Hollywood production. Just do yourself a favour and watch it!!!!",10
East Asia,"Kind of but not quite a Romeo and Juliet story, mixed with fantasy, satire, comedy, tragedy, murder, mystery, tension, wistfulness, and dramatic, fateful and improbable but entirely romantic coincidences; with observations on politics, societies, character, and allusions to Hollywood and other movies, eg., Pretty Woman, The Wizard of Oz.Characters and pretensions that are universal; this series is for the world. The 'hero' is the romance the captivating characters create (even the villains).Despite being subtitled (beautifully rendered), the series is entrancing. Probably even better if you understand Korean.Ten stars. Bravo.",10
East Asia,"Worth to watch if you need something light and romantic
Unforgettable drama with good acting.",8
East Asia,"At first I'm curious to what the fuss is all about with CLOY and now that I've watched it I'm honestly just dumbfounded. I've never cried like this on kdramas since Goblin, only this time it's almost every ep ?? The plot, acting/cast, and OST are all 10/10-not to mention the overall superb cinematography ??CLOY is now the second-highest rated kdrama on television history, beating Reply 1988 and Goblin (Well-deserved imho ????) No doubt CLOY would win numerous awards at Baeksang Arts Awards (which is like the Emmys of Korea)",10
East Asia,"For a KD to portray and pull off the North Korean culture and dialect deserves an award in itself. So many dramas fail to capture the depiction of North Korea in the positive sense of things, but this KD does everything in its power to show both the good and bad side of the country including the value of belonging in a community. The character development of both leads and supporting cast was also incredible to watch given no one outshone one another, and each character (whether their part was big or small) had an equal opportunity to tell their life story. Moreover, to unite the two Koreas by plotting a developing romance between two people with completely opposite lives and mantra was a genius idea. The energy and undeniable chemistry you felt from the screen b/w the two leads is honestly unmatched, and the fact that I cried in almost every episode goes to show how big of an impact most of the scenes had on me to feel the way I did.",10
East Asia,"The Best K Series I've seen to date I cant even stress enough how perfect the Plot, Storyline, Cinematography,Script and Set Design its like your watching a movie every episode..Aside from the visuals the Cast is on point their character build up, from.the smallest role made a vital part of the story. Every actors and actresses in this series will make you love them as if you are with them, you will laugh, cry, mad, frustrated, root and fall in love with them.. their acting skills will hypnotized you to their realm.The script will be embedded to your heart and will be immortalize as one of the great love story of all time.salute to the writerSon Ye Jin and Hyun Bin chemistry described as being off the chart is an understatement. Their acting as if its real. I never shipped a couple this much hope they will find love with each otherLet me say their OST alone is a masterpiece how clever it was perfectly place in every scene how it will add to the pain and the happiness. I dont understand the lyrics but damn feels and chills everytime.Never in my existence did I cry for a movie or series unless there is an animal involve in it. But watching CLOY...I cried river of tears. i cant even understand myself whyI know you might be hesitant to watch it because of how long every episode is but trust me you will be begging for more.It is once in a life time that we can enjoy this kind of masterpiece so give yourself a treat
100/10PS.: This series also tackles about depression and suicide which is very timely and relevant and you will learn that one's love sometime can save a life not by coincidence but with fate",10
East Asia,I am deeply impressed by the way they have portray their country and make in such a sophisticated way that no one can go without appreciating after watching a very inspirational drama. It fulfills all the parameter of a family season which we can watch with our whole family including children.,10
East Asia,Thank you. I will have this serie in my heart to the rest of my live.,10
East Asia,"It has been several weeks since I watched the last episode of Crash Landing on You and I am utterly shocked by how much I miss these characters. And not just the main characters whose chemistry was magical but all the supporting cast as well. They lent a depth and breadth to this tale--the good guys were endearing and the bad guys were classic. Caution: You will have to suspend judgement about a few circumstances but if you ever read Peter Pan, you will easily want to believe they can fly. Personal note: I started watched K-D's because I am 75 years old and wanted to keep my mind sharp by reading subtitles. I don't know if my mind is sharper but my heart is warmer thanks to this wonderful series.",10
East Asia,"Watched almost all korean drama and this will remain number 1 for me. All of family members age ranging 17-65 love this drama as well. See it for yourself and for sure ull love it as wellACTORS :main leads Hyun bin and Son Ye jin they have the skills and charisma to portray the role they played,they were the right actors to play the role they did. All the supporting cast are well chosen and also did a good job potraying each or their roleBEST CINEMATOGRAPY AND AWESOME SOUNDTRACKSDIRECTOR ,WRITER , Present it in a concise way with mind blowing scenes and heart fluttering moments .After finishing this drama . Im not watching anything not until 6 mos elapsed ,cause I cant move one .",10
East Asia,"This show is the only K-drama that could suck me in into the Hallyu (Korean wave). The story is amazingly compelling and stays with you long after you've finished watching, the main lead has incredible chemistry, the cast is solid and gives strong performance, and the settings (particularly the North Korean ones) are so detailed and well-illustrated. I cried, laughed, and swooned throughout the entire 16 episodes. Would definitely recommend watching!",10
East Asia,I had never watched a K-drama before but at the insistence of Netflix I started it and am I ever glad I did. This is a love story that manages to be sweet and funny and action filled and touching with an incredible balance! I have watched it too many times to count already and can see myself viewing it many more times. In this age of pandemics and bad news this is soothing and wonderful for the soul,10
East Asia,"I opened this account just to be able to let future kdrama viewers know that this drama will get you hook just after one episode! The chemistry between the 2 lead stars, Hyun Bin & Son Ye Jin is amazing! This drama tops The Notebook for me. Check it out, you will not regret it.",10
East Asia,"Excellent cast, acting and sound track! I have never watched a drama series that could make me cry out loud, laugh out loud and suffer withdrawal symptoms afterwards.",10
East Asia,"This is probably my MOST FAVORITE KDrama! Lead actors are so freaking amazing! Kilig (Filipino slang for romantic excitement) overload Super Love Hyun Bin! This man CAN REALLY ACT! I am so impressed of his performance! Ye-jin is great too! There's definitely undeniably chemistry between them, love blossoms seem very true :DThis is just simply amazing, i will watch it more once that's for sure!",10
East Asia,"The first half is unique and enthralling, an engaging and relatively realistic take on life in North Korea. However, I felt that the second half was an unrealistic portrayal of South Korea. What started off a Romeo + Juliet love story in an authentic Korean setting dissolved into an idealized political argument. The story is cute and the characters are lovable (which should be all that matters). But a small part of me feels that the show, which had such promise, fell into old traps and stooped closer to the manipulating behaviour of the North.",8
East Asia,"North Korea here is a bucolic slightly backwards place, no internet or smart phones, with good hearted folk. Oh sure some baddies to add some tension but the writers dig deep into the K-Drama trope drawer.",5
East Asia,"This is my favorite Kdrama so far and I've watched so many of them. Seriously so good! Words can't explain how much I love this show; I watched it twice in a week! partly because of the coronavirus quarantine... I didn't get bored the 2nd time and I saw some details I missed the first time! Anyway I hope there's a season 2, I want to see them have babies- twins! and live a long happy life together with gray hair!",10
East Asia,Ight so just finished dis and it's good. Y'all should watch it. According to most North Korean people who defected its pretty accurate except for some parts.,10
East Asia,Stories laid behind each scene are set up based on unrealistic belief of the S.Korean towards the North one. K dramas are well known for their Romanticism overlapped with impractically platonic love. The characters are so done with their roles but the fact that it doesn't help anything! This is just a stereotypical Korean film...,1
East Asia,"I have no experience of k-dramas, this is my first time watching one. But this show, wooow. So many emotions happiness, sadness, drama, longing, excitement. I laughed I cried and couldn't help but feel it with my heart. Even though the episodes are long it's not enough. Loved every second of it",10
East Asia,"This is my first k-drama series, and I just loved it from every perspective. The background score, acting, story and direction all falls in perfect place. I don't think it can get any better than this !",10
East Asia,"To be honest, for me Crash Landing On You is the best kdrama ever. I love every episode and it is the first kdrama that I attracted to. Hyun Bin(Ri Jeong Hyeok) and Son Ye Jin(Yon Seri) are the perfect couple and both of them really fit in this drama. I don't know what to say anymore, but I really love this kdrama. Finally, I hope to see season 2 of Crash Landing On You especially I hope the the director will fulfill the viewer's wish that this drama will have season 2. Thank you for the best kdrama",9
East Asia,I would have given this one 10 stars because I enjoyed this very much right up until the end. The ending imho was simply unsatisfying and left a somewhat bitter taste in its wake. Pity.,7
East Asia,"I'd never wanted to start watching Korea drama, until this series came out on Netflix. I started watching these series since ppl have been raving about it. And they were right, it's really good! I have been rewatching for about 4 times and loving every episode! It's really hard to move on from this drama. Simply because of the main casts, Hyun Bin and So Ye-jin, they played it so well!! Hope there will be another K-drama with these 2 adorable persons on it.",10
East Asia,"It's my first time watching a Korean drama but it has me wondering if I need to go to North Korea to meet someone like him :D
Loved every second of this amazing show.",10
East Asia,"I watched this at the time it was showing. I loved the acting, the cast made informed decisions and executed their role perfectly, the funny parts were quite funny and the serious parts were so very well done. I was always inexplicably happy after watching this. It was sweet and. had the right amount of romance + duty.",10
East Asia,"It is totally overhyped as people are saying this is the best K-drama they have seen in years.Have people gone mad or what ??
The story has absolutely no strength in this but the characters and the comedy atleast make it for a sweet good rom-com upto Episode 9 only.Consider that episde as an ending to the series.After that episode the series totally goes off the rails trying to include action and deus-ex machinas and irrational acts of characters.The series is just forcefully dragged beyond episode 9.The finale episode is ultimate cheese and fan service episode which is painfully long for 2 hours.I am first time K-drama watcher and I am really worried that if this is the standard for the K- drama fans to consider something as best ??",6
East Asia,"Crash Landing on you places its viewers in an emotional roller coaster and makes its viewers feel vivid emotions to bliss, anger and sadness. It adds its underlying political aspect as well, by promoting the union of the two Koreas just like the union of the main protagonists.",10
East Asia,"I watched it twice and enjoyed a lot, comedy scenes and the pure love and the situation of North Korea made me think and some how compare wit the country I live. Hyun Bin is one of my favorite stars from long time ago and I just become eager to watch the drama because of him but I found that Son Ye JIN is also marvelous. I f you watch it, you will enjoy it so much.",10
East Asia,I just love all the characters and cast.The story is also nicely written and directed amazingly.Must watch.,10
East Asia,"I enjoy ""Crash landing on you"" a lot. We have been tired with the sucks in real life, so for me watching movie is relaxing hobby, and this movie is definitly for that purpose. It brings some funny moments with rural neighbors, soldiers, friends, daily life of a mystery land - North Korea.
Strongly recommend!",10
East Asia,"This is a korean drama that I am glad i saved to watch whilst we are globally in lockdown. I know it will be good as I have seen some post in social media and some online review so I already have some expecations.Usually when you have good expectation you tend to be a bit disappointed when you didnt meet it. But this one did not disappoint one bit.
Characters in this drama are perfectly chosen. HYun Bin is dashing both in his military and civilian clothes. my gosh he is a delight to watch in all angles. His cold reaction is both endearing and manly. Son ye jin is a strong street wise woman that doesnt just cry and get scared in the corner. They have a very good chemistry that you would want to be put to reality. This is not a teen comedy drama nor any other drama that is over the top. This drama is a an adult kind of love that attraction started from the very first episode and Yoon Se ri has said that in a comedic way from the beginning. The risks they take to save each others lives prove the love they have for each other. The thoughtfullness that one has for each other is remarkable. You feel their pain and happiness and the difficulties they face for not being allowed to be together just because they are in a conflicting nation. The amount of times they say their goodbyes are all so painful that you would think it would always be their last time to see each other.
The supporting characters hyun Bin subordinates played their part really well. They show how a north korean would react to the many things that are just ordinary in SK but lacked in NK. The women villagers are overpowering in the beginning but it shows that the people in NK are just normal human being capable of showing emotions doing their day to day lives in a small village. I have done some researched after watching this drama and it says the lifestyle by the north korean depicted in this drama is true to what is happening in there and I would like believe that.
There are no loose end on this drama. Everything is very well explained as to what, how, why something happen. Which is what i love on korean drama. You will not have the urge to throw a glass to the Television screen in frustration which we sometimes feel in some hollywood dramas.
The writer is very clever that no one among the main characters ended with defection from each others country. They subtly choose Switzerland as a neutral country to stay. Brilliant!",10
East Asia,"This is a dramedy with absurd premisses. Very different from almost everything else we have seen, even though we watch our share of Korean movies and shows. The story is good and you'd be tempted to binge. But what makes this show shine are the great actors - we have laughed so much, cried so much, it is a rare gem.A bit of the acting is too much, as should be expected, and a few characters are quite one-dimensional. But it all comes together exceptionally well. Strong recommendation, especially good to escape the covid-19 crisis and all; immerse in this and fall in love with both main actors and their supporting cast.",8
East Asia,"I am from Holland and have watched the series on Netflix. So much better than any romance film or series, and I have seen a lot of them over the decades of my years.",10
East Asia,"This drama is interesting as much of it is in North Korea. The North Korean accent is well done, the living style is well done, the North Korean government is also well done.However many parts of the drama are unrealistic:
-Son Ye Jin comes into North Korea after being sucked into a tornado. It makes zero sense that she survived the tornado while paragliding with no serious injury, and only had some cuts and bruises.
-The attitudes of the North Korean army members are too soft. It is unbelievable that there are so many nice guys.She had a different accent the whole time and no one found that suspicious. Even if she is a secret agent in SK she would still not forget her North Korean accent.-The selling of SK products at the market seems too easy. IN NK people are known for getting killed in such situations, so even people from the army buying those products are too unreal.",4
East Asia,"Now, I don't know what to watch next because this one is definitely good. It gave me feelings and still this drama is in my head. Worth-watching.",10
East Asia,"I love this show so much! I created an IMDB account just to rate and review CLOY.I usually don't watch Korean dramas, the last one I watched and got obsessed with was A Moment to Remember (2004). I really love the actress Son Ye-Jin, she was one of the reason I gave this show a try.The first episode got me instantly hooked; the amazing chemistry between the lead actors, breathtaking scenic backgrounds in Switzerland and Mongolia (suppose to represent North Korea) and soulful music. Actually not to mention the dramatic, action and funny scenes. You cannot help it to fall in love and relate to each character. In times of adversity and change this show really lifts me up and makes me feel like a teenager again. I never thought a show like this would provoke different emotions I had as a blissful teenager back in the days.Please watch this show! You will not get disappointed.Much thanks to all the people who were involved in this production. You added some corniness in my life.P.s. the OST song Sigriswill is sooo dreamy, serene and full of blissfulness!",10
East Asia,"Hey, I'm not into Korean drama and I hate crying over sentimental scenes but this drama put me into uncharted territory. I couldn't imagine myself crying almost every episode but this one got into my nerves. The soundtrack is also very superb and well-made. The actors are very talented and there are a lot of funny scenes mixed with sentimental scenes. You'll fall in love in the first episode and will keep falling until the end. Good job producers for having this kind of show. It is really amazing. Love, love, love it..",10
East Asia,I really amazed of captain ri and se ri love chemistry since 1st to last episode.both of them are amazing ??,10
East Asia,"First of all, the actors didn't just act but lived the characters. This is the perfect mixture of all kind of emotions. The more we watch the more we will get immersed in the story. The affection and love among the characters, every gesture of the characters either will make you smile or cry. The more we watch the harder it will be to watch the last episodes knowing the pain that the characters will go through. I thank the team for making me cry. It is and will be one of my all time favourite.",10
East Asia,"Had me on the edge of my seat in every episode.
Was waiting for the next weekend with the patience of a child.
The title might be cleche, but it delivered so much more than just smoke and mirrors.
It was amazing to see the characters grow to care and depend on each other.
The stakes are real and the serendipity added in between was done in a fresh manner that tugged at your heart strings.
If anything, it closed the rift between north and south a little bit. It introduced us to lives not telling us that the one way of life is better than another. It didnt make one particular nation evil and the other good.
What it has managed is to show us that people are what makes a place, regardless of what you have or where you are in the world.",10
East Asia,"This is one truly amazing shows out there and I would recommend it to everyone. It truly has to offer something for everyone. From Prefect direction to Flawless acting by the cast and scenario saturation, it was a delight to watch. The show is partly based in North Korea and they have beautifully captured the culture and practices. The overall tone of the show is Happy and romantic which makes you feel good. I am super impressed with Lead actress Son Ye Jin, her acting is flawless. I was not sure earlier about Hyun bin, but he is also so good. And kudos to rest of the cast. I don remember their names but deserve mention.
Overall, this show was one delightful addition in my growing Korean shows list. Would recommend to everyone.",10
East Asia,"I started crying at episode 7 and I am crying even more now that I have finished it. It is a great love story, funny, sad, romantic, never boring story. The actors are also great!",10
East Asia,"The best romantic series ever!
The way they connect the moments was the best part of the series.
And such a strong acting from every cast member.
The only series that I watched in any other language by viewing the subtitles!",10
East Asia,Probably the most overrated k-drama of all time. I don't get the hype surrounding this drama at all. It was pretty lame and boring,1
East Asia,"I have read dozens of novels and short stories, hundreds of movies, series etc. yet I never felt the way I did when I watched crash ...The strange thing is that it reminded me of Geme of Thrones! The common element between the two is the little details. Every small detail has its own significance and aim. The small unimportant charecters sunddenly play a crucial role in the story! The cast are just wonderfull.It is not just a romantic story like many other series. No. It also highlights the sad political fact of seperating lovers, families and friends between the two Koreas in a remarkable manner. Words cannot describe how great it is and the best word I can think of is bravo.",10
East Asia,"This movie compare north and south korea different,
made me reflect now live in city is so lucky.Love Hyun Bin & Ye-jin Son interaction between the two.
Beautiful scenes - main scene in swiss lake, play piano at pier.
Love song -yoon mi rae flower",8
East Asia,"This TV series was amazing!!! Loved every moment of it! The actors and directors did an amazing job, you really feel apart of it!! Great mix of comedy and romance. Definitely recommend!",10
East Asia,"This show is a flawless masterpiece. The storyline, screenplay, performance, direction - everything is top notch. And the chemistry between the protagonists is just unbelievable!!! It is not everyday that such shows are produced-probably once in an era. It is an absolute pathbreaking TV series. I guess I will switch off my TV for a few days to keep the warm feeling a little longer. Thanks to the entire team for delivering such a brilliant piece of art!",10
East Asia,"Top notch acting. Great characters. Can make even the coldest of hearts to flutter! At the end of it. You'll walk away with a smile on your face. My first korean drama. Glad I watched it. Was very skeptical to begin with and had low expectations. My oh my, was impressed with this show. Do watch it.",10
East Asia,This is one of the best k-dramas I've watched. Hyum Bin and So Ye Jin have this amazing chemistry that really takes you by storm! Is the ultimate love story of fate! A must watch!,10
East Asia,This story is like a beautifully intertwined hairbraid. Hyun Bin and SJY looked great together. Supporting casts were very delightful. Nothing that I can complain about this drama. I'll watch it again definitely.,10
East Asia,"I have watched C. L. O. Y. in netflix in early March due to the lockdown but my teenage daughter was pestering me for a month to watch it but I totally regretted it, since I fell in love with Hyun Bin and Son Ye Jin soon after. I've never been a fan of KD before but after CLOY I couldn't moved on. Their undeniable chemistry, superb casting, romantic scenes, myriad of emotions, brilliant director and cinematography, and the suitably perfect story/script! I wished TVN and Netflix will consider a part 2 or a new project for HB and SYJ considering the 1+ billion views of CLOY worldwide! #RiRi #BinJin",10
East Asia,"I finished the show a while back but I just had to make an account to say just how good this show is.The two main leads are amazing, the two back up leads are amazing. The storyline is just amazing. A wonderful OST. Words doesn't do this show justice. Even if you aren't into KDramas, please just watch this show and you'll see it's just as good as any other show.Ever since I finished this show, I've just been on a continuous binge of watching Korean shows and i can honestly tell you, nothing comes close to it.But I'm also grateful because watching Crash Landing On You has opened up my love for Korean shows and now I just can't get enough of them.",10
East Asia,"I did on n off watch Korean drama since ""steps to heaven"", ""im from stars"", but these years many Korean drama did disappoint me until watching this one. It just melt my heart and the charm of this movie really make me return to 17 yo again. It didn't make you cry heavily but feel sad and warm the same time. The scenery in Swiss is amazing but most importantly the storyline is up to the standard and not waste the money spent in filming aboard. Some drama just film oversea but the story didn't good enough, it's a waste. I would think of the story end in the way using reunification of south and north years after for the leading actor n actress to meet again. If it is so, I think this drama will be more controversial and draw lots more attention. Even it end that way, it's very good enough for the whole series and very laughable for many scenes as well.",9
East Asia,"Everything about this Kdrama were so easy to fall in love with. The beautiful story, magnificent scenery, heart touching soundtrack, and the chemistry of main characters Captain Ri and Yoon Se Ri makes your heart melt.",10
East Asia,Loved and enjoyed watching the movie so much. Perfect chemistry. Captivating story line. Beautifully directed. Great actors and actress ?,10
East Asia,"This is up there in my favourite list, it's a fairly unlikely story with a lot of laughter, suspense, cheese, drama, hilarity and some very good actors. The showing of the differences in the two worlds of Korea in a very respectful, human way was lovely. While we all know the differences, the daily lives of these people are still the same - food, love, family and work. It's a shame the world is the way it is, but essentially we're all after the same thing and whether you're rich, poor, powerful or midway, the feels are still there. I only wish the mean fiancee had fared better, but even her ending was reasonable. Watch this, even just for the eye candy and funny moments like the young guy getting all the mysterious business cards from random people :)",10
East Asia,"Son Ye Jin and Hyun Bin are two of my favorite actors, but I am now at episode 9 and can only watch it with the fast forward button.
The episodes are way too long, the evil doer are overacting/overacted, lots of impossibilities (tornado and no broken bones,...) and I see no chemistry between the leads. When I think about Son Ye Jin in ""something in the rain"" with her co-star....I would have believed they date for real!
I think I spend my Corona-isolated Easter holidays with something else.",6
East Asia,"Like others shared, one of the best Korean dramas ever. The writing (it is just soooo good) and OST, actors, just so amazing.Highly recommend! <3",10
East Asia,I love the plot and the intrigue! The actors play remarkably well as if the have a real chemistry outside the series. I would truly recommend this series for anyone. It's fun and dramatic in the same time.,10
East Asia,Sweet romance story and brilliant humour throughout,10
East Asia,"I don't think I can ever get over some scenes from this drama (especially Hyun bin and sonye-jin last goodbye from episode 15), cried like a baby and I don't regret it.",10
East Asia,"This story is really, really good and I highly recommend it. It's a complete story because it has it all: drama, romance, action and comedy. It also has a very good cast, with very beautiful women. Without such a cast, the scrip would never have been put in value so well. :)Personally, I related to the story even more, having been born in a former Communist country. So almost everything presented in the show looked very familiar. In reality, some of them were even worse than in this show, but the writers did a pretty good job introducing them in the story without having to shock the audience.",10
East Asia,I liked these drama. I mainly watched this drama because of the high anticipation and reviews. But I don't think it's as good as dots or goblin.I liked the 2nd couple more than the lead couple. So I DON'T THINK the 2nd male lead had to die. There was no basis in his death. I mean the main lead took so much risks. He even escaped to another country to keep his girl safe and not a single thing happened to him.??????I also hated the fact that Gu seung joo's death was not mourned by any. Not even the lead actress(he was her ex fiance and helped her go back to south korea). I think his last death scene(where the seo dan was taken as hostage) was not well written. It seemed like the writer wanted to finish this as fast as possible.The humour was great especially after they(Hyun bin and his comrades) escaped to south korea. Tbh I really liked the 4 comrades. They were awesome. It's because of them I could complete this show.,7
East Asia,"It's such a great romantic comedy and the actors are so good. I laughed when they laughed, i cried when they cried. First i was not sure that i want to watch this movie but i am sooo glad i started it...after the first minutes of the first episoade, i couldn't leave it. I surely recommend it. I'm a little sad that it ended, i would definetly watch more seasons of it. And the end it's partially sad from my point of view... I mean they lived the rest of their lives being together only 2 weeks per year? But it's super great anyway. I started watching movies with Hyun Bin now ?? and Ye-jin Son.",10
East Asia,"When I finished the show the first time, I immediately started on the first episode again; on the same day! Besides the main aspects of the show, all the other aspects, minor or otherwise were so well done!
The dialogue, the scenery's, the supporting plots etc etc. You would fall in love with the supporting characters for sure. You would remember the dialogues almost instantly. You would hit rewind just to see the set and scenery again.
Love that all the other major plots that are interlinked into the main love story are so well thought of and executed!
Planning to watch for the third time again!...... And maybe the fourth!",10
East Asia,Beautiful story...like they say..it was destiny that seri and captain Ri met...beautiful and happy ending.,10
East Asia,"I seldom write my reviews and comments but for this K-drama, I can't let it pass by giving it a perfect 10 in all aspects...This is the 3rd K-drama I've watched...first was Kingdom which is also very good, then The K2 which is just as watchable....but mind you, this K-drama is something different from all the shows and movies I've seen.....The story is somewhat un-believable but also possible to happen...the plot is so complex and it goes deeper and heavier every episode that you want to complete and know the ending soonest. The 2 main stars are so good looking, lovable and their pair has great chemistry...The many supporting casts added spice to the show....if not them providing the humor, it will be all tears and crying for the whole 16 episodes which may be too hard to handle. There are also some action and suspenseful scenes that really made the show complete. I quite find the last episode too long though that dampened all the hysteria...This is so far the BEST TV Show I've seen...",10
East Asia,"The best kdrama I've ever watched, hoping for a season 2 ??",10
East Asia,This is a very good moving series. I hope that the South Korean organization will put them in USB and fly the balloon over the border. These series will destroy Kim's regime much faster than we can imagine.,10
East Asia,"What a stunning performance delivered by versatile actress Son Ye Jin and handsome Hyun Bin. They really have a good charismatic chemistry. Casts were spectacular and they are all geniuses with their roles. I definitely admire how they portray about love for family, relationships, friends, subordinates, country, etc.. This is an example that your hoping in some scenes if only... I numerous cried with them, laugh with them and fear with them, what a moving scenes from Episode 1-16. I finished the whole series in 2 days. It is also a reminder that true love really happens. Kamsahamnida!!! xxx",10
East Asia,"I have seen a lot of TV shows over the years. While there are now more quality TV shows than ever, I more an more gave up, that a show will come along, that will get a spot in my top ten list. This show does.At moments I even thought it will reach the top spot, occupied since 15 years by Farscape. Just a few boring moments, overly constructed events and a few other little problems in the last few episodes hindered it to become my no. 1.But make no mistake, this is one of the best TV shows ever created.
The cast is awesome. From the smallest role up to the two main Actors. Especially Ye-jin Son is just perfect.Story, visuals and music are very well done. Very interesting scenario and story, beautiful locations and songs, that you want to hear over and over.If you like shows, that have a little bit of everything and especially a lot of emotion, this one might be for you. Most of the time it's very romantic, funny and dramatic.",9
East Asia,"I am not a big fan of Korean drama
. However this is stunning. I keep watching it and finished just in 3days. Two lead actors are stunning and the story is out of the world it is totally brand new.I hope to have season 2 even if there is no plan.",10
East Asia,"Absolutely fascinating mixture of comedy and drama, action and romance. Chemistry between the leading characters works perfectly, makes everything believable, while one can only enjoy immensely the subtle humor and the irony surrounding the overall conflict of two completely different lifestyles and cultures.",10
East Asia,"I LOVE THIS SHOW! I can only echo what everyone is saying about this series. The superb cast, the clever and heart-rending story had me on the edge of my seat for 16 binged episodes. My face hurts from smiling and crying so much.My only complaint is a technical one--the non-existant and quickly-disappearing subtitles although the acting was so good I could figure out the story as anyway.",10
East Asia,Strange title since it has its oen english title see netflix. Searching for Korean drama english gets more difficult every time. Too bad.,2
East Asia,Already lockdown and now with all the free time in the world i just want to re-watch this series but also it making me feel so empty that I just don't want to.??,10
East Asia,"Thankyouuuu for the movie!!!
create the season 2,please !",9
East Asia,"Inspired by true events of a South Korean actress and three others that had to be rescued when their leisure boat crossed the maritime border between the two Koreas, we follow Se-ri's escapades as she tries to go back to the South when a freak tornado unexpectedly lands her in the North. Captain Jeong-Hyuk, compassionate to a fault aids her even it means risking his life and that of his loved ones. Their misadventures of almost always getting her out only to be thwarted unexpectedly forces them to live together and they start to develop feelings for each other, even if it goes against every fiber of their being.Aside from the obvious elements as to why the show was a huge success: good-looking leads, star-crossed lovers, great supporting cast, and idyllic locales (both Mongolia as a stand-in for North Korea and Switzerland), the other contributing factor is the reversed rags-to-riches storyline of Se-ri adjusting to the North Korean lifestyle, giving us a glimpse as to how life is in a country that for the most part has been concealed to the rest of the world. The show had helped from NoKor defectors to depict as much accuracy as possible to the details presented. One criticism given is the romanticizing of the North, normally depicted as the villains in pop culture, while others agree the show gave them the right degree of humanity given the circumstances. I lean more towards the latter, but it is of note that the show also gave the impression that only the Southerners are interested in reunification while the Northerners are completely fine on their own.Hyun Bin was charming as Captain Ri and Son Ye-jin was believable as the strong and independent Se-ri. They had palpable chemistry and the only criticism I have is that the villain Cho Cheol Gong's arc was too prolonged which they could've shortened to give the two more scenes together while in the South. I mean we all felt sorry for Captain Ri when his gaming time was reduced, we needed more cute moments like that. Seo Dan as one-half of the back-up couple for me was more imposing than Se-ri and we should see more of the actress Seo Ji-hye in the future. All the other supporting casts were memorable most notably Ri's troops, Se-ri's assistants and the women of Ri's village.Lastly some takeaways from the show: A.) Martial Law or any form of government run by the military doesn't necessarily equate to a better government. As seen many times over, it is prone to corruption as even Captain Ri bypassed protocols and favors were thrown around incessantly. B.) Love cannot, and should not be hampered by any man-made laws (this includes arranged marriages, or discrimination against religion, race and same-sex relationships.) Their arrangement of meeting yearly for a limited period may be less than ideal, but love wins and will always find a way. There is no right or wrong way to love, only that love is unconditional.",8
East Asia,"Where was I till now? Why didn't I ever try any Korean Drama? Why didn't I know about Hyun Bin?
This is my first ever K-Drama and I'll be honest here. I loved it. It's a beautiful, heartbreaking, and an excellent series. Everything is amazing - Story, Main Leads, Their Chemistry, Acting, Thrill, Action Sequence, Star Cast, Background Score, Music. I completed this series in 3 days and I am suffering from Post Drama Syndrome now. I can't get over it. After completing this series, like everyone else, I am searching everything about CLOY on YouTube, Google.This is such a series which will never leave you. No matter how hard you'll try you can't forget it. You'll fall in love with all the characters, be it Captain Ri Jung Hyuk, Yoon Se ri, Gu Seung joon or Park Kwang beom. They all justified their characters and got immense love from viewers. You'll cry with them, laugh with them and start feeling their pain & emotions.And what to say about Hyun Bin and Son Ye Jin chemistry. It's magical. You'll start rooting for them. Hyun Bin was Rustic and Rough in NK but Classic and Dashing in SK. He can be tough and cute at the same time. He totally nailed his role and I read that he learned Piano for this role. Son Ye Jin was a great choice for the role of Yoon Se Ri. She played her role as a helpless SK Woman in NK and a strong, confident businesswoman in SK. I especially loved her character development.I have fallen in love with CLOY. And I am definitely going to watch other K-Dramas now. And this is my first ever review on IMDb. I created my account on IMDb to let South Korean people know that I have fallen in love with your country, your culture, your actors, and film industry. Lots of love from India! This series made me feel like visiting South Korea and having some friends from that land in my life :) Lots of love!",10
East Asia,"Their story of love, the love and genuine support their families and friends is just heartbreaking. I've never in my life been so touched by anything. And omg not to mention the cinematography, soundtrack, casting and plot. The idea of a realistic Romeo and Juliet type scenario is captivating and beautiful. Watch it, cry to it. 11/10.",10
East Asia,"Absolutely captivating story, beautiful places, touching scenes and an amazing chemistry between the lead actors. I loved it. Still crying.",10
East Asia,"This is phenomenal. I made this account just to write this review. It's a combination of humor, tension and flirting all over the episodes and it never gets boring. Please give me more! With love, from Belgium.",10
East Asia,"Simply not possible not to like it.
Its captivating, combines action, romance, family issues, political matters, true feelings, emotions, dreams and disappointments.",10
East Asia,"This is my first ever korean drama and I am glad I chose this. I don't have words to explain how I felt watching this series. You need to witness the magic on the screen. It had everything. Emotions, Perfect main couple, annoying antagonist, great side characters and their struggles. I loved it would be an understatement. This was the second time I cried watching a tv series after the red wedding in GOT. More people need to watch this amazing story. The only flaw I found was that every episode was almost the length of a movie but it's not like I didn't enjoy it. I wouldn't even call it a flaw coz I prefer series with shorter episodes.",9
East Asia,"I would never thought a K-Drama could have so much impact in my life. The plot, the actors, the places, the chemistry, even the OST makes this series an absolute masterpiece. I have never cried that much over a series. CLOY made it to my TOP 5 of all time. Absolutely addictive. I thought everyone was very close to me and I was so sad when it finished.",10
East Asia,"Rating - 8.5/10
Review -
This drama was great from the beginning. The actors are all amazing from the ML to the support characters.
The plot had the right dose of rom-com, heartwarming gestures,dialogues and action.
ML and FL watching them come together is a joy to watch.
'Crash Landing on You' should be on everyone's 2020 kdrama watchlist. Strongly recommend!
#Netflix #kdrama ????????",8
East Asia,I have never seen K dramas before and this was my first one. Loved every bit of it!,10
East Asia,"I was between giving it a 8 or a 9 but I guess I go with a 9 because even if it was not completely my style, it still was a very good KD.
I would have liked a little bit more action and happier ending. The idea of them meeting just 2 weeks per yeat in Swiss made me very sad. It also bothered me that the con artist died... Why? He was a very good man in the end. It was the only moment during the movie when i cried. It would have been better to leave him alive.
Besides than this, the differences betwen North and South are so well displayed. It made me search the internet more about North Korea and see if things really are like that. Good job for the story writer.",9
East Asia,"I landed on CLOY by accident, a tip on a french site. I am still shocked after having watched the full serie in a few days,
The whole thing works, the alchemy between the actors, the story line, the unexpected twists, the non standard story telling, the humor , the slow pace focused on the emotional rollercoasters of the different heroes.
The further it goes, the most unbelievable sweet it turns into, that I would normally switch to a different program, but you can't escape it, You get into the Korean story line, the obvious dilemmas in the relationship that 's building up and up.There should not be a second season, the end is what it is, but it will remain one of a kind TV impact for me, as I experienced ""the breakfast club"" a long time ago. I have not been kept awake by a TV program before, so strange. Very grateful to have seen this.And I guess that the Swiss Tourism office will see a massive increase of Korean or CLOY whenever the lock down has been raised.",10
East Asia,"Well written, edge of you seat show. Has everything from drama, romance, comedy and action.
An excellent K Drama that brings life in North Korea to the screens",10
East Asia,"I loved everything: the story, the music, the actors, dialogs, a fun. Everything. I really enjoyed it from the first minute. They even made me cry several times.",10
East Asia,"Last K drama I watched was princess hour. In my late 30s, I was told by EVERYONE of my friends and workplace colleagues to watch. After a struggled to watch and reluctance many weeks, one episode, bang, here I watched continuously for 2 days. Until now, I still kept repeat watching for tenth time. The palpable chemistry of both actors could exploded whole North korea, albeit there was very small intimated love scenes. You kept watching laughing, smiling, picking your pillow and crying whole boxed of tissues in one episode. Probably one drama like this in ten years time.
The Romeo Juliet love story like this could not be felt if not the superb acting on both protagonist actors. I hope they will get many awards and some chances to perform in Hollywood series one day.",10
East Asia,"I finished watching this show two days ago, and I just can't get it our of my head. It feels like I have a broken heart. So I had to make an IMDB account in order to write a review to this surprisingly impressionable show. Maybe it will help my grieving process.The show is well balanced, and takes you through a huge reservoir of emotions. I've cried and laugh, felt fear and joy. At the beginning I wasn't all that sure. In the first episodes I thought the story seemed to predictable, and at times whimsical. But boy was I wrong. After two episodes I couldn't stop watching. I finished the entire series in three days.The main characters have captivating stories, and the actors are able to portray thoughts and emotions in a superb manner. Even though I couldn't understand the language, I felt like I could.The script is well written. There is no unnecessary dialogue, the character say what is needed. And nothing is over explained. The main plot has many layers, and I catch myself thinking back at different moments in the storyline more than once during the day. The side stories give you a glimpse of the lives of ordinary people in a country far different from my own. Even the seemingly dim neighbors get a special place in your heart. The acting is superb. The mimic of some of the supporting actors seem a bit dramatic at first, but somehow it just fits. Everything feels natural, something that is often lacking in Hollywood productions. The main cast are able to give us a nuanced portrait of human emotions.I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll stop here. All I wanted to say was: WATCH IT.",10
East Asia,"It was a long time that I had not watched K-drama before watching this drama and I must say I made a right decision. This drama packsgreat scenery: the color and atmosphere are so soothing in Swiss that you wish you could be therelaughs and humor: unpredictable punch lines are not scarcebeautiful love story: you will smile /cry happily and swoon for the couples' cheesy momentsplot full of twists: this drama is not some kind of bland linear story. Its story has depth and meaningmany more: hot actors and actresses, funny supporting characters and lots of moral and life lessons delivered in deep and gentle waysJust watch it and you will have a good time",10
East Asia,"What a rollercoaster of an experience. The absolute best romantic drama I've seen to date. Nothing much to say, just watch it. It will forever be etched in your memory.",10
East Asia,"I never understood the global appeal a d popularity of K pop music, dramas and frankly, would have been ignorant if I hadn't given it a try. Netflix happened to be promoting this new title and I enjoyed the trailer...peaked my curiousity and wanted to see more.
I was hooked by the first episode - the witty script, dialogue, music, songs, cinematography and the palpable chemistry not only between the leads but the whole cast - it really caught me pleasantly off guard!
I have and continue to binge watch - since mid february till now (first week of May), I have completed seven K drama series! Am on my eighth one now.
I do have a clear favourite actor - Hyun Bin and pretty sure, many other talented names will be added to this list.
In lockdown, good opportunity to get 'pop cultured'!",9
East Asia,"I watched the first episode of this one back when it first started to play on Netflix. After that, it wasn't until the full series was available and had been for a while that I went back and watched the rest of the show.I really enjoyed the show, whose two main stars I have seen in other shows that I also loved. It was quite slow moving, but had plenty of tension, action and laughs along the way. The way it ended was interesting, as I guess it was quite realistic - but also would you want to live your life like that? Well, I guess it's better than nothing right?Anyway, I'm not sure how much I can take as gospel the information gleaned about life in North Korea from this show, and I'd never presume to believe I'm now an expert - but it was still interesting to get that insight.I loved all the supporting characters as well as the main hero and heroine. This show might not be one of my all-time faves, but it's one I may watch again someday, so I'm calling it a good one. :)",8
East Asia,"Perfect. Just perfect--- the cast, the storyline, the scenery, the chemistry of the two leads. This drama gives you the all in one package. You will cry now then laugh later. You begin to see how great it is to be loved and to love someone. Love, indeed, has no boundaries. For me, this is my best Korean drama of all time. I will surely be watching it over and over again. It touched the hearts and minds of almost all the people around the world despite of the pandemic. Will be forever a fan of CLOY even years from now.",10
East Asia,This is as good as any other love story made. Loosely based on an actual event where the writer got helped from locals(probably dead now in the hands of Kim) after their boat landed in NoKo during a storm. Watch,9
East Asia,"I cannot count how many times I re-watch this drama. Maybe it has been for a long long time I didn't watch any Korean drama, because anytime I start to watch begining episodes, I wouldn't like to continue for watchibg this dramas. So, I didn't watch any drama from that time. But ""Crash Landing On You"" is the difference. I was attracted by this serrano. Yoon Se Ri and Ri Jung Hyuk always know how to push my feeling to climax. So funny and also so touched. I don't know how I could use words to describ. But, you shall not be regret to watch ""Crash Landing On You"". I am sure.",10
East Asia,"I watched this during a vacation on Tet Holiday in Vietnam. This is the best K-drama in 2020 in my opinion <3 I appreciate their beauties, their acting and their connection in drama, in BTS and in real life. When I watched this drama, I smiled, cried a lot. No words can describe how amazing this drama is ~ Must watch!!!!",10
East Asia,Just made IMDB account to write a review for this series. You can't take off your series while seeing this series. From the smile of jeong hyeok to the cuteness of se ri everything is just lovely. Beautiful potrayal of both the countries. 100 hearts to it <3,10
East Asia,"If there is only one drama you have to watch in your entire life, it has to be crash landing on
you, nothing else.",10
East Asia,"Very unique story line with a roller coaster of emotion that you can't predict what will happen on the next episode. Also not just the 2 main leads did shine here, all the supporting characters did also shine both antagonist and protagonist. Showing their own stories. My forever TOP 1 favorite :)",10
East Asia,"Where do I even begin? This series was perfect from start to finish. I was hooked during the first scene. I watched it all in just a few days and I have never cried more in life. Every single character was compelling with their own unique personalities and characteristics.I'm a huge fan of kdramas, but I'm convinced any casual lover of TV would LOVE this show. It's not too cheesy like some Kdramas and it was VERY well produced with a beautiful score and cinematography.I have to give them props for the realism of the portrayal of North Korea. The North Korean characters felt like normal, everyday people and weren't vilified or ostracized just based on their nationality.I don't want to spoil too much of it, but I will say that at first I was bit upset about the ending but it was so well executed that it's grown on me and I'm satisfied with it.I DO want to talk about the elephant in the room-the main leads' acting. Oh my lord, they are PHENOMENAL actors. Hyun Bin and Son Ye-jin are some of the best actors I've ever seen-topping most western actors easily. Son Ye-jin's crying is so convincing and doesn't across as faked or forced. And you can really feel how much Jeong-hyeok loves Se-ri thanks to Hyun Bin's portrayal. Now that I've finished the series I'm gonna make sure to watch EVERYTHING else these actors are in.I give this series an 11 out of 10 stars. It's now in my top 5 favorite TV shows of all time.Don't let the run time of the episodes or the different language throw you off from watching this. It's worth it!!!!Meanwhile, I may end up watching this again...",10
East Asia,Oooooh My God. That was amazing series that i've ever seen.,10
East Asia,"The romance is very cute in this show. However, I think one of the most important things this show accomplishes is educating us about North Korea.Many NK defectors were interviewed in order to make this show, so this may be one of the more accurate depictions of NK in South Korean film. I think it is excellently done. I enjoyed how they did not depict NK as pure evil, like some past films may have done. It shows the life of NK commoners, who are normal people just like us. It's the higher-ups that are corrupt.I really enjoyed learning more about NK through this film, and I think it is great that this show has reached such a wide audience! This way, everyone can learn a little bit more.Many parts of this film is accurate, but there are some exaggerations (e.g. escaping NK is not even close to being as easy as the film makes it seem).Yet, overall, this is a lovely drama. I definitely recommend this.",10
East Asia,"Until ""Crash Landing on You"", I had never saw a Korean tv series or a KDrama. Well, I probably never saw a tv series that could be classified as a love story or a romantic comedy.""Crash Landing on You"" was an absolute surprise and clear deserves all the recognition possible.
In short, several things stand out:The quality of the plot - very dynamic, with an incredible high pace and really well written. Every episode has so much depth that could really be squeezed in a whole season. The plot also offers a really high range of comedy, drama, action and romantic stories. In most of the cases, the caracters make the most reasonable and logical actions - and this is not always common;The vibe of North Korea - a credible, deep, human and interesting dive in the most unknown culture and society of the world;The quality of the actors - some of them, specially some of the secondary actors really stand out and create an impact with a really low screen time;It was hard for me to explain to others why I was absolutly hooked to a korean drama. Give it a go. More than simply a love story, it is a fantastic insight in the korean culture and a great comedy.",10
East Asia,"Hyun Bin is by far my most favorite Korean actor. After enjoying Memories of the Alhambra I was looking forward to Crash Landing on you. It didn't disappoint. He had great chemistry with the leading lady in both series.I really liked Se-ri's friendship with the soldiers and the women in the village. The story woven into how Ri Jung Hyuk and Se-ri met each other in the past was well done. How caring Ri Jung Hyuk is towards Se-ri is like the perfect man a woman could wish for. Their chemistry and with all the other cast members were great.Only thing is like most Korean dramas there are some scenes repeating, this could maybe shorten te episodes, because sometimes it will get a little draggy.But overall lovely romantic show!",8
East Asia,"This show was my foray into world of Korean dramas. Content, acting, research into lives of North Koreans, everything executed to perfection.The character of Ri jyong hyeok and Yoon seri will live with us for years to come. Romance as a subject has been explored tirelessly over the years however, the main protagonists brought an unusual freshness, novelty on screen. Ri's comrades were not usual fillers, they had important roles and all of them played their bit with utmost diligence.The show rightly captures the basic tenets of human values, emotions, irrespective of the side of border we are born and grow up. What sacred games did to Netflix in India, narcos to Netflix in Spanish speaking Latin America, crash landing on you may open up the world to League of K dramas.Extraordinary is an understatement for this show.",10
East Asia,"I absolutely adored this beautiful, funny, tense of a series.Fanstastic acting - specifically to Captains Ri's four comrades who really stole the show at times! However, I loved them all and was so invested in all their individual storylines.I'd love a second season, but I do appreciate the simplicity of the ending. It stays true to the complexity of their relationship and doesn't just give the viewer a stereotypical happy ending.I loved it through and through. This series will be hard to replace!",10
East Asia,"If this is worth 10 stars than so is Dynasty or Beverly Hills, 90210. And be sure that it's the same type of audience thus show is aimed at.
The only differences are the more Oriental setting and semi-politically controversial premise (S.Korea-N.Korea Divide), but make no mistake it's the same soap/melodramatic style as the titles mentioned above.",5
East Asia,It is so hyped because of the lead actors. The ending can be easily predicted. Some parts are very cringey.,5
East Asia,I never watched storyline like this each and every corner of this movie is just wow,10
East Asia,"Crash Landing on You makes you feel the love to your bones! Love is too vague but at the same time too simple! It makes you feel happy, miserable, shocked! And CLON's team just show us how precious love is! Thank you guys! Thanks a million!",10
East Asia,"The show has an intriguing main topic: North-Korea&South-Korea issues, and a love stuck in between. At least this was what I thought it was...However, the plot is ruined by just too much action scenes, too many unfortunate events, and too little romance&comedy which was supposed to be the genre. The starred couple is even rarely seen together during the episodes!K-dramas are normally 40-45 mins. long, yet this one lasts for 1.5 hours for some reason. It is not hard to observe that they pushed to make it this long by using uncalled scenes, flashbacks and everything. I mean, why?In a nutshell, if you are looking for a lovely jubbly, heart warming drama, this isn't the one.",6
East Asia,Dont understand why a fantastic platform like netflix invested in this dumb series that doesnt even a story line.Moreover its a waste to waste the time to pass or be entertained,1
East Asia,"I started watching the drama because it was constantly being recommended to me. And wow, once i started watching , i couldn't stop. The cast, their chemistry was remarkable. I kept smiling from ear to ear at many scenes . It is a drama i would watch again and again. I just know it.
Highly recommend you watch it!",10
East Asia,"After watching this amazing heart melting drama, I couldn't be the same person before. It is not a fantasy which might be happen in movies or series. The pure love is always real! And CLOY just help us to see such reality and feel it in our every angle of our lives!",10
East Asia,"My first Korean series and it was so well done, it spoiled me from finding another KD as great as this. The action, the characters, the styling the clothes...what can I say? Don't miss this.",10
East Asia,"Since many years, North Korea has been a huge interest of mine. A closed off, brutal yet fascinating country. Seeing this series appear while scrolling through titles on Netflix. I knew for an instant, I'm going to watch this series. Watched the first episode right away, watched another. Kept on going. A few days later, episode 16 ends and I'm speechless. Never could I have imagined being so hooked. Crash landing on you or Sa-rang-eui bul-sa-chak is something way more than most things I've ever seen before. It's absurd, humorous, it's beautiful. Acting, camera work, soundtrack, everything on point. There were a few instances where things perhaps got a little too cliche but all in all, this is a unique story, a genius story. Easily one of the best series I've ever seen. Without a doubt, you won't regret watching it.",9
East Asia,"My daughter usually watches a lot of Korean dramas and after watching Parasite my interest was peaked. I was looking for something new after watching the Office for the 12th time and I WAS AMAZED! This is by far one of the BEST programs I've ever seen! It is hilarious and serious at times, but it is excellent entertainment! I just had to write a review for this because of how good it is. Probably my only review but we'll see what Netflix has in store for us! A film you can watch with the whole family!",10
East Asia,"The story of CLOY is very engaging between the fantasy of two star-crossed lovers from the North Ri Jeong Hyeok and South Yoon Seri. The built-in chemistry played by the two characters lead roles, Hyun Bin and Son Ye Jin on CLOY demonstrated their excellent performance, which perfectly fits in those heart-wrenching moments. The use of flashbacks supported an almost seamless transition and caused us to discover the characters of the two lead roles better. Credits, in addition, should be given to the great supporting casts performance. Each of them included a bit of spice, which strikes the exact balance of romance, comedy, suspense and drama. Definitely, CLOY's Ri Jeong Hyeok and Yoon Seri's got me crashed and hooked on the story. It transports us to a place where love knows no boundaries. It swoons us once again with their love testimonials, which makes one's heart flutter and give butterflies into the stomach. CLOY's cohesive story and strong execution from noted cast performances of Hyu Bin and Son Hye Jin is well- loved. Hopefully, if they can come up with another season or another brilliant and intense CLOY story adaptation yet to tell, about Ri Jeong Hyeok and Yoon Seri's long distance relationship struggles and their exact fate in will be worth waiting to it's followers in the end.",9

East Asia,"I have never watched any Korean web series and this is my first Korean series.
I would like to say it's the best web series I have seen. I want to give unlimited stars not just only 10.
This webseries actually tells you about the true Love
This web series will make you cry in every episode of it, and you will never come out of it even if the Web series is finished.
I would recommend every one to see it and understand what is true love.
Finally I should say it's a sweet love story that every one must watch.",10
East Asia,"I'm just one of the many who found it extremely hard to move on after watching this. This series has amazing everything (acting, story, directing, editing, soundtrack, cinematography, casting and chemistry, production design) technically speaking. It's so beautifully made that all cinematic elements fell harmoniously into place with all scenes arranged logically to achieve the desired effect on viewers. There were no unnecessary scenes and dialogs, hence, no boring moments. All scenes were skillfully executed with perfectly calculated movements and delivery of lines by the actors, especially the leads Son Ye jin and Hyun Bin. After watching this, it's been difficult, painful even, for me to watch other Kdramas as I have found the gold standard for Korean drama series. It's clearly a masterpiece.",10
East Asia,Can't stop watching this drama. Best ever Korean drama have ever watched in my life.??????,10
East Asia,"One of the best developed romances I have ever watched. (There is only three or four) Such well handled story: From the second episode until the end I was, as everytime I like a show so much, anxiously hoping they could keep the high level until the end. And they didn't disappoint.
I even liked the set of ducklings that would follow their Captain to hell and back. They could have been annoying, but I found myself liking them almost as much as the main characters.
And who wouldn't follow Captain Ri anywere? I fell in love with his personality in the second episode, swooned with the final scene of the fourth and cried for him until the final one. The fact that such outstanding personality had the body and face of Hyun Bin didn't hurt.
Although it drags a little in the middle, it's hard for us, high-standards-romantics, find a quality show like this, that is original, mostly logic, has a grater-than-life hero and love story, and is not cheesy. If you are the kind of romantic that has sworn off Hallmark movies, this one is for you.",10
East Asia,"This is by far the most beautiful love story I have ever seen in a TV drama. Series of 16 episodes will take you to a journey where it will be hard to return for a while. Story is so gripping that you will hardly get enough of an hour episode. Chemistry between two finest Korean actors will make you fall in love with the concept of it. It will remind you of that feel even it was in your last life. It will make you laugh then suddenly you will realize there is something in your eyes. It has so many great scenes which will 'FLUTTER' your heart. Supporting actors are equally good. Story will take you to a ride of mix emotions, but you will remember this for a long time. I really fell in love with Ye-jin Son after watching this show.",10
East Asia,"Oh my God......I just don't have words to describe how much I loved this show. I have watched more than 100 Korean dramas but this one is my favorite.
How awesome this drama is can't be described in this single review.it is the best Korean dramas ever.",10
East Asia,For some reason this drama is popular among non-Korean audience.This drama is cringe and typical.If you like Descendants of the Sun then this drama is for you.I was excited because it's Hyun Bin X Son Ye Jin but this drama was a let down for me. No depth.,2
East Asia,"Created an account just to give a 10 stars because that's what they deserved. After watching this, I've been fast forwarding or just stop any movie/drama I watched after, then go back to rewatch CLOY.Like Yoon Seri, I think my standard is too high now.",10
East Asia,"Made an account right after watching this drama to rate it ! I've been watching Kdramas for years and this is the best drama I've ever watched. GREAT characters,story and music. recommend it to you all.",10
East Asia,Storyline abit slow but managed to pick up and keep me hooked.,10
East Asia,"This is the 2nd K Drama I have watched and this has made my expectations really high for them. I am awe struck with the characters, story and music. This has made me a huge fan of Hyun Bin, Son Yejin and Kim Jung Hyun.. I think I am going to watch a lot of shows of Hyun Bin now. One of my fav show after a long time. I am going to watch it again and again. The way they have connected the story it's beautiful. Would really recommend this to everyone to watch it once. The cast is spot on. Loved it. Descendants of the Sun is the 1st KDrama I have watched which is good, but this blows your mind away making you addicted to the show and Hyun Bin :(",9
East Asia,"""Crash Landing On You"", this is one of my all time favourite ????
Must Watch ????",10
East Asia,"If you don't want to get hooked on K-Dramas, don't watch this series. Acting, chemistry and story line were awesome.",10
East Asia,"The whole cast, from the undeniably outstanding chemistry of our couple, director, writer, the whole cast, staff - they have their all. Everything was/is perfect. It opened the hearts of many people all over the world. It raised the bar so high in acting versatility that couldn't help comparing it to others (unfair though) for those who haven't tried Kdrama, this one's for you, it worked for me ;)",10
East Asia,I have watched kdramas for years and this is my favorite one! You can feel the real love between 2 main characters and I have laughed and cried for many times. Warm story.,10
East Asia,"Crash Landing On You is a quite thrilling and amazing to watch from the beginning to the end because it contains love, romance, curiosity, comedy, passion, and vengeance. Hyun Bin is a such a talented actor who did a great job in this character and So Yi Jin is also the perfect match for this. I loved this tv show a lot.",10
East Asia,I really enjoyed the show no it's amazing to see the effort of the production to create this comparison between the life of North Korea and South Korea the love in between is stronger than ever and it is really well done 1,10
East Asia,A wonderful drama that has everything a romantic lovestory needs. It was my 65 year old mother who recommened it for me so I have to thank her! ??,9
East Asia,"If I could give this series more stars I would. The angst and romance in this is above par with the junk Hollywood is putting out. The secondary characters are hilarious and wonderful. The main characters are beautiful, heartfelt, and make you fall in love with them. This series has ruined any show I'll watch from now on. They've raised the bar on the formula for the perfect entertainment series. Take note Hollywood. South Korea knows how to entertain...and fall in love.",10
East Asia,Dont have words to describe..a must watch..Yoon se-ri and captain Ri Jung hyuk were masterclass.. even the other cast were amazing..,9
East Asia,"I watched ""Descendants of the Sun"" and wondered if I'd see another series that could match it. Then, I watched ""Mr. Sunshine,"" and thought, ""there's no way I'll ever see another series like this."" Imagine the joy of being wrong twice! Along comes, ""Crash Landing on You,"" which may end up being my favorite of all of them. It's a toss-up between this and Mr. Sunshine. In short, this is one of the best series I've ever seen, and for me, the Korean Dramas I've watched have not disappointed at all as most are character and plot driven. In fact, overall, I've seen better quality shows out of Korea and Japan in the last several years than I have with American shows.The writing, and especially, the editing is some of the best I've ever seen. The plot is intricately weaved, not using some of the typical cliches and devices as some shows do when trying to get the two main characters together. In this case, we're given the beautiful wise lesson on screen: happiness is in the journey. Not the destination.Seri is a woman who owns her own company and is part of an extremely rich family. Her world, despite the money and success, is cold and empty. She sits alone in a massive penthouse. She has all of the luxuries that one could ask for. However, she has a family, especially her half-siblings, who are about as cut-throat as anyone could imagine. She doesn't realize what is missing in her life until a storm, while para-gliding, blows her across the border into North Korea.Ri Jeong-Hyeok is a North Korean captain who comes across Seri. At first, he and his unit of men aren't sure who Seri is and why she's there. Ri Jeong-Hyeok was a master pianist before joining the military, and intent on solving the mystery of his older brother's death. At first, he seems very straight-forward and unassuming, while underneath is a man full of life, passion, and love.The first set of episodes of Seri trying to adapt to life in a North Korean village are especially hilarious. Imagine a pampered woman suddenly having to go without electricity? How to take a bath...how to cook, etc. As a former Peace Corps volunteer, I know full well what this adaptation feels like!Perhaps for the first time in her life, Seri not only finds a connection with Ri Jeong-Hyeok, but also with the village women and also with the members of Ri Jeong-Hyeok's unit. It's ironic that she had to cross the border to find a group of people who were more like family for her than her real family back home!The best plots are ones that aren't forced or contrived, and this one doesn't use either one. We are taken effortlessly from North Korea into South Korea as Seri and Ri Jeong-Hyeok find themselves at the center of two sinister plots, each one contrived by people on either side (North and South Korea).Of course, the biggest question is: despite the situations they must survive and unravel, can they spend a life together? Is it feasible for two people, from the only divided country in the world, be able to have a relationship? North Korea might as well be the darkside of the moon, as communications between the people of the two countries is non-existent. Finding the answer to this question is the beauty of the journey of this series.The entire cast is simply terrific. They meticulously and effortlessly give us endearing characters who are absolutely hilarious at times and heartfelt at others. All are also able to deftly convey a range of emotions, especially the two leads in Hyun Bin and Ye-Jin Soon whose chemistry is much of what makes this series so incredible.The editing is some of the best I've ever seen in a movie or series as we are given scenes in one episode, only to realize that we were only given a partial look at the whole. Each time, we are given a joyful surprise and many, ""Ah-ha"" moments when we realize what really happened!Apparently North Korean defectors served as consultants on this series to try and make life in North Korea depicted as accurately as possible.Some might feel that the ending isn't the most ideal, but that's why I like it. It's realistic. They end up making the absolute most of the time that they have. These contrived, formulaic ""happy endings"" simply do not reflect life or relationships themselves.I have been watching movies and television series for over 45 years, and frankly, this series absolutely blew me away. It captured my imagination and my heart as I see a veritable ""Romeo and Juliet"" struggling to find ways to connect, love, and protect each other. They are such a short distance away from each other across the border, but as I stated before, the distance might as well be from the earth to the moon. I love stories about relationships, where the two people have to find a way to overcome the obstacles and pitfalls laid out before them. Two people with enough love and determination will always find a way. And that is why the joy of watching this series is in the journey and not the destination! And this journey was simply sweet, magical, and joyful. What more could you ask for in a great series?",10
East Asia,"My wife and I watched this show and to say we were blown away is an understatement. One of the most powerful series we have seen in years, We were hooked from the beginning and not been so moved in a show for years! Hollywood could learn a lot from the people who made this.",10
East Asia,"Why, yes, I did create an IMDb account just to review this series and give it a 10/10. I would give it even higher marks if I could!Crash Landing on You was the second Kdrama I watched. I instantly fell in love. The story, the cast, the acting, everything about it is perfect!The series portrays daily life in N. Korea with a human touch but without overly romanticizing it. The character development is excellent, not only for the main cast, but the supporting characters as well. From the main couple (BinJin 4ever!!!!), to Ri Jeong Hyeok's subordinates and the N. Korean villagers, everyone was a delight to watch. The series has a perfect blend of drama, romance, comedy, and action. It also has the wit to take jabs at typical Kdrama tropes in a fun, playful manner.And can we talk about BinJin? Wow. Hyun Bin and Son Ye-jin are AMAZING and their chemistry is out of this world. They are soooooooooooooooo good! You truly feel for Ri Jeong Hyeok and Yoon Se-ri. You cry when they cry and laugh when they laugh. Every scene they have together just makes you melt. This series made me fall in love with these two, especially Hyun Bin. I don't think there's any woman who didn't fall for Hyun Bin after watching this. I binged all his dramas and movies after and am at least $700 in the hole collecting the Japanese releases of his fan meeting DVDs and other media. I even joined his Japanese fan club! I never imagined learning Japanese would come in handy in this manner. I should've taken Korean too, haha. In short, I AM IN LOVE.If you're like me and can't get enough of these two, definitely check out their other work together, the movie The Negotiation (available for rent on Prime Video, YouTube, Apple TV). I truly came to respect the pair's acting abilities after this. The movie is nothing like CLOY and the characters are of course very, very different. Yet, they pull it off with perfection. And HB as a baddie is hawttttttt!I've recommended Crash Landing on You to several friends and they all loved it. I've watched a number of Kdramas since finishing this and I have to say that nothing has come close. CLOY is my gold standard. The rewatch value is great and the series is a perfect introduction to Kdrama.",10
East Asia,"Best K drama , amazing chemistry and acting from the leads, entertaining from beginning to end, great story line and very well directed. The OST is outstanding just love every song they used in this drama. WOW for the cinematography!!! Son Ye Jin's acting should be recognized again coz she did an amazing job of portraying the character of Yoon Se Ri. Also want to give kudos to the supporting casts, they were all great! I have never done a review on a drama but after watching CLOY just wanted to acknowledge the great work of everyone responsible for creating this masterpiece. This drama has everything in it, it will make you laugh, fall in love, it will also make you cry a lot, it will make you realize the importance of having friends and family and it will make you experience a roller coaster of emotions. Please watch it and enjoy the show!!!",10
East Asia,The best Korean series I've watched????????????????????????,10
East Asia,"First ever K Drama I ever watched. And boy, it's so good.
More importantly, it shows the the life of North Korea which most of us are unaware of. Great chemistry and acting of two lead actors aptly supported by outstanding supporting casts.",10
East Asia,"This is definitely my favorite kdrama ever! the chemistry between the two main actors is amazing, the story is interesting and original, and the acting is great. i was honestly really sad when the season ended, and i'm hoping for a season 2!!",10
East Asia,"I haven't watched many K-dramas earlier and started watching this one on some recommendation.
I must say this series is worth every bit of your time, if you love romantic genre. It has a different and refreshing storyline, stellar performance from the entire cast, beautiful OST and many amazing moments.
The lead characters Ri Jeong Hyeok and Yoon Seri have convincing chemistry and they would make you believe that they are real life couples. The supporting cast especially 4 ducklings have also played their part perfectly.
The only bad thing which I feel is that once the show is over, you will think why it ended. Probably end of a good dream :)
Enjoy guys !!",10
East Asia,"I had such fun watching this series. While the main plot of the budding romance between Captain Ri and Se-Ri did the job; they're both cute, charismatic and had chemistry. The real highlight of this series for me was the marvellous cast of supporting characters. They were so good that I've made notes:1. Solider squad: they are hilarious. The friendship! The banter! The loyalty! Special mentions go to Eun-dong (every time he cried out 'Captain Ri' or 'Se-Ri' in happiness, excitement or concern my otherwise dormant maternal instincts went feral) and Joo-Meok (an absolutely delightful dork).
2. Village girl gang: their relationship both during and after Se-Ri's time in the north was lovely. I love Kim Sun-young's acting; she makes me LOL.
3. Dan: ugh so glamorous, so dignified, eyeliner always on point. I love her.
4. Dan's mother, Myeong-run: What a legend. I really enjoyed her character development.In summary, it's ace; give it a crack.",9
East Asia,"Don't let get thrown away by the first episode. It is just to introduce you to the story. Every episode gets better and better, exiting and intense. I think I might not have enough words to describe this show, so I might just call it an experience, a beautiful one of course.
I have recommend it to my friends and family and let me tell you none of whom have watched it was disappointed. So if you are considering watching it but are not to sure, just give it a try, be leave me, you are just going to love it!",10
East Asia,How can something be so beautifully written and so amazingly acted at the same time? I have read a lot of other k drama reviews which say the best k drama ever and was disappointed after watching that. But THIS. IS. A. MASTERPIECE. I cried a river watching the last episode and I plan on crying a bit more watching it AGAIN and AGAIN..,10
East Asia,"Once in a while, u come across a love story and wish the female lead is u.. But only in real life! I don't think guys in real life are actually this much loving, caring and everything perfect like showed in this drama but I would watch it 1000 times more and console myself cz IT'S WORTH WATCHING MULTIPLE TIMES",10
East Asia,"Must must must watch. If only I had a guy who would care this much.. Love this much.. give me scheduled messages for 1 yr advance! Loved the storytelling, acting and literally everything about it. I m grateful to the entire team. I m longing for more k dramas like this!",10
East Asia,"I decided to watch it because I liked the story of the series. I like the story and the flow, the subject processing style is good. I like acting for now, only one season has been released, I do not know if I will watch another season or not. The last note; The episodes were a little long, the latest episode, in particular, had little to do with it. I forgot to add; I wouldn't have guessed that a south korean drama would be so good, I usually see things that look interesting from south korea. It was also good not to focus on love.",8
East Asia,"Don't get fooled by the title because this is a gem! Haven't enjoyed anything as much for such a long time. You get through all the emotions here. Laugh, cry, feel angry, smile as well as get attached to a lot of characters. The chemistry between the two main one is undeniable and kudos to the rest of the cast! The only negative thing is wondering, once you finish it, if something else will ever be this good... No doubt, this is a must!!",10
East Asia,"The story is funny and emotional and sometimes also exciting. I really liked the first few episodes (good humor) and the development of the relationship between the main characters (in the beginning at least). I felt however that the chemistry between the main characters could have been better resp. Was not delivered. I also got bored by them halfway through the drama and was actually rather looking forward to seeing the secondary couple and their evolving relationship. Without the secondary characters (and here I mean the soldats, the women from the village and the other couple), I might not have finished the drama... although the scenery in Switzerland was so nice :) Gotta visit my own country next before going abroad #covid19",7
East Asia,"I'm a bit of a North Korea watcher, and have watched and enjoyed several South Korean productions depicting life in the North, including JSA, the Crossing, Steel Rain and The Crossing. I tuned into this program knowing that it had glowing reviews, with considerable praise for its recreation of village life close to the DMZ. It is quite long, but does have quite a large cast of characters, and several plot-lines. Weirdly, it felt like a mash-up of A Mid Summer Nights Dream, JSA, and Crocodile Dundee!The main plot focuses on a Paris Hilton-type character, who endures a parasailing mishap, and ends up landing on the wrong side of the DMZ, where she is discovered by a North Korean soldier. She fleas the scene, but gets lost trying to find her way back across what would have to be the most dangerous border in the world. Turning up in a small village that seems completely alien to her, our damsel in distress is rescued by the hero of the piece, who decides to hide her and somehow find a way to return her to the south. Of course obstacles abound, and our spoilt heiress has to adapt to life in a small village, effectively hiding in pain sight. Before too long, dodgy elements of the local officialdom become highly suspicious of her, which threatens to create catastrophe for our hero and his influential father. Of course the two fall in love, and things gets rather dribbly from there.A subplot unfolds at the same time featuring a conman from the south (who has British citizenship) who fleas to the north to escape someone he ripped off (whom happen to be the brother of the ""Picky Princess."" In a round-about sort of way, he falls for another spoilt girl, who is betrothed to our hero, who clearly doesn't love her. Another subplot focuses on the family of our ridiculously rich girl, who are going all-out to win favour with Daddy, so that he might choose one of them to inherit his empire, replacing their missing sister, for whom they do very little to find when she goes missing.In the second half of the series, our Princess is safely back in the south, and is pining for soldier boy (forgive me for not using names) who similarly, is missing the woman he loves. The villain of the piece, who is caught out, sentenced and somehow escapes, fleas to the south in an attempt to seek his revenge of soldier boy by killing our girl. Fearing the repercussions that would have, soldier boy finds a way to sneak into the south in an attempt to stop the villain. When soldier boy's father finds out his son has gone south, he enlists the help of soldier boy's unit to go and retrieve his son, before the smelly brown stuff hits the fan.There's lots of drama, comedy, and of course romance, with the obligatory display of martial arts fighting (which was a bit silly, and reminded me of fight scene from the Matrix). There were also lots of coincidences, which were getting more far-fetched as the series unfolded. There was one coincidence (I can't say what it was for not wanting to spoil the show) which was a little too much. I didn't have a problem with what happened, it was where exactly it happened. I'll say no more on that.Overall, this was a well made show. I was especially impressed with the recreation of the North Korean village, as other reviewers have similarly commented. The cast did a fine job, (the group of village women were a hoot, as were the men in soldier boy's unit, and the villain was particularly good) and the production qualities were top notch. It was pretty gushy though, and would describe this series as the most Mills & Boon thing I've ever seen. It's on Netflix in Australia. Do check it out.",9
East Asia,"A 10 for sure all acting was great however the leads Bin and Jin""s chemistry on screen was outstanding. A series that has it all, comedy, action and romance with beautiful scenery.
Definitely hoping for 2nd season.",10
East Asia,"Ok, let's dont mention how Yoon Se-ri got to North Korea.. they called it paragliding mishap, i call it a complete sci-fi. But i suppose they needed to get her in there somehow. Other than that, for me CLOY is a masterpiece. Beautiful story of a selfless love and fellow friendship. A lot of chemistry between main leads, sacrifising one to save the other, although they only knew each other for a couple of weeks. I was also overhelmed by the parents' love for their son, it was a very lovely touch to the story. What i specifically liked though is how they portrayed north koreans, as kind and caring people (set aside politics).
What i didnt like was Ri Jung Heuk pouting :) an adult man should never pout (and i would like to think would never as well).
I hope to see more of Lee Shing-young in the future, he was indeed the most handsome one ;)",9
East Asia,"Sometimes you just need a cheesy story, but this series transcents all romantic dramas. The acting, the storyline, the scenery, the perfect mix between humor, romance and drama. If you are in for a good drama, stop reading go watch it.",9
East Asia,"I have already watched 3 Korean series (Itaewon Class, Extracurricular and CLOY), and I can say for sure that this series is the best of all 3. The characters are so lovely and funny. Yang Kyung-Won is a really great actor too. But the main story between Se-ri and Captain Ri is very, very beautiful. I have enjoyed so much the 16 episodes.",9
East Asia,"I was pleasantly surprised by this show.
Very well made and the characters were magnificent. It made me laugh and cry sincerely. Also, that moment where they get separated at the borders is one of the best scenes I've watched in a series. So well presented and acted. It still gives me goosebumps. I really liked the ending as well. Recommended 10/10",10
East Asia,"This story of a rich young South Korean woman that finds herself in North Korea by complete accident is an interesting one. Observing contrasts between the 2 cultures in a number of different ways is often a source of bewilderment and even humor. The central story, though, is a love story between the 2 main characters, the before-mentioned South Korean woman and a North Korean man. They, together, navigate through a number of troubles and crises of life-and-death nature. Quite exciting. As has been mentioned many times, they have a lovely chemistry. I can say that I find the main actress, Son Ye-Jin, absolutely adorable and beautiful. This entire series is stolen by her charisma in my humble opinion. Truly enjoyed watching this series.",8
East Asia,"I opened this ID just to rate this drama 10/10. It has become my most favourite kdrama.
I think this drama hasn't achieved the amount of attention it deservers.
This drama will make you laugh, will show you sweet sincere romance and will make you cry.
Hyun-bin and Son ye-jin both played their role perfectly and has become my favourite couple.
Apart from Goblin it's the 2nd kdrama that made me cry my eyes out ??
If you're new to kdrama, be sure to keep ""Crash landing on you"" on your watch list.",10
East Asia,"Let's be honest, the lead actress played by Ye-jin Son really carried the team on this one, her acting was very good but the lead actor played by Hyun Bin could barely give us more than two different facial expressions. I found it so frustrating looking at his same blank dumbfounded look the entire time when there could've been more emotions. The love scenes between these two were not intense enough on screen (it could be because if the blank looks?). The supporting actors played by Kim Jung-hyun (the con man) and Yang Kyung-won (loud soilder) were very well portrayed, captivating, and amusing to watch.
Overall, a good storyline, enough suspense and twists to be engaging, and some heart felt scenes relating to friendship and family love.
I much preferred the love story, romance and love scenes from the series Descendants of the Sun.",7
East Asia,"This is a wonderful TV story with talented actors, an absolutely brilliant screenplay and one with a biting comedic take on North and South Korea and the frailties of human beings. I am watching it for the second time having just finished it the first time round. It is also poignant and sad at the same time as being hilariously funny. The writer of the series is someone to watch. I'm looking out for his/her other masterpieces.",10
East Asia,Story not natural. Forcing the emotion too much. It's okay. Not bad series.,5
East Asia,"Called ""Crash Landing on you"" on Netflix UKThis is described on IMDb as a romantic comedy. There's also a lot of action for folk who like a bit of action, including various chases and gun, knife and stick fights as well as hand to hand fighting.I was engaged by the first episode and addicted after the second episode.One of the things that I really like about this series is that it has a large cast, but each of the characters is clearly differentiated and interesting. Even characters with very minor parts, such as a chicken delivery man, have something distinct about them. This is really hard to do when you're working with so many actors and the writers and director should be congratulated on this, as should the actors for bringing the roles to life.This show is often very cheesy and playing on the heartstrings. But who cares, it's great fun. I really enjoyed the scenes with the North Korean soldiers and the North Korean village life. There was a great deal of charm and humour to be found in these scenes.It was interesting to see the perceptions that the North and South Korean characters were depicted as having about each other's countries and people. I don't know whether this is factually accurate or not but it made for some good dialogue.The only thing I didn't like was that at the end of some episodes there were previews of the next episode. For a moment you're not quite sure if this is part of the existing episode and so you end up seeing spoilers. This may just be a Netflix thing. You really have to have your wits about you when using Netflix. Another thing they do is to put their plot summaries on screen when you pause. Often these are huge spoilers rather than a description that just gives you a teaser.",10
East Asia,I just finished this - my third ever KDrama and wow it is probably up there are one of my favorite TV shows of all time. It's SO BEAUTIFUL and lovely and masterful and precious and a show that will always remain beloved in my heart,10
East Asia,"This is so funny and nice drama.i hope thoses actress are do them jobs very well.super lovely movie.but some sence are not allowed to real life......i made an ImBd account just to write a reviwe for this show.this show story line is brilliant.well done,,,,,,,,i rated 100000000000/10000000000000",10
East Asia,"I haven't watched a KDrama before and was recommended this series by my fellow #AnnewithanE fans! They were not kidding when they said that this was a wonderful series. It's beautiful. The plot, script, support cast, the locations, music, every detail. Perfect. But the main reason it's magical is because of the absolutely magical chemistry on screen between Captain Ri and Se-Ri... Magic on screen!! I have to say the absolutely beautiful score is a gem. My tip is to watch it in the original Korean with subtitles if you are English speaking. Don't miss out on the beautiful performances of all the cast .... dubbing doesn't do it any justice!!!! Enjoy being enthralled by this beautiful story!",10
East Asia,"If you want to watch a good romcom, then this one is the best romantic show in k dramas list where actors have done a very good job as well as the script is very well written.",10
East Asia,"I have been watching Korean cinema for the last 12 years or so and Crash Landing is the best! I have watched it more than twice, sometimes rewinding and watching certain scenes over and over again... yet I want to watch it again. The two lead characters are exceptionally brilliant and so are all the others (in particular, the villian 'Gang').",10
East Asia,"Tell me a genre that is absent here except horror, scifi and fantasy. Yeah, it is that kind of a drama. After laughing some times, you will feel thrilled and suddenly you will found yourself being sad and sometimes so romantic. That is how this drama progresses.Hyun bin and son ye jin were top notch as always. They are in top form even at this age.Storyline is superb. Songs are awesome. A rare perfect mixture of everything.Should watch it with high expectation and you won't be dissapointed for sure.",10
East Asia,"Everything Is Just Perfect , It Will Sure Melt Your Heart.",10
East Asia,"I've never scored a 10, but I decided WHY NOT? This series has everything I want in a TV series. It has a sound plot, believable motives, great chemistry between main actors, interesting character development, a bit of action, enjoyable setting and every episode ends on a cliffhanger. Episode 1 was not convincing (I thought oh no, a cheesy Asian drama) but after episode 3 I was hooked. Watched it with my sceptic husband and he loved it too. Will watch this series again.",10
East Asia,Loved each and every character and fell in love with the couple in story. This is must watch in 2020 as this story never ends in negative and uplift mood and help us look forward to hope and faith in adverse conditions. More power to your whole team and hope to see new soon from your team,10
East Asia,"Outstanding applause for all the elements in this drama series. The acting from each cast complements each other. The lead actor, Hyun Bin - is able to bring Captain Ri with such a charming persona because supports from a remarkable acting by Son Ye-jin as Yoon Se-ri, supporting actors/actresses from
Seo Ji-hye, Kim Jung-hyun, women in NK village, NK troops, until antagonist role by Oh Man-seok. They are all contribute a huge effort to bring this series into such an enjoyable & delicate show. My sincere congratulations to Ms Son Ye-jin who let us enjoy her various acting skills in both sadness & happiness :-).Furthermore is the sinematography, how each scene is beautifully framed, each detailed background is carefully crafted. Your eyes is spoiled from opening scenes in Switzerland, NK scenes into SK scenes and everywhere in between.One particular excellent work goes to music score. They are nicely put, beautiful pitch. Song for brother - the piano instrumental touch my heart deeply and I would often listen to it to seek for calmness energy.CLOY production team deserve an appreciation for their hard work. It's not easy to maintain such an emotion during prolong shooting process.I'm looking forward to see more awards for CLOY cast & crew. Koreans should be proud to have such a world-class drama series production. KUDOS!",9
East Asia,Loved the cast loved the settings loved the chemistry and the great sense of humour throughout the show. Great soundtrack and score as well.,10
East Asia,"I was obsessed with this show when I first watched it. It was my second k-drama and I couldn't believe how perfect this show was. I RAVED to everyone to watch it, but no one I know watches kdramas. Finally my mom, the least likely person to ever watch a subtitled tv show, tried it and also became hooked. She has told everybody she knows and gotten like 5 more couples she knows to watch it. If SHE likes it and can overcome subtitles, anyone can. She just finished it a second time and says it's the most perfect tv show ever made! I can't help but agree. Loved the acting, storyline, cinematography, everything. This is a real delight in the glum of 2020. Most kdramas haven't lived up to the bar this show set, but I'm realizing kdramas are way better than American tv, so get on board people! :)",10
East Asia,"As far as a series goes, this came close to picture perfect. The writing is just so nuanced. I know some may find it overly romantic, almost soap operatic, but that misses the point. It's beyond clever. The acting is amazing. In a world where our differences do nothing but divide us, we need Se-ri and Ri Jeong Hyeok. This is the best thing I've watched since the quarantine started. And I've watched a TON of stuff. Highly recommended. And kids can totally watch this too.",10
East Asia,"After watching several cookie-cutter Korean rom-com series I was getting tired of the genre. There's only so much same-old-cliche, cutesy, repetitious, hearing the same song over and over that one can take before moving to something a bit different.Then this was recommended to me and I gave it a look. This series brings the very best of Korean rom-com-drama. They did very well all through this series. While yes, it does stretch on a bit (the final episode is 2 hours long, the equivalent of a movie of itself)... the unique settings, diverse plot, non-standard personalities of the characters, and subplots make this well worth watching.It's not that it doesn't have some elements that were a bit over-the-top and excessively sappy... but those can be excused due to the unusually complex and interesting plot line and excellent work by the actors. There are parts where the dialog and acting is supposed to be excessive, and they do very well in those parts. Both lead actors show a wide range of talent in their parts, as do the supporting actors.There was a singular gratuitous use of MF in the English translation. I have to wonder if that was in the original language or just something the translators thew in there to be idiots. Either way it was lame and spoiled the moment.Other than that this series was excellent, and put K-coms back on my list of ""good stuff to watch"".",9
East Asia,"I am not a die-hard fan of romance, but I have watched enough romance to know the cliches and common plots. Once in several years, comes a movie or a series that gets you hooked onto your seat cherishing every single melodramatic moment, immersing you in the taut plot where you simply don't want it to end. ""Crashlanding On You"" is one such perfect drama. It ticks all the right boxes from crackling chemistry of the protagonists, gorgeous cinematography, catchy background score and lilting tunes to memorable side characters, brilliant editing and the ideal mix of fiction and real issues. A cross-border love of a North Korean army man and a South Korean chaebol enterpreneur is all you need to bingewatch this weekend and feel all the emotions within you. It will definitely remain one of my most favourite romantic stories of all time. :)",9
East Asia,"I am a bit disappointed watching this series since I have high hope towards this series cos I love Hyun Bin very much and Park Ji Eun is one of the best writer so far.The storyline is too simple for 16 episode drama, it could have been fit to 4 episode, even can fit into a 2.5 hours movie. I find the story is so boring that I couldnt finish it and I gave up on 11th episode.Compared to previous Park Ji Eun project (ie. My Love from The Star), the story was too plain. The acting is good, the cast is good, the biggest weakness here is the plot.I dont understand about the hype of its drama, but nothing I can relate towards this drama message to its viewer. Its just typical romance story.",5
East Asia,"This was my first Korean drama, and I was very surprised to see how well they make movies. It's the most amazing show I've seen on TV (I've seen mostly Filipino and Mexican telenovelas). Story is unique and interesting...for the first time I saw North Koreans being portrayed as normal people with feelings, emotions, humor and capable of love. Every character was interesting and well developed; I loved each one of them. Acting is superb, especially by the four main characters. I laughed and cried with them, because I really felt the emotions that they showed on screen. It's a wonderful experience watching this show (so wonderful that I decided to watch it 4x). I recommended to everyone who reads this to WATCH THIS SHOW, and you will not regret it!",10
East Asia,"Everybody should spend sometime and watch couple of episodes to get addicted and start watching till the end. True love story with family concepts and lot of ""indigestible truths"", I mean simple things of our life which really matters and that we are used to leave behind.",10
East Asia,"Clean content . Shot at nice locations.
Love and suspense in all episodes",9
East Asia,There are uninteresting characters and scenes I only enjoyed watching the captain comrades and the lead role.,8
East Asia,"It is the first kdrama I watched and it changed my attitude towards kdramas.After that I watched a lot k-series. It is the best romantic series I watched . It makes you laughf, cry , heartbroken. The main reason for the success of the series is the chemistry between both of them. The supporting characters where also done a great jobe. Each episode is 80min+ long but I didn't get bored for a single episode. It has beautiful background score and shooting location were beautiful. It's an masters piese and I am going to watch it again. I strongly recommend to give a try and I am sure I will fall in love with the series.PLOT
Crash landing on you had a simple story but the exicution of the story makes it great. Crash landing on you tells the story of two people Yoon Se-ri, a South Korean fashion entrepreneur and Ri Jeong Heyeok is a north korean special forces caption One day while she paragliding a tornado knocks her out to north Korean. When she wakes up she is in north Korean border where she met Jeon Heyok . He helps her secretly back to her country. They fall in Love between than time. I can't say any more you should watch the rest.",10
East Asia,"Makes you feel good and makes you emotional at numerous times.
The friendship and loyalty apart from the lovestory are worth a watch.",9
East Asia,"I've watched this show twice (not something I often do). I've never encountered a series where I switched between crying and laughing so effortlessly. I'm also glad that I watched it again, because the first time around I only realised after episode 5 that there is an explanatory epilogue after the supposed ""ending"". There is usually a conclusion with a set of freeze frames, so it's easy to mistake that as the actual end and wonder why Netflix doesn't realise it as well. Although these epilogues are sometimes a continuation of a previous scene with more revealing information, they often supply important backstory information. So make sure you watch until the start of the credits.CLOY is about successful South Korean businesswoman Yoon Se-ri, played by Son Ye-jin, who accidentally ends up in North Korea after going paragliding during a freak storm. She meets Captain Ri Jeong-hyeok, played by Hyun Bin, and after several mishaps they're stuck with each other while trying to get her home safely. If the two main characters were not from powerful and privileged families, the story would probably have ended in episode one with a gunshot, but this is about survival against all odds. Both Se-ri and Jeong-Hyeok have had to deal with trauma in their past, and this adds a deeper dimension to their characters and relationship. The story is strongly supported by the other main and secondary characters, who are easy to sympathise or identify with.The series doesn't have an idealistic or simplistic solution for the tragic division between North and South Korea, but it does make you think a lot about geopolitics, divisions and hypocrisy. CLOY will one way or another stay in your thoughts, even if you just watch a few episodes, or missed the epilogues!",10
East Asia,"Till the 11th episode, i loved it. new story, funny moments, cute, somehow thrilling lovestory, i liked them so much. but after that, it was all cliché and slogan. so 7 out of 10 seems fair.",7
East Asia,Can't get over this drama..the more I watch the more lovely it becomes..almost watching some part or the other..the cast is absolutely favvv and in love with the leads..(hyun bin and yi jin son)... The best korean drama ever...CLOY..,10
East Asia,"Perhaps the story has been told before, but I was riveted by every moment of this drama / thriller / comedy / romance. It was a perfect blend of those elements, alternating deftly between them to serve the story and characters; after a dramatic scene comes some comedy relief to relieve tension, and then a tear-inducing romantic revelation. Every emotion is earned and emerges organically from the characters and the story they are immersed in. It is rare that I've been so affected by a drama like this, and that's good; I don't think my heart can take it.",10
East Asia,"Its the typical rom-com full of clichés but the setting of the story is good and heartwarming. The love story between the main leads are very classic. Although I have to admit the plot is kind of dragging, I stayed because of the four cute and funny soldiers ??Overall, it is a good drama to watch to fill in your free time. If you love typical rom-com dramas with clichés then this drama is for you.",7
East Asia,"Every episode is a master piece. I thoroughly enjoyed every frame. Comedy, romance, action and thriller combo.Feel good series.",10
East Asia,This show is so good. It is the best. The chemistry between the two main characters and everyone in general is perfect. Mr. Ri is mysterious and quiet but actually makes you want to cry. I watched this show in three days and will probably watch it again. You yet can't stop watching! It is a little dramatic at some parts but it just adds to the tension. Please watch this show you will be hooked and won't regret it.,10
East Asia,"I can not express how much I love this show!!! The way Mr. Ri acts make ""my heart flutter""! I am obsessed!! I would 100000000% recommend!! This is what a romance needs to be like. It makes you yearn for more!! It's actually funny and sweet, but also serious and perfectly executed! I love all the characters and the way it is translated to English is gives me quite a laugh! I actually can't stop thinking about it! If you love fantasizing about crazy circumstances and love this is a dream come true! Gah my heart!!!!!!!
If I could I would give this a 47/10!!!!",10
East Asia,"This is a beautiful love story of no matter where you are, destiny speaks volume.
This is the first KDrama that I've finished. Thankful for this series, made me introduced to another KDramas and no they are my happy pill.Highly recommend this series. Hyun Bin and Son Ye Jin are perfect for this show. You'll fall in love with them. The comrades as I call them are the best, the loyalty and friendship speaks volume. You'll see the contrast between South Korea and North Korea. There are aspects in North Korea that are heartwarming and vice versa.I love the location in Switzerland, oh what a beautiful site.",10
East Asia,"I was surprised to see this drama's high ratings.
I'm writing this message hoping that other non-Koreans will be alert.
It can be fun to watch the content itself. But I hope non-Koreans watch this drama and do not think that the reality of North Korea will be the same as this drama.
I first heard the plot of this drama and tried to watch it, but I was curious because it was popular with people at the time of the show.
If you think the genre of this drama is fantasy, everything will be interesting.
However, I am worried that non-Koreans who watched this drama will think that all the contents of this drama are true.
The background of North Korea is not true at all.
Do you really think North Koreans will live like that?
North Korea has no religious freedom because it considers The Kims as God.
Pyongyang is home to the top 1% of North Korea's powerful people, and other areas are like dead land.
The drama is so beautiful that The Kims should thank Hyun-bin and the drama producers.
More than you think, North Koreans are brainwashed by The Kims.
Drama is drama.
For your information, the odds of you falling into North Korea while paragliding are lower than the odds of you winning the lottery.
If the genre of this drama is fantasy, I don't blame you even if you give this drama 10 rating.
Don't forget all the actors and actresses including Hyun-bin are South Korean. DO NOT HAVE A FANTASY ABOUT NORTH KOREA.",1
East Asia,"I was slightly sceptical starting watching this show, however the plot and scrip are amazing as well as their acting. I have never watched a spontaneous, natural and well-done romance between the lead roles. All in all, it is a must watch.",10
East Asia,"This show would be so good if the main characters weren't so blatantly stupid. Minor tweaks to the storyline would have made it a great show. For example, if you expect a military caption to try staunch the wound of someone who has just been shot, rather than cry over their body looking around for help like a helpless child. If multiple people are trying to kill you, you don't return to your house and chill out for an evening. These plot holes are so so easy to fix. But in the end it was just insufferable. I don't think I'll watch another Korean drama now, this has put me off them completely.",2
East Asia,"...get over this now? Words can not describe how beautiful this was. Everything: the comedy, the action, the story behind, the chemistry between the characters (not only the two main)... For me it was the most beautiful thing I ever saw in my life.",10
East Asia,"I have never expected this drama to be STRAIGHT UP PERFECTION!!!!!
The story line was sooooooo amazingggggg !!! Omg I swear it's definitely a must watch !!!!
Beautiful story.. amazing cast... the setting was so so so perfect.. straight up 10/10
No jokes ! Absolutely worth watching ! Each and every single episode is perfection !!!",10
East Asia,I just didn't like the ending but the whole drama was super good. They showed mature but innocent love story. Hats off to the story writer. It's really a good drama.,10
East Asia,"This romance story is set in that place. That place we wish we can save people from. It was really hard to see what we know and choose to ignore. What hurt so much about this series is that I knew it was near to impossible for the main characters, who were from North and South Korea, to be together. It feels so stupid in this time age that people can't be together because of nationality but this alone will be enough to break every part of you but more will come that will weigh even more on you. Those invisible shackles that people from North Korea must live through, in this series, you'll see it all. Thank you so much for this series and I hope to god that Korean will unite so the suffering at least lessen of those living in the north.",9
East Asia,Why don't the Koreans kiss more in their movies etc,3
East Asia,"This drama is everything you want and more. No better way to put it. First of all the cast is about as good as it gets. Son ye-Jin is gorgeous, hyun bin looks fine, but to have someone as stunning as Seo hi-hye as a supporting cast and the villain as oh man seok who just killed his role is just too good to be true.First of all the ye-Jin has a lively and humorous personality and she keeps us engaged every times she in the scene. Hyun bin is more cold and calculated as a officer should be but his buddies that work in his battalion provide that level of comedic relief and depth that takes this drama to another level . Just love the whole group. The drama starts off in North Korea and then just as you think it's going to slow down when Ye-Jin returns to her lavish life back in South Korea it picks right back up and continues in South Korea as well.Just the perfect kdrama that all types of people can watch and enjoy.",10
East Asia,"I am a big cinephile, but never written any reviews on social forum . After watching CLOY I felt like I should start with this masterpiece!
This series is perfect in every possible way, starting from story, writing, production design, music, editing, direction, casting etc etc ..I can just go on and on.
Lead actors are so talented and the chemistry is just fantastic. Ye son Jin is absolutely gorgeous and her cute expressions will stay with you for a long time.
The entire supporting cast are also amazing.
This romantic drama is one of the best I have ever seen and it's 16 episodes of absolute delight .
This is my first Kdrama, didn't have much expectations but I was hooked like crazy and ended up watching 4 other Kdrama in really short time. Koreans are really experts in making Romantic dramas. I know it now.
CLOY will stay with you for a very very long time and bring a smile on your face whenever you think about it. Just go ahead and watch it....I'm sure you will end up watching it again :)",10
East Asia,"Is good, maybe is long, it's perfect with 10 episodies",9
East Asia,Best Show ever IMO!!! Loved the chemestry between the lead actors. Great story.,10
East Asia,"This drama was well done from the acting to the cinematography to the writing. I personally think the Seri's acting was outstanding! One issue I had was that some of the epilogue scenes got too cheesy for me. In addition some of the side plots were a little bit too long, however it is understandable since they were trying to show the differences between the North and South. THE CHEMISTRY also between the two couples were electric! This drama was definitely worth the hype.",8
East Asia,"Exceptional is an understatement. This drama the reason why I have become a Kdrama fan. With the hundreds of Kdramas I've seen since, no one can match this drama yet for me. From main cast to supporting and extras, eveyone just did great. The visual of the drama is very beautiful too. Romance, drama, comedy, action and suspense all in one, superb! And did I mention how beautiful Son Ye Jin and her exceptional and verstatile acting in the drama as always? Love her!",10
East Asia,"One of the best shows I've seen in a long time, it was perfect! The actors and the main characters are just so funny and so good, it feels so real, every episode and every emotion. You are going to laugh and cry together with them, I just love it! It has action, drama, romance and comedy. Such a heart welming and such a kind show.",10
East Asia,"This series was not really what I had expected. It turned out to be basically a soap opera, albeit partly in an unusual setting. Sixteen 80-90 minute long episodes was way, way too much to tell this story. The subplots, especially the one with Jeong-hyeok's brother, were not very interesting. Combined with too much Korean over-the-top style acting in some parts, it gets a bit dull after a while.The show can be divided into two parts: The first half in North Korea, and the second in South Korea. The show is essentially over once Se Ri is back in South Korea, but at that point we still have 7 episodes, or roughly 10 hours, to go.The first half is without a doubt the best, a solid 9. The second half could easily be summarized in one 90 minute episode, because it's painfully drawn out with plenty of slow motion romantic shots and cheesy Korean ballads blaring repeatedly, with a score of 4-5. In the end, a combined score of 7 is quite generous considering the second half which is quite a slog to get through.The pair in the lead are good. The character which turned out to be the most interesting, Seo Dan, isn't given a whole lot to do.It was interesting to see a portrayal (realistic or not) of daily life in North Korea, in the city as well as the countryside. One thing I liked in particular is that the North Koreans were portrayed as humans, and not mindless automatons.I travelled around in North Korea a few years ago, and some of the exteriors of Pyongyang were spot on (like the view from Kim Il Sung square of the Taedong river with the Juche tower in the background), others were not, especially Pyongyang at night. The fictional international hotel in the show is clearly meant to represent Koryo Hotel (where I stayed), judging from the exterior (although it's missing a skybridge). The interior however looks nothing like the real thing.6-8 episodes which focused on the actual story would have been perfect.",7
East Asia,"Wow lots of love for this series. I suppose once Netflix started to carry KDs it is not surprising this series got great votes. The production is good, chemistry between the 2 main characters are there in spades, but for me Goblin, Weight lifting fairy series of KD are more memorable. Catch those too if you can.",7
East Asia,"This show is my first korean tv series. There are a lot of haters on here talking about North Korea. I for one didn't click on this show looking for cold hard facts on North Korea, historical accuracy of the political tensions, or the feasibility of accidentally falling over there. What I did come for is the entertainment, and this shows got it. It's funny, it's sad, and it's got great production!",10
East Asia,"Awesome storyline, character bonding. A perfect love story!",10
East Asia,"I've been watching Kdrama's for a couple years now and they've really opened my eyes to a different world. I've seen a lot of them now and this was easily my favorite series. It is so beautifully written and acted. These are true professionals. The scenery was breathtaking. This story has so much love, lots of comedy at just the right times. I adored watching the wives in the North. They were such a funny group of friends. The military group of men were equally as funny. Each personality of the men really came through and all put together it was awesome to watch. I really enjoyed watching the different customs between the North and the South, even if some of it wasn't true to life. It really fascinates me to watch since our customs are so different. Even the action scenes and bad guys seemed so real and lots of fun to watch. The love story in this touches your soul. I haven't seen a gut wrenching love story where there are so many obstacles keeping them apart since Bridges of Madison County. I never cry watching a series and I absolutely cried many times in this and as the series started to come to an end I didn't want it to stop. I was counting down the episodes. The song he plays on the piano will forever be in my heart and on my phone. ;) I will definitely recommend this to anyone. I'll be watching it again for sure.",10
East Asia,"The story line is very predictable, very boring, almost nothing much really happens through out the entire series.. poor performance from the lead male and female starts.. no chemistry what so ever between the leads.. unnecessarily long episodes.. very boring long conversations.. I think this drama could have ended in 5 or 6 episodes max.. but anyway the rest of supporting actors did a great job that's why I give it six",4
East Asia,"I must admit it took me the first 2 episodes to fully get into this show, but from that point on I was ALL IN! Crash Landing On You is one of the best K-drama's I have ever watched, only second place to Guardian.Everything was on point- the acting, the characters, the storyline, the scenery. I'm truly lost for words. I finished watching the show less than a week ago and I'm having massive withdrawals. There were so many great moments- ones I laughed way too hard at and watched repeatedly, ones I cried for ages to, and many more.Anyone wanting to get into the genre, this is one I'd definitely recommend! Way better than anything you watch on American tv these days.",9
East Asia,"This was the first korean drama I've been able to get into and it blew me away completely. Definitely the best television show made in the past 12 months. If you like romance, action, suspense, drama, and empathetic story telling then this is the show to watch.",10
East Asia,Best series i watched in a really long time. Their chemistry is no joke. It awesome !!!!,10
East Asia,"This drama is so amazing. Everything about this drama is so perfect. Love the chemistry between capt ri and seri, it was so natural. At first, I wasn't interested at all to watch K drama but my friend asked me to watch it and bang, I watched the first episode and can not stop. I just finished it in 3 days.",10
East Asia,"Very interesting to watch as entertainment, but not repeatedly. once was enough.",8
East Asia,"I really really loved this show! I watched it in like 3 days and I've never cried so much at a show. Genuinely very good story, amazing actors, and a great ending. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone. Please please do yourself a favor and watch it, you won't regret it!",10
East Asia,"This series, available on Netflix, is the finest available worldwide!! It has everything: great acting, deceit, machinations, pathos, comedy, intense action scenes and a heart-rending love story. I agree with all the reviews that gave this ten stars. Everyone who has Netfix worldwide is watching it has watched this show. Everyone I talk to has said the same thing: I LOVE THIS SHOW!!!",10
East Asia,"My first attempt to watch Korean drama, I commend the lead actors for a believable acting and great chemistry. . No sex and no nudeness involve but will still shake your core. I felt every feeling, I laughed, I cries, giggled, and I can't get enough of it! I am hoping they will reunite this two if they can't make a season 2. Out of this world, You will want to fall in love all over again.",10
East Asia,This show never failed to put me in a better mood everytime I watched it.,9
East Asia,"If you're looking to see what true, real love and dedication/effort is, then this is the show for you. Will never forget.",10
East Asia,"This was the first ever Korean Drama I ever watched and to be honest after watching this show I was speechless. Absolutely AMAZING. Each scene is memorable and beautiful. I loved the writing and I loved the acting of Hyun Bin and Son Ye-Jin. AMAZING chemistry. I really wish there would be a season 2 :( - Of course our two main characters stole the show however it was much more than this. Each and every character played a remarkable role (The comrades, The family members, The village Ajummas) - All together this was a 10/10 drama. It is a must watch. I am definitely going to give this another watch from the start some day because like a said, each scene is 10/10.",10
East Asia,"No spoiler, I will just say I fell in love with this movie.
Maybe bec also remind me a bit of my past",10
East Asia,"One of the best TV series I have ever seen. And I have seen most of them so I know where to set the bar. A fantastic production. Gorgeous photography and atmospheres. The show is an exciting combination of an ever evolving love story, humor and cold action. It is a story that brings hope and unites people, finding the common good human denominators in ourselves no matter if we come from North- or South Korea. The chemistry between main actors is so engaging and authentic. The story is engaging and fascinating. Everything is perfect and you never want it to end. What more is there to say? In one word: perfection. You just have to watch this brilliant show. Enjoy!",10
East Asia,Just loved the show ..every bit of it ...not even a place where you get bored ... Just watch the first episode ...aft that there's no stopping you ....need to say the chemistry between the two were brilliant ...need a find a word ...it's Soo soooo awesome.....loved it ... Cried and laughed along with the characters ... The emotions in every scene is captured very well and love scenes are ..man ....must watch show I can say .....overall I loved every bit of the show ...really fell in love with the heroine ...Yoon se-ri <3,10
East Asia,"Very typical Korean production: Male & female become love interests; usually from very different backgrounds. Usual emphasis on attractiveness in actors. Usual emphasis on wealth. Usual parent and/or offspring conflicts. Typical confrontational style behavior (is this a Korean behavior norm?) Very predictable ending.Movie starts out with a very cheap CGI of a tornado (especially the whirling farm tractor), and very fake sucking of hang glider into it; surviving completely intact (a little dirt makeup). The worst part was the script's downplaying of North Korea's totalitarian control of it's people. Besides being poorly educated; fed the same propaganda for memorizing; facing imprisonment or death for voicing an opinion (also Russia & China in that cadre); using it's resources to maintain the military while ignoring the feeding & health of it's people. The script, probably for political reasons, whitewashed all of that while portraying most of the North as kind & thoughtful of others.",3
East Asia,"Wow, what a refreshing, clean, romantic and educational drama. I went to YouTube and watched the main actors interviewed over and over.Beautiful love story, as many Korean dramas are, without having to rely on violence, corruption, drugs and so on. So fresh. I will watch it again in a year to develop a feeling of love consciousness.",10
East Asia,"How can two grown and scarred adults fall in love against their better judgment? But they do, and this this is a story of pure and selfless love... But it's so much more: The personal growth of some of the secondary characters is something uncommonly well done. The OST, scenery and production quality are beyond the charts. (And all of that, without goblins) It's a pity that I had to wait half a lifetime to find a romantic show of this quality.",10
East Asia,"Everything is perfect. The actors and actresses, the story and director, everything. The actors who played lead roles, the first and second male and female leads, and other actors who played North Korean roles nailed it. Really felt sad, when Gu jeun dong died . Also big shout-out to the music director for amazing background scores. ?????",9
East Asia,"I normally don't like to watch series. I prefer movies that start and end within 2 hours max. But when I saw my wife and daughter hooked on this series, I decided to give it a try... I got hooked. The plot is amazing, the acting is top notch... not the usual Hollywood bang bang with guns and blood. A beautiful love story with two incompatible individuals. I loved it. I recommend it for everyone... don't miss it. A true masterpiece.",10
East Asia,This is drama that brings me so much emotions..I cried few times. Love it <3,10
East Asia,"What's most incredible is that Hyun Bin and Son Ye-Jin fell in love in real life! ! ! !Haengbokhaseyo??????Perfect and touching acting????????????
Marvelous OST??????
Warm and humble lifestyle????",10
East Asia,"I loved this drama, all actors did a great job in producing a great fun romantic drama. I really enjoyed the storyline, the outcome was good and acceptable, as always, we always wish for more. Yes its worth watching.",9
East Asia,I have never watched a series that made me feel this way. From the plot to the actors everything was just perfect and so touching.,10
East Asia,"I dont even know how to start. AMAZING. The acting is so good. You can feel the chemistry between the two main characters. It was so real that now that chemistry turned into a real relationship. Anyways when watching the first few minutes of it, i thought it was something not for me, but i thought wrong. Its very funny as well. Highly recommend",10
East Asia,"Yes this production really is THAT good! I can't even call it a series because it's more like an amazing group of consecutive films. My mom and I binged this in 3-4 days, missing lots of sleep because we could not stop watching. We HAD to keep going, it wasn't even a choice.
I'll have to admit, this was my first Korean romance series! We needed a break from the tense political news & wanted to watch something we could escape to. After the first episode, I was not sure what to think as it was a bit slow. But after that first episode, things pick up and completely submerse you. It's everything all wrapped up into one: romance, drama, thriller, suspense, comedy. The acting is so amazing!!!! I'm in awe of this wonderful production. I laughed in the beginning & middle, while I cried and gasped in the last half. Watch all the way until the end, you'll love it! It's an intense journey of love, family, cultural difference, friendship and community. I'm praying and PRAYING for a season two!!",10
East Asia,"One of the best drama series I've ever seen! All of the actors were outstanding and all had amazing chemistry! An absolute must watch, so heart wrenching and heart warming..",10
East Asia,"If you're looking here to find encouragement to watch this show... don't look further than all the 10/10 reviews you see. I've had an IMDb account for years and I never wrote any reviews. Well this is it. This show pushed me through so many emotions I can't find words to explain them. It's beautiful, sad, joyous, devastating but ultimately... heartfelt. You will cry tears of sadness and heartbreak but the tears of joy will leave the biggest print. Watch it. The actors don't only bring the characters alive, they live through them and bring the masterpiece the writers created for us to see. You won't regret it.",10
East Asia,"I can only say this series was flawless. Direction, location, music, story. And the actors -- leads and supporting were superb. I will probably add this to films and series that are my go to for feel good entertainment.",10
East Asia,Brilliantly executed and absolutely keeps audience captivated.,10
East Asia,"Back in early 2020 I came across this drama as it kept coming up on Netflix. I was immediately hooked and in fact this started my love for dramas! This is a must watch - there is a mix of romance, comedy, drama...it made me go through all sorts of emotions (be prepared for tears!). There was great chemistry between the leads - Son Ye Jin and Hyun Bin, who are now an actual couple now (announced in Jan 2021) - I love them so much. Perfect cast, perfect story, perfect script! You will want to watch it over and over again!",10
East Asia,"9/10 is my rating. This is a 2019/2020 South Korean television drama with 16, 70-110 minute episodes.Yoon Se-ri (Son Ye-jin) has lived the life of a Princess as a chaebol heiress to one of the largest conglomerates in South Korea. She is the only daughter and has always been somewhat of a black sheep leading her to form her own successful fashion sporting goods line. She has two older brothers who would be the logical successors to her father, however, he does not feel like his sons have what it takes to run the business. He announces his plan to have his daughter, Se-ri, run the company when he retires and plans to announce it at the next shareholder meeting. Se-ri is excited to have proven herself and vows to wrap up her own business and put it under management with just one final campaign. To test a flight suit she goes paragliding in Seoul and a freak weather event, with tornadic winds, blows her off course into North Korea's portion of the demilitarized zone. Having lived a pampered life she does not, at first, realize how dangerous the situation she has found herself in is. As luck would have it, she is discovered on patrol by Ri Jeong-hyeok (Hyun Bin) who is from a powerful North Korean family and is serving as a Captain in the Korean People's Army. Unlike Se-ri he knows all too well what might happen if she was turned in to the North Korean military police. After some reluctance he decides to protect her and help her get back to South Korea. Meanwhile, Se-ri's family, particularly her brothers, assume her dead, and began competing for the role of their father's successor. When they find out Se-ri is alive by chance, they conspire to keep her from returning to South Korea. Meanwhile Jeong-hyeok has been trying to solve the mystery surrounding his brother's death and winds up with an enemy in common with Se-ri who is determined to expose them both. Although Jeong-hyeok is engaged to a North Korean heiress, there is no love in the arrangement, and he finds himself drawn to Se-ri and she to him.
spoilers*. I like the glimpse into North Korean life that this show gives. It illustrates how people all over the world are very much the same in that we want good things for our kids, to have loving friends, and see the people around us happy and healthy. In the beginning, when the female lead first landed in North Korea I liked how they did not immediately befriend her but had a debate about what to do with this person who was possibly an enemy. It felt like they went through the same type of discovery and found that they had fewer differences and more similarities. I liked all the young military men and how loyal they were to each other and to their captain. I thought it was interesting how she found a way to fit in with the local women and came to be friends with them. The male leads fiancé and him were in an arranged marriage and it was interesting to see the conflict as he started to fall in love with someone. It also delved into love versus obsession and there was a lot of character growth on all of their parts. The female lead started as a spoiled and ""Picky Princess"" but she learned through being around people that had so much less than she did yet still found ways to enjoy life and each other that she did not need all those things she had back in South Korea. I thought the way her family had very little love between them as they were too busy fighting for control of the company showed the way when the focuses is on the material a lot of the joyous things in life are lost. I would've scored this even higher but I was, unlike a lot of people, disappointed in the ending as I thought they might find a way to be together either her going to North Korea or him defecting to South Korea. I thought perhaps there was an angle with her being rich and them wanting her money as the father had mentioned. It turned out in the end that they were only able to be together in SwitzerlandJust a couple weeks out of the year. I was also disappointed that the side couple never got to be together because he wound up dying around the time he finally came around and redeemed himself. I still feel like it is Netflix influence that makes it so the females in these act as if they don't need a man in their life. That is a very modern Western concept. I know some people would say there are families that live that way and that is considered a normal type of ending or at least one possible ending. To me I watch stuff not to see the harsher parts of life play out, I like the happily ever after stories as I think life is hard enough as it is. Still it was very good and very well written with excellent actors. The chemistry between the couples was very believable and the friendships were heartwarming. I highly recommend this to anyone that wants a glimpse into North Korean lifestyle as I understand there were many North Koreans who provided information and insight for the script so while it is still a movie and not entirely based on facts a lot of the major elements such as power outages, house searches, and a lack of technology for most people I understand accurately portrays life for many North Koreans.",9
East Asia,"My wife never wanted to watch a show twice, but after we finished watching CLOY we immediately started all over again. We laughed and cried all over again. We felt like we were part of the story all over again. It is just perfect. It will be forever our favorite show of all time.",10
East Asia,"I have been won over to Korean drama by Mr Sunshine and then by this very moving romantic comedy thriller. I would rank these two series as the best thing I have seen on television in years.Crash Landing on You builds up such an emotional head of steam, driven by the predicament in which the leads find themselves and great central performances. Son Ye-Jin and Hyun Bin are both perfect. The final episode is simply sublime.If only western dramas could rediscover the power of story telling and forget the mandatory inclusion of gratuitous sex and bad language.",10
East Asia,"My friends keep talking about this and after seeing such good ratings I decided to try. Honestly I still gave it the time until episode 5. My god this show is boring. Like the episodes are wayyyy too long and dull.
I love romantic stories but if this is what it's about then it's just plain boring.
Do not understand the hype.",3
East Asia,"Let me say, first, that this is a really, wonderful K-Drama, but it's not my favorite. It is up there in my top 5, though.The writing and the cinematography are excellent, but the very best part about this series are all the extremely lovable characters.Worth the watch.My top 10 are, as follows:
1. It's OK to Not Be OK
2. Mr. Sunshine
3. Start-Up (2020)
4. Rookie Historian
5. Crash Landing On You
6. The King:Eternal Monarch
7. Cheese in the Trap
8. A Korean Odyssey
9. DoDoSolSolLaLaSol
10. One Spring Night
Sorry, had to add an eleventh...
11. Strongest Deliveryman
Honorable mentions: ""My Holo Love,"" ""Strangers from Hell,"" ""Vagabond,"" ""The K2,"" ""Something in the Rain,"" and, ""Cinderella and the Four Knights.""Currently watching, ""My Sassy Girl"" and ""The Uncanny Counter,"" which I'm totally enjoying!
If I left out any of YOUR favorites, I probably haven't gotten around to them, yet.",8
East Asia,"Everything about this drama is just wow! The acting, scenery, plot and especially the OST (probably listened to this more than I'd dare to admit). The whole ""paragliding accident"" can seem a little far fetched, but the story really really evolves from that. Cried like a baby during the last episode and will probably need some time to emotionally recover from this show. Don't think I've ever watched something that would get to me this much, being able to portray such a powerful love story without a single sex scene, just wow.",10
East Asia,"This was the second Korean series I had watched from start to finish and since the first one was Sky Castle (which is also very good, by the way), this was my first romantic K-drama. Lots of K-dramas are now available for streaming, so it is easy to watch them.The plot is actually quite complex and the episodes very long, with plenty of time for character and story development. The production seems pretty high budget, with an (almost) high budget film-like quality.The basic premise of the story (Chaebol princess accidentally lands in North Korea when paragliding) is quite silly, so my recommendation is that you should watch at least two episodes before deciding whether you like it. The romance element is quite important, but I think the series might also appeal to people who are otherwise not that much into romantic stories, due to the North Korean angle. Most of the story takes place in North Korea, with lots of North Korean characters and a very interesting, nuanced portrayal of life and people there. I've read that the producers used North Korean defectors as consultants when developing the story. The portrayal of North Korea is said to be somewhat idealized, although there are lots of negative things depicted (informants who spy on ordinary people, frequent power cuts, etc.). Actually, what is very interesting is that North Korea is portrayed as a fairly modern country that has changed a lot, with some elements of market economy (with thriving black markets selling all kinds of South Korean products and the relatively lavish lifestyle of rich people there), while also being more traditional than South Korea in many ways (for example, due to the unreliable electricity supply, people still store kimchi in the traditional way, under the ground). The North Korean characters are quite nuanced and multi-layered, too, with the exception of the villain, who is just plain evil (by the way, he is played by a good-looking, charismatic actor). My favourite character is the North Korean girl's, Dan's mother, who is just hilarious.Talking about humour, it seems that K-dramas tend to have comic relief characters even if the subject is serious. The comedy mostly comes from these characters yelling and hitting each other, which can be irritating, but in this series, there are also examples for more subtle humour, e.g. when the otherwise perfect North Korean captain (the male lead) is shown to be quite vain or childish. There is a very cute scene where the female protagonist restricts his time on the computer because he gets too hooked on online gaming.The male and female leads have very good chemistry (it comes as no surprise that they are a couple now in real life, too). Hyun Bin, the actor who plays the North Korean soldier, is a handsome, masculine and charismatic guy, but his character is such a perfect gentleman and so reserved here that he seems a bit slow on the uptake. The female protagonist seems to be a spoiled, entitled woman at the beginning, then slowly becomes more complex. Son Ye Jin seems to be a good actress and she is pretty, too (although the actress playing the North Korean girl is much more beautiful, in my opinion). I really enjoyed the romance, although it could have been much better. First, it was not shown why the two characters were drawn to each other (except for the story of having met years before, which was a bit over the top). There were no scenes with them flirting, having a good time or having interesting conversations. It was all about them disliking each other first, then all of the sudden falling in love and making sacrifices for each other. For sure, chemistry can be more than enough for a love story, but, at least for a person used to American/European films and series, the complete lack of physical intimacy/passion seemed strange. Considering that the two protagonists are in their thirties and single, there was no allusion even to touching, let alone making out or having sex, even though they spend weeks or even months living together and being head over heels in love. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that there should necessarily be sex scenes, which are probably awkward for actors, anyway, I'm talking about an almost complete lack of intimacy, except for one or two chaste hugs. The very few kisses with pressed lips (like in American movies from the 1950's) are as sexy as this romantic series gets. There is another cute scene where he is showing her his scars at the hospital, but it doesn't go anywhere, either. I'm guessing the main target must be more conservative Asian audiences. However, what is lacking in intimacy and passion is amply 'compensated' by the obtrusive, cheesy love songs that start to play very loudly every time the two protagonists are together (even while talking!). There is also a secondary love story between the North Korean girl and a South Korean guy, also played by cute actors, but I had the same problems with this love affair, too (at least here, the guy was trying to flirt).",8
East Asia,"This is a first class show with two well known actors; Hyun Bi as ""Captain Ri""
and sexy Son-Ye Jin as ""Yoon Se-ri."" And instead of the usual teenagers, these two are both 37, tho', IMO, look younger. However age does have its privilege's as they can surely act and have good chemistry together.Premise is that a wealthy and independent Queen of Fashion and skin-care products (Se-Ri from Seoul, South Korea) tests a paraglyder, gets caught in a Tornado - AND ends up in North Korea! - where she meets Captain Ri, and the games begin.17 x 2-hour episodes is long enough to flesh out the story. Highlights are the differences between life in North Korean villages versus the capitalist and hedonism of South Korea's Seoul. Which leads to some hilarious exchanges.Throw in back-stabbing siblings, power hungry military types, Chinese Mafia, naïve army conscripts, the usual Love Triangles with jealousy abound, nutty parents - and you get a pretty decent show. Have your tissues handy for the last few episodes. Check it out. All in all, IMO, worth 9/10.",9
East Asia,"I might be a little late with this review, but I had to.I started watching the series in march 2020, but after the first three episodes it got boring. At that time it didn't get to me.
At the beginning of this year I overheard some friends talking about this show. It got me excited again, which let me to grab my laptop for the second time. Let me tell you, I was hooked to the series. I definitely stayed up late many times.There are many things to notice from the series. The chemistry, the development of the characters and the interactions between the characters. Name it, this show has it. Yes, this show is about romance, but let us not forget the well-played action scenes. And when you watch the last two episodes, you realise that you finally really know the characters and the motives of their actions.Crash Landing On You, you definitely left some scars. The numerous times I had to wipe away some tears, uncountable... It also made me realise that love does have boundaries. Even if you love someone deeply, you will always face obstacles along the way.",9
East Asia,I enjoyed immensely this Korean Tv series. It was the most delightful surprise!!! A most beautiful love story with a glimpse into the Korean way of life!!! Great performances by the actors as well. I was moved more than once.,9
East Asia,"I do not know how many times it has happened after watching this web series that I was just about to cry but it did not happen, but I loved it very much....
Love you Ms.Yoon SI RI & Mr.Ri",10
East Asia,"Captain Ri and Yoon Se Ri are one of the best pairing in Kdrama land! A beautiful romance yet comedic scenes are well portrayed by Hyun Bin, Son Ye Jin, and all the cast as well. No wonder that they are dating dating nowadays hehe. Ok, back to topic, the plot, the cinematography, and the good soundtrack are unites as one as well this drama ends. I really appreciate the cast, the director, the writer, and the whole crew for making this beautiful drama! Good Job!",10
East Asia,"I love every single moment of this drama.
The story and the cast are soooo amazing.
This drama has everything that a good and perfect drama should have.",10
East Asia,"Selfless, deep and intense love. I watched many korean drama series but this one is so engaging. I wish everyone find this kind of intense love.",10
East Asia,"OMG I don't want that this stops I want this will go forever, I love this show I feel for this show feeling bad after this finished",10
East Asia,"I did not want to finish this series and did everything I could to prolong watching the finale. I was mesmerized by the woven subplots and the honesty portrayed by all of the actors...especially the 2 leads. While heavily emotional, there was enough comedy, suspense and action to drive each episode's content. Everything that I wanted to happen happened and the expectation of karma coming around; or character/relationship developments had me binge watching this series. As I was getting closer and closer to the end, I just wanted to go back to the beginning and start over again. I loved the vulnerability of Ri in Hyun Bin and Se-ri in Son Ye-jin, along with the N Korean military crew. Men should not be portrayed as emotionless statues. It's refreshing to see the emotion, respect and devotion from them.
Such a beautiful and respectful culture/country that I will visit one day. Yes this is fiction, but some of us still dream about finding that kind of devotion, respect and love. I was begging my friends to watch this series just so I had someone to share and discuss it with. Great job to everyone involved with this series. You have made me a dedicated K-drama fan!!",10
East Asia,"Everything about this show... EVERYTHING is sublime. The storyline and all of its subplots, the acting, the direction, the pace, the comedic moments on the heels of heartbreak. Just... everything.
It's the small moments that get you. The women's reactions upon receiving their face cream. The bewilderment and grief of the ducklings when Se-ri is shot (No... NO!). The abject fear of the villagers and the utter self-loathing of The Rat. The steely sang froid of Ri Jeong-hyeok's abuji...
Unable to stop yourself, you become a voyeur of the most profound moments in these people's lives and are left richer for it.",10
East Asia,"I don't write review usually. But this one compelled me to do so. This is one of the best series period.
Watch it to experience awesomeness..
For Indians, they have voice dubbing in Hindi. The dubbing is awesome..",10
East Asia,"The series actually shows that there can be nice people and humane people who are true to their feelings and keep their promises. The sensibilities of this series matched so much. Love is not physical, though not denying the importance, but I like to believe that it is more than that to last.",9

East Asia,"Review By Kamal KCrash Landing On You was about our main female character that ends up in North Korea after getting into an unexpected accident and a North Korean soldier that ends up falling inlove with her. Sounds interesting right? Well the premise of the story is already an attention grabbing . Every episode leaves you wanting for more. All characters are potrayed very well by the actors. You will enjoy every bits of it, This drama makes you care for every characters, no one is left behind. Our main leads have great chemistry like I can't imgine any actors playing the same role, Hyun Bin and Son Ye-jin were really meant to play the roles of Captain Ri Jeong-Heok and Yoon Se-ri. All in all Crash Landing on You managed to give everything I want from a rom-com series. It might be cliche and predictable at some parts but it was done right and this series will also give you a new perspective on how people actually live on the other side of the korean peninsula.",8
East Asia,"This show absolutely changed my life. From the first episode I was laughing and enjoying myself! This is the first Korean Drama I've seen, I had seen a few Korean movies here and there, but no shows. This is a MUST WATCH for everyone no matter what language you speak. The story has romance, action, drama, comedy, suspense, LITERALLY everything. I never write reviews, but this show is an exception. I cannot stress this enough: WATCH IT.",10
East Asia,"I gave 1 because the guy in North Korea died. now I feel so bad for watching. If he was alive I would give 10. In general, movie was awesome.",1
East Asia,"Since the first episode, or even the first 30 minutes, I know this is going to be a big hit! I usually am not into K-drama with melodramatic storylines. But CLOY is something different. Still with that Korean romance that happens, adding politics and well-researched facts, the story happened to be very interesting with logical explaination. A bit too-cheesy set-ups, but we all need uplifting stories to hold onto nowadays don't we? The second part (after Se Ri left North Korea) was a bit cliche, but still hooked. I love how the crew carefullt research about the most mysterious country in the world, and worked on production. Beautiful visuals, logical storyline, very well acting from top Asian stars, this is definitely phenomenal!",10
East Asia,"Korean television dramas are usually well produced, featuring attractive protagonists, decent acting, and occasionally interesting set-ups. But they rarely scale any great heights and they are often laden with irritating tropes and lazy writing and they rarely have much to say. Crash Landing on You is the exception. It is a show that can hold itself up against anything produced around the world.
Two key elements: First, the perfect pairing of Korean megastars Hyun Bin, playing a North Korean army captain undertaking a tour of duty in the DMZ that separates North and South Korea, and Son Hye-jin, playing a chaebol heiress who paraglides into the DMZ because of a freak tornado. Their charisma just explodes off the screen. Second, the nuanced portrait of North Korea, with many realistic aspects, even if some of the worst villainy of the Kim regime (the Kims themselves are never mentioned except in banners praising the leadership) and the extremes of poverty and suppression are toned down. The producers and writers went to a lot of trouble in this regard, including hiring as a co-writer a defector who had attended film school and served in the Kim family protective detail.
Supporting all of this is a very well written story that combines drama and comedy, the drama arising out of the efforts of the captain to help his unexpected visitor to return to the south as well as his dealings with a villainous commander in the State Security Department played with snarling aplomb by Oh Man-seok; the comedy from the North Korean villagers, especially the women, the terrifically funny foursome of North Korean soldiers commanded by Hyun Bin, and the various half-witted members of Son's South Korean family and other hangers-on. The script manages to avoid all the idiotic cliches that overpopulate Kdramas and manages to bring itself to a satisfying conclusion without the saccharine overdose that one might have feared. I can't think of a single time the story dragged.
The great supporting cast is mostly too numerous to name, but a tip of the hat to the second leads, the ravishing Seo Ji-hye who manages to keep the straightest of faces as Hyun Bin's erstwhile fiancée, and especially Kim Jung-hyun, playing a mischievous half-bad guy, half hero from South Korea who flees to the north to escape the consequences of his various fraudulent business schemes.
All in all, a triumphant piece of work, that manages to combine adventure, comedy and romance in a perfect family-friendly blend. The real crash landing is when you've finished watching it.",10
East Asia,"No movie or tv show i've ever seen, has come close to compare to this. And i've kept track of every single one, which is about 540.I laughed, i cried, i got shivers down my spine. Their chemistry is immaculate and the story... wo! Also their acting! I feel everything they feel. I've never cried so much my entire life (ep 7-9). They have a way of always finding the exact right thing to say to completely break your heart.The character arcs. The script. The scenes. The music. No words can explain how much this has changed my standards for both movies, tv-shows and especially men...Well done.",10
East Asia,"Just as several other reviewers has mentioned, you get totally hooked on the characters! I just finished watching the last episode and I already feel like I miss them all. I don't know how I move on with life after this masterpiece. I've laughed out loud and cried my eyes out. The quality of this is insane in so many aspects. You won't regret watching it!",10
East Asia,"I watch a lot of k-dramas and I always skip the parts I'm not interested in, but in this one it didn't happened once! Everything about it was so interesting, specially the characters. From the army boys, to Dan and her family, to Seri's family, to the women from the village. Honestly, there isn't a single dull character in this serie. It's been two months since I finished it and to this day I still catch myself missing the characters. And don't get me started on the main couple, I mean, they were absolutely perfect. Amazing chemistry between two amazing actors, they couldn't have been better. I'm so happy I watched this and I'm so happy it got the recognition it deserved. Only bad thing about Korean dramas is that we never get second seasons, and I wish so bad we could have a second season of this one.",10
East Asia,"This show is one of my fav shows ever! It's a sweet romantic show with some action and comedy. The friendship between the soldiers and the main lead girl is so funny and the chemistry between the two main leads is so good. I've watched this show two times and I never do that as I tend to get bored. When i first finished it, I was really sad and now i'm sad again because I finished it again. This show is a must to watch!!!",10
East Asia,This series is pure genius. Gripping and satisfying from beginning to end. I want to watch it again.,10
East Asia,"Whether you are fan of K-drama or not... seriously you'll gona... become die hard fan.,of K-drama after watching this show.... seriously it is tooo good.....start watching it from today with your family and friends..,.",10
East Asia,"Watched first 8-10 eps with some effort. Simple & elaborated, some are predictable & fake compared to real world life.",6
East Asia,"I thought it would be a good story with deep drama and comedy.I love korean dramas, and liked Netflix series too, so I expected the same values from both.Unfortunately this drama is flat, way too long and the dialogues and so much repeated sentences.Direction style like a Chinese comedy what doesn't mean good.Some parts are ok, but most of the time is not.Music is not matching with the story, sometimes too loud and even annoying.Character error in every person.The story does not add up.All people out of their characters.Why they more than 1 hour long?It could be a good 2-3 hour movie, but it is not:(Childish, characters,childish jokes.Too long, over explained.",4
East Asia,"Normally this story firstly show you the cruel part of North Korea how they are surviving their lives and then after that you fall in love with this series, the love story, of both are heart warming ,in last episode you really going to cry. And yes I also cried a lot in last episode, but end with happily.Give a try to it. This series gives u big lovable emotions.",10
East Asia,"It is the worst k-drama i have ever watched, I saw so many people raves about it and how popular it was, i have high hopes when first staring to watch it and immediately dissapointed.This drama is so cringy and the storyline and scene is just so boring, waste of my time watching it, i have seen better k drama and this one was no where near it.",1
East Asia,"Best best best show! I have got so many of my Indian friends addicted to this show! It's flawless! What chemistry!! Imagine having Hyun bin character in real! His smile and his positivity will ball you over! His acting was always praised but this one did a huge number to us .We love him and his character is our most favorite ever. You have lived us through so many emotions, you have made us cry, we felt pain when u were hurt, we were happy n clapping when you hugged her and we were worried when you crawled out from tunnel. Thankyou director for giving us him.The casting is spot on! From the leads to support, no one could have played these characters better than this crew. First of it's kind that I have gone n googled n Instagram followed a supporting cast! Go n sweep away all the awards of this year. You have set a benchmark and it will take a while to some other Kdrama to match you. The writer knows his characters and these actors have really skinned their characters especially Dan's mom ( who was also in Oscar winning movie parasite), the way she speaks English n says ""oh my gosh"". It's quite tough to say who is my favorite supporting cast. Maybe it's all four soldiers and Dan's mom!Yejin, Se-ri, she has never played such a fun character before who is Rich but street smart. I am just smiling when I see them together.She never played a victim and that's what made this drama more interesting. The way she looks at him and gets all worked up wen he answers he is okay. She knows he is always pained. She wants to help him by stepping back , n we feel that emotion of hers! Best expressions she ever gave on the show was wen she takes him shopping and he steps out in a suit . Omg not only her jaws fall down, mine too along with 1million girls watching the show!!!They have paid so much attention to detail that even his video game name was ""tomato cultivator"" because se ri had gifted him a tomato plant. Such small small details not only makes us smile but wonder how romantic the writer is himself!Definitely kdramas have fate as their backbone story but it's so touching that you become their cheerleaders. I have watched all the episodes at least 4 times in loop! I am glad to learn Korean language and I m so eager to visit South Korea!From secret garden to something in the rain, you both have got the crown of king n queen of melodrama respectively but this show has made u both king and queen of our hearts forever. It's gem and we will treasure this forever. I will still smile and blush and cry and cheer for this every time I see it .Special mention of beautiful OST. Amazing songs and lyrics. Descendants of the sun and Globin had their ost on billboard charts and now Cloy is taking over!I would like to thank the crew of crash landing who have worked round clock to deliver this . I remember reading news of cast falling sick because of tight deadlines. Thank you u deserve all that applause.Main cast to supporting cast, everyone just stands out and has their own charm. It's one of those few shows, in which u will have favorite supporting actor and will always remember their character and their names. Amazing bonding with leads, their humour to their feelings, when they unite, I m sure even the toughest heart will cheer and have a tear! Screenplayng is their backbone . Now it's over, what I am going to do on my weekends??Plz come to India also. U have massive fan following here.",10
East Asia,Great K drama. I watch this with my mom and my cousin'sThis is Amazing!!!!!!,10
East Asia,"This is a must watch if you want to enjoy superb filmmaking, acting, and a fabulous original sound track. The screenwriting is so clever, and unearths a whole world few think of - the lives and people of North Korea. For an international audience, subtitles can be a turn-off, but get over this hurdle and you'll enjoy a beautifully told love story, that is embedded in a world filled with thrills and suspense. Honestly, it's the best show I've seen in years. I rarely rewatch shows/movies, but I've enjoyed this one as much the second time, and wouldn't be surprised if I come back to this one again and again.",10
East Asia,"How good is this Kdrama?Well I have watched dozens of Kdramas and movies and this is the only show that I have bothered to write a review.I loved the chemistry between Hyun Bin and Son Ye-Jin, have always love their interactions since ""The Negotiation"" and this show just brought it to the next level. The wonderful cast of all the supporting roles have also contributed positively to the show. Kudos to the director and the screen writer.This show has touched the deepest side of my emotions, and I have never thought that I could actually feel the joy and pain with the characters when the story develops.The side effect of watching CLOY is, I couldn't pull myself to watch another Kdrama as I believe none will be as good.",10
East Asia,"One of the best k-dramas I've watched so far!?? In the beginning when she crashed into his world they thought it was a coincidence but it actually was the fate!????At the beginning he didn't knew anything about her, what she liked, didn't like, who she was e.t.c. And she didn't know who he was, how he lived, what he liked and didn't like. The more time passed they got to know each other better and better until they started to fall in love w each other!??At first Jung Hyuk was cold as ice, he didn't smile, laugh or showed any type of emotion. He worked in the military which explains a lot but at the same time not. He just did as his parents wanted and he didn't break any rules or laws until Se-ri came into his life. He became sweet, warm-hearted, caring and he laughed, smiled and even fell in love! He learned things from her like he's never done before. He sheered her up when she was sad and got jealous over her showing her appreciation to other men.??
Se-ri in the beginning was strict, a popular business woman who was going to take over her family's company. She didn't do anything except working hard for her company without taking any breaks. She wanted her business to become one of the best in the world. She didn't either laugh very much, was also cold as ice and didn't let any people into her life until Jung Hyuk came into her life. She opens up to him, teaches him a lot of stuff, laughed, smiled and became really warm-hearted to, started to take breaks from work and eat with other people like she never done before!??And when it comes to sacrifice their lives for each other it's just so sweet and adorable!!???? He sacrificed his life for her once and protected her all the time, and she even protected him once! It's just so adorable how much they care and protect each other. And I'm ever more happy for them when they're dating irl!!????Again, one of the best k-dramas I've watched so far! Loved the chemistry between all of the actors, in this k-drama they have a bit older persons, it's usually actors between 20-35 but they're over that and it makes the drama even more amazing and better than the others!??????",10
East Asia,"Honestly this drama was one of the best parts of 2020 for me and introduced me into the fascinating world of Korean dramas. This drama has captivated the world because of three main factors I believe:1) It beautifully showcases the deep divide between North and South Korea, while not demonizing the people of the North as one would expect. It many ways, its a love story between two peoples not just the characters of Yoon Seri and Captain Ri.2) The writing: romance, action, thriller, comedy, the script balances all these aspects so well. You are laughing one moment and in tears the next. Managing intricate storylines and dozens of characters over 16 hour + long episodes can be challenging, and to do in a way that keeps the audience engaged is noteworthy. If you watch enough kdramas, you realize most drop their quality half way through but CLOY draws you in from beginning to end.3) The Cast: a story like this heavily relies on the chemistry of the leads and the production really scored with Hyun Bin and Son YeJin. Both are veteran Korean actors and it shows. Even though they are characters in their mid 30s, there is a lack of intimacy in this drama that would be frustrating in Western shows but somehow it works here. Luckily these two actors display more chemistry is staring at each other 2 feet apart than most actors do in love scenes. They play off each other so well and really just justice to their characters. The supporting cast is just as strong. From the village aujummas to the soldier squad in NK, to Seri's family and employees in SK, you'll find many wonderful characters.",10
East Asia,"Oh man where do I even begin? This show has the perfect balance of drama and comedy, I find myself glued to the seat wanting more and more after each episode, it is truly a beautiful illustration of love, friendship, and family.",10
East Asia,"The storyline is amazing the plot is well writen there are funny/goofy/romantic/dramatic moments the tv series is a complete package, the cast is so lovable and the chemistry beetween Hyun Bin and Son Ye-Jin is superb, truly breathtaking and the most terrific drama i have EVER seen !!! DROP EVERYTHING YOUR DOING AND WATCH THIS TV SERIES NOW

East Asia,Even I hate romantic web series.. but this series awesome.. please watch.. Bhai Korean dramas to dhamal macha rhe hai India...,10
East Asia,It has been several weeks since I watched the last episode of Crash Landing on You and I am utterly shocked by how much I miss these characters.,10
East Asia,"Romantic comedies are easy to like and consume. Usually, nothing particularly profound happens, but they stir your emotions and deliver some good laughs. The Hollywood versions come in many shapes and sizes, but still tend to be a bit formulaic.Crash Landing on You uses many of the same devices as a Hollywood rom com, but it's set in such an unlikely context: South Korean woman, North Korean man, with the story spanning the border between the two nations, adding political, cultural and economic intrigue. It's not that cross-border rom coms haven't been done before, with culture clashes being one the elements of the romantic interest; it's actually been done many times. What makes this story different is the nature of the relationship between North and South Korea, which puts funny, crazy, and downright dangerous constraints on a romance. The writers make this a central element of the plot, and do it beautifully. It leaves them with no shortage of villains, unlikely allies, and all kinds of plotlines to work with.The characters are endearing. The two leads are beautiful, apart or together. Performances are generally excellent. I'm watching with subtitles, and it's not my culture, so it's a bit hard to finely gauge the acting performances, but in general, I think the cast is quite good.It's one of the strangest television experiences I've ever enjoyed. Highly recommend it.",9
East Asia,I loved it verymuch .It's the best K-Drama availabe on Netflix . Mind blowing . Most recommended.,10
East Asia,The problem is that this was the first Korean drama that I ever seen and now whatever I watch it seems to me at least lower.,10
East Asia,"I just finished watching this drama and it gives an amazing feeling and keeps your heart warm. This drama will make you laugh,cry,love and all such things will give you a memorable feeling. You won't feel like fast forwarding in any episode, each episode will leave you wanting more. Everytime I think about this drama there is a warm feeling in my heart. The dialogues are mesmerising the cast is superb and everything about it is so good which makes me wonder if any drama will be able to reach its level. I'm not telling anything about the plot or storyline though I would've liked some changes in the ending this drama is nothing less than a masterpiece. You will regret if you don't watch this, you can cherish every moment in this drama wholeheartedly.",10
East Asia,"After three reviews here, I felt I am being unfair for not sharing my impression of «Crash Landing on You». I watched it last year when Netflix had it on its list. I was hooked completely by this series that I've been a follower of South Korean dramas ever since.I've seen «Crash Landing on You» three times... the last one with me doing some fast forwarding to the scenes where the two leading stars are in it. Hyun Bin & Son Ye-jin tandem is one of the most perfect couples I've ever watched on screen! Their chemistry in this drama was unforgettable ??. The scriptwriter may have these two in mind when the story popped out; or maybe the manuscript was actually written for them purposely. Mr. Hyun Bin, with his charismatic smile, handsome face, debonaire personality and his awesome performance as Capt. Ri captivated the hearts of many, including me. No age limit (I'm a grandma). Miss Son Ye-jin, with her beauty and outstanding acting... what can you ask for more? Oh, Yes...the supporting casts were awesome too! The cinematography was wonderful. The soundtrack was fantastic. Kuddos of course to the director and to the screenwriter.I am still a fan of South Korean dramas. Thanks to «Crash Landing on You» for opening my eyes to their film-tv-music world. The country seems to have a lot to offer. If it was not of the pandemic, I would have visited South Korea last year. It is still on my bucket list.",10
East Asia,I really hope there is a second season. Acting is far better than anything on NZ tv. Kept me in suspense the entire time. Casting was superb. Highly recommend to anyone who likes good drama. But why did I cry so much?,10
East Asia,"It would be crime if I don't give a review of this wonderful show! What an amazing story, direction and acting! Romance, Thriller, Adventure, Fighting everything is there! Just a perfect package!",10
East Asia,Anothervbest series of k-drama. Crash landing on you is best combination of drama and entertainment this is best show for all keep it up dragon cinema...,10
East Asia,"A 10 here wouldn't necessarily mean perfect. There are some obvious cliches, particularly the amount of coincidences that happen in this show but the show still delivers right through it. The relationships between the cast, I can't quite describe it. I can't even comment if that's what I would expect when comparing North vs South but the consistency through the show is spot on!We're not even done yet, and I'm not sure what to expect with the ending but we're almost there and still continue to appreciate each episode (especially as it gets longer through the season!) Actually the only thing I can't stand at this point is that we're almost out of episodes to watch.",10
East Asia,I created an IMDB account just to rate this series and write a review. I cannot watch another show after watching this series. I cannot move on from this series. I literally cried at many scenes. I loved the show very very much. I love the couple of Yoon Seri and Captain Ri Jung Hyuk. Absolutely infinity ratings to this series.,10
East Asia,"I just created an IMDB account just to review this series and rate it 10 out of 10. I cannot watch another shows after watching this series. I don't think I will be able to move on from this series. I am just in love with series and the characters very much. I usually don't cry on any emotional scenes. BUT THIS SERIES. OH MY GOD!!!. I literally cried at many scenes. BEST ACTING BY ""SON YE-JIN"". A perfect couple of SON YE-JIN and HYUN BIN. I just want to rate this infinity stars. LOVE!!!!!!!!!",10
East Asia,"Very first K-drama I watched. And, got hooked to!Beautifully made!",10
East Asia,Aftr i a long i cried soo much... Nd laugh too... ???? Thanks to all the makers nd actors 4 making such a beautiful Drama..,10
East Asia,"This has been a breath of fresh air. What an incredible show. Actors, story, setting, humour etc and the side characters are brilliant along with the main 2.. Would recommend definitely.",10
East Asia,"This was my first korean drama and i must say i don't know what to look for after this it took my heart away when it ended and i feel like i'll always remember this, this show is the perfect example of how love should be and the only thing bad about this show is when it ends it makes you feel like you lost a family or someone you loved and you'll miss them endlessly.",10
East Asia,I've been watching a lot of k-dramas recently on Netflix. I'm British so it's subtitled and I know nothing about Korea but I love them and this one is one of the best! It's suspenseful and the acting is amazing. I cried through most of the last episode. There are some action/fight scene that were really good as well. Overall just a brilliant series.,10
East Asia,"It is the second Korean film I watched and the first drama. I already like Prison playbook but this one - holy shit!I often wonder if these two main characters are actually married or a couple as the energy between them is so electrifying, unbelieveable.Not knowing what to expect and not usually into romantic shows or movies, this one is really amazing!Need to admit it is slow at times and one episode to be around 90 mins is VERY long and so takes quite a bit to finish one episode. That seems to be normal for K-dramas.Still I love it and hell the chemistry is just so wow and the acting also first class! Romantic without being Hallmark-cheesy!Gonna look for more like this on Netflix.",9
East Asia,"I have watched Korean Movies during College days and I was fascinated by their impeccable style of story telling. Amid Pandemic, K-Dramas were getting popular in India. And The Crash Landing on you is right on top of all K Dramas. The Story line is incredibly strong to evoke vibrant emotions among viewers. The Lead pair had done commendable job to bring this story alive. The cinematography, particularly the North Korea set up was infatuating.I didn't realize that the series has 16 episodes and each episode consist of more than an hour. The Writer and Director must be praised and patted on shoulder to maintain the theme of the story and brought it to its logical conclusion.This is definitely must watch series.",9
East Asia,This Drama is all about ture Love ??.... emotions and patriotism towards ... one's country....,10
East Asia,"I don't write reviews but I absolutely had to for this wonderful series. I am a guy and I am more interested in normal drama/action/mobster movies and series. It's not that I dislike the romance genre (I enjoy it when done well) but I just never preferred media that is strictly romance. For the past few months I was familiar with the plot of CLOY because of all the time spent scrolling through Netflix, and I always thought it sounded like it could be interesting. I was mostly interested in how the portrayal of North Korea was going to play out, and this would be my first K-Drama. One day I decided to go ahead and just watch it, and little did I know I was starting something that would literally change me. I was not expecting this roller coaster of emotions.It's only been about 4 days since I finished CLOY but I still think about it every day. It's one of those shows that you don't just watch, you experience. I was absolutely hooked once the ball started to get rolling later in the first episode. At first it came across as a corny show; there were some hilariously bad special effects and some goofy characters / dialogue. I was thrown off by that because I was expecting a much more serious tone. But at the end of the first episode you are very intrigued, and by the end of the second episode you are addicted. The show is so very full of life, and what was ""corny"" at first turns quickly turns into charm. (The special effects do get better) This show has a charm that is unmatched by any show I've seen. It knows when and where to be serious, funny, calm, thrilling, suspenseful, romantic, intriguing, and sad at the right moments.By far, the two main characters (Captain Ri and Seri) steal the limelight. The supporting cast is amazing and could have been an entire show on their own, but the chemistry between Ri and Seri is unrivaled. Jim and Pam from The Office are nowhere near the power couple these two are. When I think of the show all I think of is their journey together and nothing else. That's how amazing their performances were. You could literally FEEL the emotions through the screen like they were right in front of you. You can feel these characters develop throughout the entirety of the show, and there is never a dull moment in the entire series. You feel the love they have for each other and you feel the pain that they have to go through. You want them to be happy together. I can't recall any relationship in a show that was as amazing as this one.NON-SPECIFIC SPOILER ALERT: I would say the ONLY flaw with this show is how the story ends in the final 20-30 minutes. It felt extremely rushed, and I was left with more questions than answers. It seemed like an odd way for things to wrap up and the characters seemed a little too okay with it. That being said, it doesn't take away from the quality of the show.As for how I feel this show changed me: it taught me, someone who enjoys being single, the importance of loving someone. It makes me want to be the best version of myself in all aspects. When I finished watching this show, I felt an emptiness inside of me I haven't felt in a long time. I became so attached to the world of CLOY and before I knew it it was over. It was like a girl I had fallen for had said goodbye and left me. There are actually threads online talking about ""Post CLOY depression"" for people feeling the same emptiness after watching the show. I am unsure of how long these feelings will last, but no show has ever made me feel this way. I would have never expected a simple 16 episode TV show would have such an effect on me.CLOY is a powerful show that I believe I will cherish forever. If you are thinking of watching this show prepare for an experience you will never find anywhere else.",10
East Asia,Ek number fantastic mind blowing extra ordinary heart touching love storyLove from india.,10
East Asia,"Maybe I shouldn't have tried to watch this so soon after finishing Mr. Sunshine, but this k-drama turned out to be a big miss for me.I'm generally not a big fan of romance, unless it's handled well and not too over the top. However, from the very first second, this series feels like a generic rom-com.This series could have been really suspenseful, heart-wrenching and spectacular, yet they went crazy with the jokes and downplayed the gravity of the actual situation (which was pretty dire if you think about it).In the first two episodes (the only ones I've watched), the main character makes some pretty dumb decisions, which is understandable given the circumstances. But instead of portraying her panic and fear, they made her seem really ""quirky"". Oh look haha, she takes the wrong turn, how funny and stupid of her!No, I had hoped for a thrilling, interesting and maybe even romantic story, but instead it turned out to be a rom-com...",5
East Asia,"Seriously in 10 years this is my first romance comedy show I have ever watched till the end and wanted it not to end ...
The chemistry and comic timing is super .All the Hollywood peeps , watch this and get ready for a happy ride ??",9
East Asia,"What can I say about Crash Landing on You? I was recommended by a Korean friend and (having never watched a Kdrama before) had no idea what to expect, but I was hooked from the first episode. I can't remember the last time, if ever, I was so invested in a show and its characters. Finishing was actually painful for me, because I felt heartbroken to leave them behind; I missed the people like I miss dear friends. The romance is of course the best part - more on that - but the secondary and tertiary characters, the script, the humor, the pathos, and the direction are all delightful and enthralling. I won't repeat what others have said; I just want to explain what makes this love story so special.First, the chemistry between Yon Se-jin and Hyun Bin is unlike anything I have ever seen on screen. They are both amazing actors independently; the range of emotions that each is able to express with total realism is extraordinary. There are very few actors who can portray humor and pathos equally well but these two do it with ease, going back and forth between lightheartedness and heartbreak seamlessly. But when they are together - I don't know how else to describe it except to say they shine like the sun.Second, I love the way the romance develops. The length of the show and each episode really gives space for a slow, slow burn that is delicious to experience. And more importantly, it's believable. Too often movies and tv shows throw together two beautiful leads who fall in love without any realistic reason. Either they quarrel for three-fourths of a movie and then have a total change of heart out of the blue, or they fall in love at first sight - both of which are easy cop-outs.With Yoon Se-ri and Ri Jeong Hyuek, however, you see their relationship evolve over time and their attraction makes sense. He falls for her playfulness, spirit, and open heart; she falls for his honor, courage, and kindness. He helps her become more compassionate and caring for others; she helps him express his feelings and find humor and joy in life. It's amazing to behold - to see how they make each other more complete and WHY they are so well-matched.Finally, I wish every Western director would take note: you can show two people are in love without graphic and explicit sex scenes (I'm looking at you, Bridgerton). These two barely touch, but you can see their passion and adoration just from the way they look at each other, and that's 10x more powerful than showing skin. It's worth recognizing the skill it takes to do that - if there was an award for facial acting they'd both win hands-down - to express love with just eyes and a quirk of the lips. Of course, there does reach a point when the lack of touching strains credulity, especially once the story relocates to Seoul, but I suppose that's as much to do with the conservative nature of Korean society and what's acceptable on television as anything.There are many other reasons to watch this show, but the romance is, of course, the heart and soul. I love this show. I want to watch it again and again, and I probably will. I am so sad that I will never get to experience it for the first time again, but I will always be grateful that I got to live in Yoon Se-ri and Ri Jeong Hyeuk's story for a time. Thank you, CLOY, for letting me experience this journey.",10
East Asia,"It's the modern day version of Romeo and Juliet, only more interesting. Captain Ri Jung and Yoon Se-ri truly know love. It was refreshing to see two lovers in their mid thirties, scarred and jaded at one level and yet so beautifully innocent and hopeful.The story is dramatic, of course, but with a little suspension of disbelief, it's truly engaging and free of any major plot holes.I have laughed and cried with so many characters in the show, I was actually a little sad when it ended, I needed more of their love.Definitely a show worth watching.",10
East Asia,"Something fresh and great to watch. Great story, Great Direction, Great Cinematography. Beautiful Music,",8
East Asia,This is the best K-Drama of all time - nothing left to say here.,10

East Asia,Simply outstanding. Go and watch all the episodes. You wouldn't regret.Still can't get over this masterpiece.So real and emotional.,10
East Asia,"One of the best shows I have ever watched! A famous CEO of a prosperous fashion company from South Korea gets caught up in a storm while paragliding, which lands her in North Korea. There she meets a patrolling officer who hides her from the government officials in search for her, and falls in love with her in the process. The plot, the love story, the music, the dialogue I mean it is all incredible. There's drama, there's action, and there's love.",10
East Asia,"Crash landing on you was my first kdrama and it totally deserves the best. Unique and amazing script makes you laugh , cry and love all the characters. All supporting roles were so good. Also, the lead couple had so much chemistry. Beautiful ost too. I would like to see this drama again and again.I just was a little disappointed from the finale and that's why I don't give 10/10. Totally recommended to everyone. One of the best kdramas of all time.",9
East Asia,This is one of the best romantic drama and I suggest you watch this one time it's full of love .,10
East Asia,"I don't know if this is a good thing or a bad thing but this is one of the very few shows which actually gave me a Post-Series Depression..The chemistry, story, cliffhangers, slow mo, everything.... Is perfect.",9
East Asia,Here's a show I would just pass on but it got great reviews so I took a shot. Only the Koreans could pull off such an implausible premise. But I Love it! Another spectacular love story. Really good job.,9
East Asia,Just do yourself a favour and watch this amazing series.Hyun Bin and the Son Ye Jin!!!,10
East Asia,"CLOY was my first K-Drama and I FELL IN LOVE! Such a well done production, terrific story line, and charming and beautiful actors. I found it very entertaining and a refreshing change from the same old drek of Hollywood and cable shows. Really enjoyed it, every minute of it. Got me started on my journey through KDramas and I've probably watched about 50 since watching CLOY in May 2020. I haven't watched a US show since that time.",10
East Asia,I have loved every minute of this! It's a slow burner and I would recommend watching an episode or two before you make a decision on it. It's a really beautifully told love story. It's made me laugh and it's made me cry. I can't recommend it enough.,10
East Asia,"Worth for watching..,... I am little disappointed in ending... But that is not bug deal.... Everything is very good.",9
East Asia,"It's been more than 2 weeks since I last finished this show and I'm still thinking about it.The acting, directing, cinematography,music,OSTs,characters,emotions, chemistry between the leads all are top notch.I'm still in tears listening to the OSTs reliving the show through the memories. It started of as a light interesting plot show but it got too deep with emotions that I'm still mesmerized by it.I cried and cried for days ( first time in my life).I'm still not convinced by the ending (2 weeks really?).Still it made my heart warm and gave me comfort so it deserves all the praises.Probably the best Show(not just kdrama) I have ever watched.",10
East Asia,"To begin with , this show centres around the values of humanity and unity of people torn by political boundaries through a unrealistic love story. The story seems to be well-written and implemented on the screen and it has many good thrilling , romantic and hilarious scenes which adds to the brilliance of the show. The actors were amazing in playing there respective roles and I would like to praise the special entry of Kim-So Hyun as a division 11 guy working as delivery boy. The actions were good considering it a 13+ age group show. Other than that, it brings out some interesting facts about North Korea which you will counter for instance, the train journey and find out more by yourself. Also, it shows how a cultural interaction would be between North Korea and South Korea and the gaps there.As for cons, I found it a bit boring after episode ten and episodes seemed quite stretched but all is well that ends well. More of such works are expected from the Korean industry and international companies like Amazon prime or Netflix should bring such amazing content to other countries. In the end, I would say that this show would remain in my memory for a long time.",9
East Asia,Bro just go ahead and watch it.... it's the best after breaking bad..,10
East Asia,"This series starts out a little cheesy and superficial setting the scene in the beginning, but once the 2 lead characters meet and the real story starts, it's hard to stop watching. The series is filled with compelling characters that provide a lot of complimentary storylines and comic relief. The chemistry of the 2 leads will suck you in and having you on a roller coaster of emotions following their beautiful story. It might be a little cheesy at times, but it's a quality production that lets you enjoy looking at life through a rosy Korean lens.",10
East Asia,"YOU can definitely watch this drama , Story , acting all are superb. Comedy , emotions , action all together here , you can definitely enjoy this drama. Ending is superb I like this from beginning to ending.",10

East Asia,"Yoon Se-ri (Son Ye-jin) is a South Korean chaebol heiress to the Queen's Group. However, her existence threatens her elder half-brothers and she is intensely disliked by her stepmother so she steps away from the family business and successfully founds her own fashion and beauty company, Seri's Choice, which makes her independently wealthy.Se-ri's father, who was recently released from jail and can no longer run the Queen's Group, wants Se-ri to take over. He favors her over her brothers, whose leadership and skills are no match to her talent and business acumen.As the Queen's Group prepares to make the official announcement, Se-ri goes out paragliding to test her latest line of extreme sportswear and is caught in a sudden tornado, which blows her over the Korean Demilitarized Zone and into North Korea, where she has a fateful encounter with Captain Ri Jeong-hyeok (Hyun Bin).Desperate to go home, Se-ri escapes capture from Captain Ri and his four patrol officers and accidentally makes her way to his stationed village, where they meet again. He shields her from intelligence authorities led by Cho Cheol-gang (Oh Man-seok) who were alerted to the presence of an intruder.Meanwhile, Se-ri's elder brother Se-hyung (Park Hyung Soo) becomes chairman and his wife, Sang-ah (Yoon Ji-min), wants to take over Se-ri's company. When Se-hyung hears from his North Korean contacts that his sister is still alive, he and his wife take active measures to prevent her from returning.Captain Ri takes Se-ri into his own home and enlists the aid of his four officers to protect her from Cho Cheol-gang. He also makes plans to smuggle her back to South Korea. Their first attempt by boat fails miserably when they are spotted by the coast guard. On their second try, he helps Se-ri secure a slot on a North Korean team headed to Europe for a friendly games tournament. In between these efforts, she makes new friends in the village and begins to appreciate their old-fashioned, simpler ways of life.Their plans are discovered, and Captain Ri is shot by Cho Cheol-gang's men in a highway confrontation. Se-ri drives the badly injured Jeong-hyeok to the hospital, giving up her chance to flee. He recovers and is angry at her failed escape, but his anger turns to gratitude when he is told she donated blood that helped save his life. By this time, the two of them can no longer hide their growing feelings for each other.Jeong-hyeok's fiancé, Seo Dan (Seo Ji Hye), returns home from musical conservatory studies in Russia and discovers Jeong-hyeok is protecting Se-ri. She uncovers proof of Se-ri's wealthy family background and reports this to Captain Ri's father. To help his son and appease his future daughter-in-law's family, Director Ri organizes a fake border patrol search for an alleged deserter. This provides cover for Se-ri, who is safely escorted by Jeong-hyeok and his men to a path across the DMZ line.Sang-ah calls an emergency board meeting and asks the members to vote in favor of a merger between Seri's Choice and Queen's Group, but Se-ri arrives at the meeting just in time, halting the vote. She resumes control of the business and returns to her opulent but empty life, and finds herself missing Captain Ri and her time in North Korea.Up north, Ri Jeong-hyeok finds mounting evidence of Cho Cheol-gang's racketeering and direct involvement in his brother's murder. Cheol-gang is brought to trial and found guilty, but successfully escapes on the way to prison. Jeong-hyeok realizes Cho Cheol-gang has crossed the border and sensing Se-ri's life might be in danger, he follows in pursuit and also crosses the border via an underground tunnel.Jeong-hyeok reunites with Se-ri, who builds a cover story for him as her new bodyguard and introduces him to the comforts of her luxurious life in Seoul. She connects with city gang members to help locate Cho Cheol-gang.Director Ri sends his son's men to retrieve Jeong-hyeok. After hiding out in an overnight jjimjilbang and a few near-encounters, Captain Ri and his men finally reunite. A grateful Se-ri takes care of them, providing them with food and shelter and sends them on a shopping spree.Cheol-gang, alerted by Sang-ah of Se-ri's residence, tries to capture her, but Jeong-hyeok's team protects her. She is critically wounded in a confrontation between Cheol-gang and Jeong-hyeok, but survives. When Se-ri's father learns about Se-hyung's and Sang-ah's misdeeds through a recording which was provided by Man-bok, he takes away the chairmanship from his son and kicks them out of the family. Se-hyung blames his wife for their situation and she decides to inform the National Intelligence Service (NIS) of Se-ri's North Korean activities.Cheol-gang is killed by the NIS, but Captain Ri and his company are detained. Jeong-hyeok takes full responsibility and lies to the authorities that he manipulated Se-ri for his own gain. This would absolve Se-ri and his company of all potential crimes. However, the NIS finds no incriminating behavior and even offers amnesty to the North Koreans and help to get settled in Seoul, but they decline and decide to return home. Both governments agree to a quiet prisoner exchange and Se-ri is exonerated of any crimes. Her stepmother, having reconciled with Se-ri, drives Se-ri at high speed to the exchange, where Se-ri gets to see Jeong-hyeok one last time before saying goodbye for good.As Seung-jun is about to depart from North Korea, he learns that Dan is being held captive and he goes to save her. He succeeds but is shot. Dan professes her love during the ambulance ride but he dies in her arms. She grieves over his death and decides to avenge Seung-jun and catch the culprits. Ultimately, she finds evidence that Sang-ah and Se-hyung had used Cho Cheol-gang for their own purposes, which leads to their arrest by the joint task force of National Intelligence Service and the Seoul Police. Dan tells her parents that she will never marry and intends to continue her musical career.Three years later, Se-hyung remains in jail and files for divorce. Se-ri continues managing Seri's Choice and her other half-brother, Se-jun, is the Chairman of Queen's Group, with the day-to-day business being handled by a professional CEO.Before Jeong-hyeok left, he programmed a series of text messages for Se-ri with some help from the chief of National Intelligence Service. He teaches her how to lead a better lifestyle and to enjoy life with the people around her. Se-ri's tough boss image drops and she becomes a nicer and generous CEO to the people under her. One day, while landing from paragliding in Switzerland, she finds Jeong-hyeok in front of her. He has since been discharged from the military and has come to Switzerland to represent North Korea as a pianist. This would become a path where both can be together.Se-ri creates a musical scholarship foundation that supports talented underprivileged children from around the world, with headquarters in Switzerland. She appoints Jeong-hyeok as a director of her foundation; every year he spends two weeks in Switzerland on foundation business and as a judge in the final competition for scholarships. Se-ri is also a director of her foundation, and every year spends the same two weeks with Jeong-hyeok, with whom she finally finds love and happiness.",10
East Asia,I love this web series so much. Everyone should watch it.,10
East Asia,"I loved this series so much!!! It's spectacular! I used to judge Korean TV because I usually only watch American stuff and I thought it wouldn't be good or too cliche, but I'm fascinated now. I can say that it's one of my fav series now. Captain Ri and Yoon Se-ri have such a strong chemistry that I get goosebumps every time they stare at each other. Love them so much! Also, it's such a funny show, I laughed multiple times with Captain Ri crew hahahah they are hilarious! I would recommend everyone to watch it, but be aware, cause you are going to fall in love and get addicted!!! 10 stars.",10
East Asia,"I can't stop rewatching this and thinking about the characters. I just started watching K dramas after a long time as a fan of Indian cinema. CLOY is amazing, far surpassing my expectations. The script, acting, cinematography, costumes and settings are all exquisitely detailed. Everything rings true, even things that are meant to be humorous. If you are sick of the pointless cruelty, inanity, fake sentimentalism, and violence that tend to be the stuff of Hollywood and you long to fall in love with characters who are complex and believable then do yourself a favor and invest your hours in this extraordinary drama. Yes there are parts that are contrived but all in the service of good storytelling. The acting, particularly between the leads, sizzles. Hyun Bin and Son Ye-Jin, who apparently are an item in real life, calibrate this love story with depth and finesse. I hope they won't be seduced by Hollywood-it doesn't deserve them! I am always on the lookout for high quality films and television from around the world. Few other works have involved me so deeply. And the soundtrack deserves special mention as well. Just a great experience!",10
East Asia,"...this series have more than 8,5? The plot is so bland. It started very promising with this female lead character who was about to be the new president of the family company without the support of most of her relatives but her father. And then the tragedy happened... And started the boring plot of the girl landind in North Korea by accident. That also seems interesting to watch, I mean its North Korea. But no, its not what I wanted it to be. So unworthy to watch.",4
East Asia,"The reason i saw this show was because someone told me,"" watch this show even if you are not into k dramas"". That person was right. Some people call this show too cheesy. On the other hand i heard most of the people cried while watching this show. Just the fact that they were able to make people cry without showing any intimate scene, is enough to judge a show. And in order to achieve this kind of emotional connect with the audience, you have to be a little cheesy but it is not fair to underrate it for being cheesy.I personally liked it alot.",10
East Asia,"I'm at 12th episode , and I seriously don't want it to end.please suggest me more such series.",10
East Asia,It is my first Kdrama n I randomly started watching it n now I m a fan of the drama n all the actors. Such an emotional series????,10
East Asia,I have never watched Korean dramas in my life but this one has changed my perception about these. I literally fell in love with their culture. Both Seri and Ri have done superb acting and their chemistry was unmatched.,10
East Asia,"I want more episodes, each and every character is touched my soul. In this show you can feel romance, thrill, action, sadness, comedy everything, I can't get over of this show. Its highly recommend ??",10
East Asia,"I am speechles!!!! There are more than 17k people review it, nothing left to tell about this drama... Just watch it ASAP???????? it is 1000% worth to give time...",10
East Asia,"This definitely takes the award for the best Netflix series I've ever watched.I was hooked from the first five minutes and couldn't stop watching it.I loved all of the characters. It's such a beautifully and cleverly produced love story.One minute you are laughing out loud, the next minute you have tears streaming down your cheeks. Get the tissues ready!I rarely write reviews but this one deserved it. Thank you, thank you, thank you to everyone who was involved in this production. Bravo!",10
East Asia,Ehhh I've seen better. Don't waste your time watching it. Especially if someone suggests it...,1
East Asia,"I just can't believe this series. It makes me want to cry, laugh, smile, get mad and then back to crying all over again. The scenes are very unpredictable. I love the roles of the supporting actors as well. This has by far the best korean drama i have ever seen. It has been 2 weeks already since my last episode but i just can't seem to move on yt. Forever inlove with the characters!!",10
East Asia,"Well I watched many korean movies and i am not intrested in k drama. But I came across movie named be with you, moment to remember and some son je jin movies. Finally I got this CLOY. I had best feeling ever... All of them executed well there roles. Especially both hyun bin and son je jin. Must watch for who loves dramas.",10
East Asia,"This is one of the finest show covering geopolitical tensions and complexities with soulful love story full of drama, action and very good storyline. I loved every episode and recommended to many of my contacts who loved it to core too. Highly recommend!",10
East Asia,Loved it!! I would watch this on repeat. I wish there was another season.,10
East Asia,"Beautiful. I sobbed through every teardrop shed on the drama. Acting superb. Captain Ri! He's gorgeous. I'm a retired high school math teacher in SC, USA. Actress playing Se-ri, her facial expressions and her heart bleeding for every one but herself. Ive only watched a couple of the K-Drama series. Crashed Into You has been the best.Why don't K-Dramas end with marriage, children, bright futures? I need a nap now. Great writing, acting, scenery, LOVED EVERY SECOND!",10
East Asia,"When someone recommended this show to my sister and I, we were very hesitant to watch it, but desided to give it a try.After episode two, we were hooked. We got to episode 6, and had to stop watching it for a month due to having some trouble with Netflix (if you have seen the show and remember the cliffhanger ending for episode six you know that was not easy) so I bought it for my sister for christmas on disc (before I was half way through it).We desided to try and get my two teenage brothers and our adult sister to watch it with us, because we were sick of them making fun of us for loving it so much.We finally convinced them to watch it, and they were also hooked after episode two. My brothers said they weren't, but they were bitterly dissapointed whenever we didn't watch it. One night we were so busy it was 2 am by the time we were finished. We desided to watch it anyway, so I went and told my brothers (who were asleep) that we were going to watch it, and they jumped out of bed and we watched it on a computer because the TV would be too loud. Another night we also couldn't use the TV because it would wake our family, and the laptop was dead, so the four of us watched it on my sister's phone (my other brother thought we desided not to watch it so he went to bed, he was so angry when he found out we watched it without him.)
After I had finished the drama, I wanted to show it to my younger sisters and mom, she had been making fun of us for loving the show, so she made up excuses for a month why not to watch it. One night my sisters really wanted to watch it and my mom had no excuse so she said,
""Let's just get this silly show over with, then.""
After the first episode she said it ""wasn't really her type"" But soon she was hooked too. She even start copying the characters faces while we were watching it.If you go on her Netflix feed, all it is is korean dramas.We've since watched many other korean dramas, most of which I loved, but this show beats them all.I've seen the show four times and it's been a year since I started it, and I still love as much as I did the first time. I've recommended the show to 15 people, some who were extermly determined not to like it at all, and everyone of them loved it. The show only gets better and better as it goes on, the OST is AMAZING, the hilarious and loveable company five is the second best thing about this show, after the beautiful love story between Yoon Se-ri and Ri Jeong Hyeok. I 10/10 recommend this drama. Who knows? You might have just found your new favorite show.",10
East Asia,No chemistry between the actors. The female lead doesn't show much expression on her face.,1
East Asia,"If you're looking for a drama with a different storyline and a different atmosphere it would be a perfect choice. There is always a beautiful smile on my face each time I watch an episode. It's an entertaining combination of fluff, romance, drama, and political/police procedural. It shows the humanity in all echelons of society, from poor to rich, from communist to capitalists, from military to playboy. The chemistry is incredible, the emotions are real, and the casting is perfect. Watching the show brings you the joy of being alive.",10
East Asia,"This show is a reminder of what true love is in the age of modern day relationships. At every goodbye, your heart aches, and at every union your heart rejoices. The beautiful sound-tracks, the mesmerizing locations and the intriguing plot have been the core of entire series. It also keeps the romance, adventure and humour alive throughout. I wish I had watched this series sooner, but I am glad I watched it anyway. Would definitely recommend it to all viewers across the globe.",10
East Asia,"It is most beautiful journey. Everything in this is so beautiful, I want this masterpiece to forever be in my memories. One of the best ever for me.",10
East Asia,"This is the best korean drama I have ever watched what a love, what a sacrifice, what a pure love in this web series we all love this I have no words.",10
East Asia,"Push ""fast-forward"" button so many time. Some scene are just too cheesy and predictable. The conversation is just too slow.",1
East Asia,"This is the second Korean series I've ever watched and not gonna lie, my expectations weren't high at all. But it surprised me with a different (even though it had some logical mistakes) and touching story. It was not only about love, but also about friendship, family and faith in good things. It took me so long to finish (I watched it literally nonstop) because episodes are very long. Hence it takes you to a really long journey during which you sometimes cry and sometimes laugh. Loved it.",9
East Asia,I loved the male lead in secret garden so was looking forward to this one but it's a complete disappointment.First he could not express for most of the series except a few scenes. Is it because of too much Botox ?Second didn't like the character of jeong hyuk. Always acting hero to protect the lady are we? Not to mention those text messages with a world of free advice including how to be a good driver.Thirdly the South Korean part of the drama was so cringe. The security agencies acted like match makers.Finally they killed the other guy and ended the only promising love story in the series.Seriously I couldn't care less if they killed the main male lead.,1
East Asia,I just love this drama. I never seen something like this. It's made me a beautiful person from inside and I love Yoon seri ( son ye jin) every single person should watch this before die. It's feel like love.,10
East Asia,"''Crash landing on you '' was my first kdrama and then I got stuck with THEM !Super plot and storyline , sooo funny moments that you can burst into laughs but there are sad moments that can make you cry too
It is a kdrama with full emotionals moments .I loved every single character and the leading couple has soo chemistry and romantic moments!!!AHHH the ost is sooo catchy too!!This kdrams may help you to learn history as it talks for the war of south - north korea and it offers positive messages for the union of north -south Korea .The only thing that prevent me to rate this kdrama with 10/10 is some special effects that it is too much but after 4 episode it stopedI TOTALLY RECOMEND THIS KDRAMA TO ALL OF YOU !!!!",9
East Asia,"Reallity is presented with comedy
...not only rom-com but more than that...i watch it thrice ...i can connect with every small charachters...side stories of people living in the north korean villlage is heart warming and pleasant at the same time...2nd leadcouple love story is also touching..
everything i found perfect..they also add political drama and actions to fetch more male audience from different ages...realism is enough for anyone to watch it once and never regret , never forget type feeling..i sometime felt it is as little bit longer but at the same time i want to see the comic scenes and romentic scenes more and more.Many dialouges are not just dualouges but having deep meaning in them.All actors from big to small fro. 5 min to 5 hour appearance...done a great job..they are fully into it.I think it will become in top20 webseries of the world.If it reaches to more and more people.For that it is must that this become famouse.If we do not consider GOT and vikings type historical fictious and avengers and harrypotter type of super duper fuctious stuff.Crash landing on you will remain in top 10 list in my fav. Webseries list.Which is not much fictious or magical but heart warming and surrounded by harsh reallity and full of very very cute and pleasant stories and movements.Hindi dubbing is also very good ...one can watch it in hindi it will be more interesting..because some comedy hindi proverbs are used in dubbing...I can not found any mistake in this drama
And enjoyed a lot with my family...
I am giving all 10 which i can do.",10
East Asia,"You will gonna thank me for it...
Please watch otherwise your entertainment life will missed a gem.!",10
East Asia,"To say I have become hooked on K-Dramas and films is a massive understatement and in the last few months I have lost count of the number of dramas I have watched. I keep thinking I've seen the best they have to offer, and then another series comes along and blows me away. However, with CLOY, we have been given something really really special, 16 episodes of sheer TV perfection, I haven't come across any tv show English language or foreign that has such brilliant casting, writing, acting, cinematography it literally doesn't put a foot wrong. The two leads were amazing, especially Son Ye-Jin who is one of my favourite actresses and their chemistry was palpable. The storyline is unique with wonderful romance elemements mixed with lashings of top notch action, comedy and thriller scenes. I can't not praise this series enough and I can say in all honestly I was more than a little devastated to say goodbye to these wonderful characters. Do yourself a favour, forget about the crap served up by American and British TV and really check out what K-Drama has to offer, you will not be disappointed.",10
East Asia,"I think CLOY will convert a lot of people to being fans of asian dramas. The pacing of many asian dramas is often so slow (with all the flash backs and 60 second stares when they ""almost kiss"") and it can feel a bit wasteful of your time to take 20 hours, or even 50 to complete.But CLOY is engaging the whole time. It's worth the time. (Full disclosure, I'd probably happily watch 20 hours of Hyun Bin painting walls). Son Yejin is always amazing - and she is fantastic as usual here. Hyun Bin is great too, but his range isn't stretched much (watch him in Secret Garden) he is only being perfect.Some of the best parts of CLOY for me are the scenes with the North Korean characters. I absolutely love the soldiers as well as the ladies from Capt Ri's village. Kim Sun-young is hilarious. The writing is great.I think why I like Korean dramas so much is how they are full of just humans caring well for each other. And the banter. Koreans are masters of beautiful conversation. They leave you feeling full and happy.Watch it! You'll love it.",9
East Asia,Do not trust a kdrama person who doesn't know this drama.,10
East Asia,People who doesn't like this drama are from North Korea!,10
East Asia,"Look what the tornado dragged in.Here's an effort to acknowledge the craft that went into CLOY while gliding around any spoilers.Some of the themes are:??The meaning of true family
{Who said this?: ""That's why I never go to Olive Garden- They treat you like family"" ""True family"" is not about DNA. It illustrates the highest ideals: Loving, providing, protecting, happy over the good stuff, & distressed over the bad stuff life brings our loved ones.}??Survival in an oppressive, despotic situation??Survival in a wealthy, greedy, love-starved, viper pit of a family??Misery, love, loneliness, & warmth are often w/o respect to wealth or social status??Overcoming fear in order to do right??Politics won't beget love??Korean women sure do love a tall man with broad shoulders. (& don't we all?)??Visual Metaphors:
In CLOY's very first shot, a hawk glides on a pendulum strung from heaven, far above politics. Yes, it's emblematic of freedom, but also lifting to the sky. Hawks always look down to swoop onto their prey. Is Se-ri a hawk?? Hmm. Ri's got the??, but is he de-facto prey?When Se-ri fails a ""mission"", Ri loses his temper. SO~ She exits. Decidedly. ??... Ri overhears how Se-ri bravely saved his life... She's been nonstop ??????... Rain falls as /that/ seeps (titit-tat-TAT) in...???CrrAAckk???? We can hear it on his face: OH. NO? I'm in Trouble!????/? Visual Contrasting + Crisp Editing:
The church/phony prayer scene contrasts with NK villagers who seem sincere about their beliefs re their country & the outside world. Compartmentalization? ?? Freedom-&-prosperity-engendered-greed that's twisted the SKs' faith. It's not about who's better. It's a c?ution; a reminder for those of us living in comfortable countries: it isn't politics or even poverty that erodes a person's ""humanity"". Usually it's 1 poor choice... followed by another...We go from a humble, but warm, NK clambake?? to a most appallingly self-aggrandizing & *shame??lessly lavish (yet profoundly unsatisfied) family plotted round the table in ice cold scorn. What is the first true family-time that Se-ri's ever had, we wonder?They just hadda put the villain in that creepy, overcompensating hat. Even bad-guy Cheon Su-bok is skillfully humanized. We can feel the pain in his gasping voice as he recounts that he was an orphan with nothing. It's juxtaposed with the two orphans that appear in the show. These adorable children are in danger of walking his path.??The opulence of Pyongyang is grotesque against the debasement of the little village's starving Children & comrades struggling beneath peasants' standards. Let's not guess about the ominous absence of any cats or dogs in the village.??Wordplay: One of the soldiers is playing video games at the internet café. We see him type: ""I request an alliance."" Cute.?? vs Swallow'Type' is used in more ways than one. They each know what ~rather~ ?WHO? their 'type' is.Did Se-ri crash, fall, drop, or descend? ...?She Swooped!Se-ri talks abt Ri feeling 'pressured.' Given their high-risk crisis of imminent death at the time, it's high comedy.Se-ri sleepily mumbles the ""liking"" gives her a headache. Does she mean liking going home, or is she liking her head on his much coveted shoulder???Repeated Words & Themes For Impact & Foreshadowing are like lyrics:
Was it... Is it Des?T?iny? It descends ? on the entire series with: Meant t? be... Must be fate... Again & again it's destiny.The word ""bodyguard"" dutifully works shifts. Ri bristles when he first hears it, but he had been doing the pedal work already, anyway.Over& over we hear: ""That's just like a ??"" or ""This isn't a ??! That won't work,"" or ""This is just like a ?? from the South."" A soldier obsessed with Kdramas explains/predicts it ALL, based on what he learned by spying on the outpost's ??. ""Dramas in the South always {__X__}."" Kim Ju-meok solves for X every time (esp w/: ""L??verboy!""). He was making connections betwixt Ri+Se-ri+dramas almost immediately, to Ri's unease. That gag never gets old. It strikes a chord with Kdrama fans.??Ri: 'I'm okay'.??Se-ri: 'You always say that' ??... If nothing else, Ri is consistently on tempo.??Reciprocity??:
They play CLOY on the black & white ??. The series' key shift in the 2nd half, treats us to a review, or a tour, of everything Ri did for Se-ri from a fresh angle. ?? shh! ??spoiler order in effect + We don't know who is???????They Understand Romance: These 2 are keyed into eachother. The way he looks at her truly is wistful. She knows when he's feigning sleep even when his comrades don't. Each tries to turn pages for the other; each looks to protect the other. Later, there's yelling over exposing h/hself to danger. Over the course of the show, they mirror, then fit eachother like base & treble. But early on, they can't hear the other's music. Watching their struggles to listen is hilarious. He's usually at a loss over her fine distinctions. Once each of them pronounces ""10 nice words,"" the contrasts become manifest. Afterall, beautiful harmony comes from complimentary keys, not uniform ones.?? Ri's recently honed grim discipline is palpable. He admits he's resigned to never expect happiness. The only tell that he's agitated is some moderate fist clenching. Early on, it doesn't look like he'll strike any wrong keys: He isn't one for breaking the rules or crossing the ??. He seems so stodgy that it almost shocks when, like an eagle, he soars in immediate & decisive action w/ precision timing. His silent frustration & confusion over the descending realization that, now, the rule-breaking may never end. His last of the '10 nice words' is the 1st step in his healing.??Hyun Bin's acting as CPT Ri, is prodigy level. When Se-ri declares Park Kwang-beom the most handsome one of them ""by any criteria,"" Ri has subtle, but clear disappointment on his face. When he sees the patch on his uniform, one corner of his mouth twitches up, & his eyes soften. His command of expression is virtuoso. There's not one stray muscle twitch: He holds a rigid stance for the length of the show. He's a Kpop idol fo-sho.Son Ye-jin is also exceptional as the loquacious Se-ri. She had ?? lines to learn for every 1 Hyun Bin did.??The show used consultants from North 'OZ' to ensure accuracy. It's a peak into the deficiencies & documented wretchedness but, moreso, the ??s. The system in NK is suffocating. Similar to Se-ri's family, everything is currying favor w/ superiors. As demonstrated, it extinguishes love & decency. After an arrest, village marms are terrified to be seen helping the wife, lest they get *arrested(?) too. Even families are encouraged to turn on each other or face prosecution. We see a father whose son is nearly dead, but his mind is on his position (Jun Gook-hwan is the perfect stern father & unflappable official). The ?? has nothing in it. It's just a hollowed out ??. The hospitals don't have blood for transfusions. Even Pyongyang suffers multi-hour rolling blackouts. Supplies are scarce but there's never a shortage of little bullycrats barking for IDs. ??There's a profusion of rules, regulations, & records to the point that /everyone/ is guilty: Queue up! They get you when they want to. Besides actual rule-breaking is the institutionalized corruption, such as when Ri is brought in for questioning & told he's #guilty!?> of whatever they ? declare. Human life isn't cheap there, it's disposable.??Clearly, Ri's father toughened him up. Ri's obviously loving mother composed the finer parts of his nature. Ri & his brother, Mu, exhibit exemplary qualities such as respect, integrity, loyalty & kindness. Ri's a natural leader. His unit reflects his example. (forget that mess on the day Se-ri arrived; that was destined).??Yet, as restrictive as Ri's upbringing plainly was, Se-ri's was even more ??dysfunctional. Both of them are from influential families - yet hers - w/ all that freedom, is worse than his. Despite the odds, the NK siblings in CLOY are more loving than the SK ones. Beware: if we allow it, freedom can corrupt us. But Se-ri, with her skills & being her expansive self, was able to brighten many lives in NK. She even turned a committed Commie into a metrosexual with a bottle of shampoo! Skills, indeed. It's darling to see this little group form a true family.Gotta love that budget. The special effects for the tornado are fabulous. We are treated to no less than 3 paraglides in the ??, all breathtaking. The second paraglide scene is esp gripping.When ?action is called for, they come correct. One scene is a shootout between a ?? & 2 armored ??. They practiced restraint, which boosted the realism. It took 7 or 8 shots to blow up the gas tank! No magic bullets here. The effect played out better than typical action features: That.scene.is.straight.bad@$$! ??segue into theme music??What a man, What a man, What a man???? Sing it, Salt n Peppa?????CLOY has something for all the senses: visual delights, a lovely soundtrack, the taste of fresh roasted corn, clams, & Soju (I could taste it), the hair that smells of flowers, & the feel of tears on our cheeks.Watch it and sigh, laugh, & (s)whoop.Watch it & weep, but no biting thru that??wrapper!And remember, nothing comforts after a good cry like a creamy cup of Swiss??Cocoa.??IMHO?

East Asia,I enjoyed every second of every episode. It is a wonderful K-drama that depicts northern Korea in a lovely human way.I did't give it 10 points because of the poor kiss scenes (watch it and you will agree with me),9
East Asia,It is the Best K drama I ever watched and it has everything there are many romantic series but this one is felt in way more different way.,10
East Asia,"I'll start by saying that I'm not usually a fan of romances, but due to long covid I've been stuck at home more than I used to be and have exhausted most of my usual genres on Netflix. That together with Hyun Bin's beautiful face persuaded me to give this show a try, and I must say I wasn't disappointed. I quickly fell in love with the vibrant set of characters and their respective storylines. It's true that, at times, I had trouble believing that what was depicted was really an accurate depiction of life in North Korea, but if I'd wanted reality I'd have chosen to watch a documentary. The performances of the actors all around were outstanding and I was hooked from the very first episode. Definitely want this show if you're looking for something that'll make you laugh and cry in equal measure.",10
East Asia,"I fell in love with this story. It is original and deeply moving. The actors are so incredibly talented! The cinematography is spectacular. It's filmed in Switzerland, but you will feel like you are in North Korea and South Korea. I felt the main characters love so deeply that my heart ached. Hyun Bin and Son Ye-Jin are phenomenal lead actors. The supporting cast was perfection. This story about an heiress from South Korea landing on an Army officer in North Korea was inspired by an actual event where an actress and three friends accidentally strayed into waters between North and South Korea by boat in the fog. This series is more fantasy than reality. It is an epic love story.",10
East Asia,"I have watched almost 40 dramas till now and this remains my favorite for so many reasons. Top notch acting and chemistry between the leads. The plot is very unique and well written. The side characters make a lot of contribution towards the plot as well. Funny, sad and wholesome at the same time. My Favorite Kdrama couple of all time!",10
East Asia,"I don't know how I ended up watching this show, but I am glad I did. It's funny and heartwarming. I am not familiar with Korean shows, but I just love the premise and the two leads. Recommended.",10
East Asia,No words to describe how good this drama is. Just a spectacular piece of art.,10
East Asia,Never ever have I bothered to write a review of a series or movie BUT several weeks after watching & re-watching this delightful series I felell compelled to do so. This drama/comedy/action show has unforgettable staying power! The leads have palpable chemistry & the supporting cast is truly endearing. The marvelous cinematography & musical score add to the pure enjoyment of my now favorite series!,10
East Asia,The first K drama that I have ever watched ang I loved it.,10
East Asia,"I love it , I'm not going to write down a research here , Just simple and humble , It really is good .",9
East Asia,"When Worlds CollideAfter finally giving the Korean Drama genre a chance, I have to say that my expectations were absolutely blown out of the water. The brilliant writers of Crash Landing on You, were able to create a story that is able to sway your heart at a moment's notice. The drama begins with the lead protagonist Yoon Seri, the successful heiress of a large business company from South Korea, who gets into a paragliding accident and finds herself stranded in North Korea, only to be found by a North Korean military officer, Captain Ri Jeong Hyeok. With the work of the brilliant writers and amazing acting from the cast, we can see how the drama utilizes the concept of contrast to get a much more developed story about two very different people from two very different worlds. At first, their differences were what set them apart, but it turns out to be the very thing that brings them together.One of the many ways that Crash Landing on You utilizes the effect of contrast is its ability to change locations from one to another without it feeling forced or unnatural. The scenery of the film is able to feel like its own character. It takes us from the rural and undeveloped towns of North Korea, to the extreme opposite in the more urban hustle and bustle business life in South Korea. It even manages to take us to the beautiful green landscape of Switzerland that has this very mystical feel to it. As the show progresses, it's able to blend multiple plot lines while incorporating all of these different types of settings. A majority of the story's plot comes from the location itself. Where they are affects them heavily and that gives whatever setting the scene takes place in a unique personified effect. There is one scene in particular where Seri finally makes it back to her luxurious home in South Korea after being trapped in the North for close to a month. She finally is able to relax and unwind, and really reflect on all the differences she faced when living in the North. No more random house inspections from the village security guards, no more random power outages throughout the day, and no more having to take baths in a wooden barrel. It allows us to really feel the gravity of the situation a little bit better since North and South Korea are two extremely different countries.While the contrast in the setting and location plays a big part in the making of this story, the characters themselves may be the biggest contrast there is. The two main protagonists, Yoon Seri, and Ri Jeong Hyeok, are about as different as two people can be. First, we have Yoon Seri, the heiress to a wealthy family in the heart of Seoul, South Korea, who has everything money can buy, with the exception of unconditional love from her parents and siblings. Very similar to other headstrong female leads like Mulan, and Leia Organa, Seri is a very independent, and witty female lead who isn't your typical damsel in distress when it comes to traditional Korean dramas. Then we have Ri Jeong Hyeok, the hard working, calm, cool and collected military captain from North Korea, who grew up as a soft spoken and kind piano prodigy, only to have his world change after grieving the loss of his hero in his older brother. Clashing these two different personalities with each other is a work of magic as we get to see how opposites really do attract. After finding herself stranded in North Korea with no idea how to get out alive, Seri stumbles upon the DMZ, or the demilitarized zone,(area between North and South Korea that divides the two countries and is under heavy military watch) where she literally crash lands into Jeong Hyeok while on patrol. Being the quick witted, fast talking business woman she is, Seri is able to convince Jeong Hyeok that her being there is a mistake and that she needs his help if she's to escape. Jeong Hyeok, being the morally correct person that he is, decides to help her only to find out that the biggest challenge isn't going to be how to send her back to the South, but how to maintain his sanity when he's with her. The pairing of these two opposite personalities leads to some of the most colorful chemistry I've ever seen between two characters that definitely take the show's atmosphere to another level.Being a Korean drama, the show's tone and feel are naturally gonna play towards one genre, however, Crash Landing on You is able to play with different tones and styles that make it so much more diverse. Thanks to the different kinds of contrasts throughout this series, the writers are free to have Seri running and hiding for life from North Korean soldiers, and the next have her drinking and gossiping with the other housewives from a small village. Jeong Hyeok will be shopping for suits off in a South Korean mall in one scene, and then be taking part in an all out brawl of a street fight in another. The show is able to seamlessly weave its way in and out of different tones as the show goes on to feel like a mysterious and secretive spy thriller, to a light hearted fun filled romantic comedy. Crash Landing on You is able to take inspiration from other genres and sprinkle bits throughout the show while still being able to stay true to its Korean drama roots. It allows the show to always feel fresh and give it something unique to stand out of the crowd among other Korean dramas.Crash Landing on You is a wonderful story that takes the viewer on quite the expedition of feelings and emotions that can even appeal to someone who has never watched a Korean drama. With the use of very cleverly placed contrasts throughout the series, the writers take you on a well developed and unique story of worlds colliding. Every character and every emotion is so well understood simply because there's another element in the story that's there to show what it is and what it's not at the same time. How North Korea is such an underdeveloped and rural country yet simplistic and peaceful compared to the fast-paced urbanized and loud country that South Korea is. We can expect to find a good laugh but at the same time shed a tear at any point in the show. It shows us that no matter how different things may seem, it doesn't always mean it's a bad thing.",8
East Asia,"From here now I will only watch Korean series! This is the best I have seen in ages; I love the story, the characters, the romance, the music, the drama and everything. So beautiful!

East Asia,"This series was really great. Really good storyline. I couldn't stop watching. I like humor, action, drama, romance. Although it was fictional, this also had some truth I think. Very good actors and actresses. I laughed and cried so good job!And what a beautiful places in the serie.",9
East Asia,The best K-drama I've ever seen! I 100% recommend it. I learned a lot of things! It won't leave you disappointed. The end it could be more clear but it's ok.,10
East Asia,"After watching a few K-drama, this is the best. This show deserves more than 10 stars. Its so not tiring to watch!This show has everything, the comedy, good humour, suspense, and lastly such a beautiful love story.It's not just a story, it's very well thought through!I never cried so much, this show made cry non-stop!Loved the whole thing, the casts, the sceneries and story-line!Definitely worth binge watching!Did it in 3 days!Will definitely watch again! So beautiful!",10
East Asia,"As an avid kdrama fan, i know what to expect: romance and sob-stories wrapped in a specific theme. This particular one is an epic kdrama spanning north-south korea and switzerland, interweaving scenes between military intrigue, family company politics, romance and daily life in rural villages.The comedy isn't too forced, dialogues are really good, acting is excellent, the conflict is real, action scenes are pretty good, fighting scenes doesn't use slow mo cameras, editing is super tight and no scene is unnecessarily long, story is solid and keeps you interested, not predictable like 99% of the kdramas out thereHyun bin acting as north korean is consisten, perfect, all the way to the accent.Son ye jin's acting as heiress/self-made billionaire is solid, funny and enjoyable to watch.A minus:
1. Some of the action scenes are below hollywood quality. Could've been better.2. The military intrigue is drowned by the conflict between main protagonist vs main antagonist.",10
East Asia,"I laughed with this series
i cried with this series
i lived with this series
ty for make it <3i offer u watch this korean seriesFlower of evilGoblinMy Dangrus wifeHotel de Luna.",10
East Asia,"I recommended this to my British friend who had script writing work experience. For the first 2 episodes, he said this isn't his style - cheesy romantic comedy. But I recommended him to be patient, if you like to write a story.Few weeks later, he texted me ""I am completely addicted to Crash Landing on You !! I blame on you!!!"" Haha succeed !I truly hope that all of you are wishing North and South Korea reunify one day.. and cry with us..",5
East Asia,"Without being biased, concerning culture, religion or ethnicity I believe south Korean romance/adventure movies that have continued with season shows followed by there episodes. These past ten years or soouth korean screen writers, producers, casting, directors and all other pertinent staff that are involved in making korean historic romance/adventure movies are by far to ME continue to be most aspiring and most important a feeling of realism South Korean romance/adventure movies were made based on time period movie depicts. As a filipino American citizen movie enthusiast myself whom enjoys watching romance/adventure movies from all cultures - I must say these past 10 years watching romance/adventure South korean movies my favorites have been 'Mr. Sunshine' 'The King's Affection' 'Crash landing on you'To all south korean people involved making movies such as the ones I mentioned in my fisrt paragraph for many nations to watch - and Im sure I speak for many other movie enthusiasts that are not south korean citizens-keep up these kinds of romance/adventure movies:) Greatly appreciated?????",9
East Asia,"I liked the comedy from the soldiers but that's it , I don't see any chemistry from the main characters. I really don't get the hype. Jus Overrated.Asdfgghjkkkhgsaaasd.",2
East Asia,"I loved this drama. All four main characters are amazing - Ri, Se-ri, Seo Dan, Gu.The only thing that is unbearable is that Gu dies.I loved the vibes and dynamics between the characters; Dan's beautiful outfits; Se-ri's fashion sense and at the end of the last episode, her classic outfits that look perfect; Ri's devotion, kindness, principles. I loved Gu's gentlemanly mannerisms and charms. I was swooning over him.I hope to find a love as strong as amongst these characters one day that will last forever.",7
East Asia,"I never finish any series I've watch before but this one I get addicted I start from the beginning at about 10pm Saturday night end up to stop to watch Sunday 2pm !Every night after work I watch 1 episode before goin to sleep then finally ends to the last episode . I will keep looking for more episodes of crash landing .To captain Ri and Se Ri I'm in love with you both !Se Ri sorry don't get jealous I got crush with good looking captain Ri! Good story of romance funny action with life lessons .I will be waiting patiently for Crash Landing on you Part 2 ! Thumbs up for the director
To Captain Ri and Se Ri I'm now your number 1 American fan !!",10
East Asia,"This K drama is something you should not miss at all. Whether you are beginner in this genre of K Drama but trust me on this.The Drama picks at very good pace where the clear representation of the two Koreas has been displayed.A way too emotional journey for me. I literally CRIED in between episodes.I appreciate the cast, the writer and the director for giving such a wonderful experience in the Romance genre.",10
East Asia,"This was the first kdrama I watched after being hounded by my sister to give it a try. It is as good as it is reputed to be, an emotional roller-coaster of comedy, romance and tear-jerking moments.I was impressed by how well a South Korean drama depicted North Koreans, showing them to be lovable, patriotic and heroic. Ri Jeong-hyeok (Hyun Bin) a captain in the North Korean military and member of an elite family would risk his life and career to keep Yoon Se-ri (Son Ye-jin), a South Korean businesswoman who accidentally fell on North Korean soil in a paragliding mishap, safe and back home. The camaraderie between Captain Ri and his comrades as well as that between Se-ri and her North Korean friends is stirring.Side note: since it was my first kdrama, I wasn't aware that men could be as clear-skinned as women and thought that some camera trick was done to make Hyun Bin's skin so smooth-looking.",9
East Asia,There Is no contest with each others. That' s the best drama ever produced. The golden globe award should be given to the protagonists Kim HyunBin e Son Ye-Jin!,10
East Asia,"I might be the only one who found this show overrated. It is excessively long with too many unnecessary scenes and too much padding. The portrayal of North Korean people helping someone like Se-ri and being a mix of corrupt, unsophisticated, or peasant types is laughable. This show is the Disney-fication of North Korea, which, in reality, is a cruel, merciless regime. The storyline is utterly ridiculous.",2
East Asia,"I've just recently got into watching kdramas. Needless to say, I'm obsessed. This one is so good. Such a good story, very funny, and just the right amount of romcom without being cringey.",10
East Asia,This drama went so deep into feelings that it made a heaven for the audience. If you are here to see if you need to watch it. Just rush and go to watch it. You will never regret seeing such a great amazing series. There is not a single thing that is not good about this drama. I always cry after I see the trailer again and again. It's 2 months since I have seen this. I am not able to get this off my mind.The Chemistry between them can't be expressed in words. I have never seen so much caring people for each other. Though there are some villans too in this series and they actually make the drama more exciting and romantic. I commit that you can never forget this series. I was in love with Son Ye Jin myself. So sweet and nice acting. Hyun Bin also played his role perfectly.The more I say is less. I will really miss them. Just go and watch it if you have not seen this.,10
East Asia,"A clever concept that is well executed, It is glossy and professionally made in a way we've come to expect from South Korea's booming entertainment industry.The casting of the two leads is inspired. Hyun Bin is charismatically handsome playing the North Korean captain with almost superhero powers (although comes across as much less sensually attractive after his South Korean makeover). There are parallels with the sort of appeal that Cary Grant had at his peak. An excellent performance that is so subtle that he can make your tears well up with just the slightest change in facial expression. He is matched with the brilliant Son Ye-jin, whose character has more variation as the story progresses, giving her more to get her acting teeth into. The captain's loyal crew provide much of the comedy (which fits into the overall mood of the piece, and never descends into cartoonlike behavior) and are well performed supporting roles, as is the main villain of the piece.The series is not without its faults however, One or two of the older actors needed to have been held back. They give performances more suited for the stage than the intimacy of a television screen. These stood out against the subtle and believable acting of the leads. The director has to be faulted for allowing these to mar the otherwise excellent production.And there were a number of grammatical errors in the shooting and editing which were disorienting. It's OK to break these rules so long as you do so knowingly, aware of the effect of doing so. They mostly felt like sloppy mistakes. Again the director needs to own these, Two stars were lost for these flaws.And lets face the fact that it did not need to be as long as it is. The endless replaying of scenes, and repetitive flashbacks all felt like padding, as though the production company was being paid by the second of airtime.Despite these complaints, I was completely sucked in, wanting, wanting for the two leads to admit what we could all see, tears running down my face when they started to acknowledge each other's feelings. Often laughing out loud. Forcing myself not to binge, rationing to one episode at a time (except for the last two, which turned out to be the weakest).If you can cope with a long very soapy action love story, with compellingly beautiful leads, set in the two Koreas, go for it. You'll have a ball (and a bawl).",8
East Asia,"1st part was enjoyable. It was nice though there's no way she'd land in North Korea like that. The 2nd part was cringe af. It got too repetitive. A million times of ""it was my fault"", ""no it was my fault not yours"", ""you're getting hurt because of me"", ""I will protect her with my life"". I got so bored of hearing the same sentences over and over again and the lead guy's countless 'poems'. I enjoyed the 4 friends tho the whole time. It also didn't really have a storyline. It's very basic, cringe and clingy.",6
East Asia,"After completing this it was just okay, it started out really good and interesting but like most KD dragged on to much still this introduced maybe a new Korean actress that could be a star",7
East Asia,"EDITED REVIEW-
I wrote my earlier review after watching the second episode, and am editing now after watching the last episode.
I am in tears and the joy I am feeling right now is heart warming. This drama was so beautiful and fabulous... I have no words.
The story line is so good, you will be in tears and you will think again about K dramas, its that beautiful. Every character development is smooth, and its not complete 360 change which usually is shown. Its just becoming better. The costumes, music, scenes, dialogues, actors, editing, production... everything is so perfect I-... Its just awesome.
This show didn't disappoint me even for single second. The last episode is so beautifully, you will be crying that it ended and be happy about the ending the characters got.
And Boy did the actors act?! Kim Soo Hyun is famous I get it, but Oh Jung Se?!! Major shout out to him and Yoo Sae Ji!! these two acted so good that I got moved for real. I have seen Oh Jung Se acting as support actor in so many dramas, but this? This is how a good actor makes a supporting character into a Lead character. Its brilliant. New respect for both Oh Jung Se and Yoo Sae Ji.
This show is a must for everyone who thinks they are 'Not Okay'. This show will show you that being 'Not Okay' is 'okay'. You can have flaws too, and you will see that everyone has them too. You will see that being not okay is what makes you human.OLD REVIEW-
I have watched many k dramas, and this is very different.
Maybe because it's a Netflix original, but it has the touch of more than just k-drama. Whole production idea is different, including the story book display. Great concept. It's not the flowery, lovey dovey k drama fairy tale. It's a dark fairy tale. So i would recommend it for anyone, who likes k drama's concept of childhood friends meeting again and dark deep dialogues. To say it's playlist is good, would be an understatement. Just two episodes and I am already in love with it.",10
East Asia,"I Just Say That This Is BlockBuster Drama I Ever Watch
Seo Ye Ji Just killed it and kim soo hyun performed very well
this very very interesting do watch and
plzz RATE THIS 10 STARS
Plzz Watch U Will Never Disappointed
RATE THIS 10 STARS",10
East Asia,Very interesting and charming Tim Burton-esque opening sequence. I looked it up to see who designed it and sadly there are no credits listed toward the artists. Not sure why this is but maybe someone can get on that.,9
East Asia,"A very well made drama. Interesting storyline, cast, strong female lead, and great cinematography. It has deep meaning behind the plots. As long as you get over the 1 episode, which to me was kinda boring, you'll get hooked!",10
East Asia,"Best k drama
Wouldn't change a thing about my review .",10
East Asia,"This drama is perfecto, the main characters, the story, the ost and the chemestry is on point.",10
East Asia,"I wanted to like this show because the premise is very unusual. A young man (Kim Soo-Hyun playing Moon Gang-Tae) is the sole caregiver to his mentally and emotionally impaired older brother (played by Jeong-se Oh as Moon Sang-Tae).
Gang-Tae also works as a caregiver in a succession of mental health care facilities. The brothers constantly move from place to place as a result of Sang-Tae 'acting out', often in the form of panicked episodes based on his fear of butterflies.A famous writer of dark, twisted fairy tales (Seo Ye-ji as Go Moon Young) is worshipped by Sang-Tae for her stories and illustrations. Inevitably, Gang-Tae crosses paths with Moon Young, not realizing he knew her when they were both very young where he was severely traumatized by her behavior. As adults, Moon Young now relentlessly pursues Gang-Tae and the storyline goes from there.I'm four episodes in and I can see why this K-drama was not very well-received when it initially ran in South Korea. The character of Moon Young is written as an extremely annoying, privileged, prima donna who has childhood secrets and traumas of her own. However, it's hard to care because she's been written as such an exasperating person with a spoiled, cruel attitude and actions to match. I'm finding her tediously painful to watch. Sadly, this leaves the role of Gang-Tae reduced to a series of blank stares, speechless moments and zero emotional range. The secondary roles of a male and female friend to the brothers are relegated to sounding boards and only used as filler to round out the story.I'll try to finish ""It's Okay to not be Okay"", but I can't commit to it. The pacing is off, and the writing (in my view) borders on being unsympathetic to the world of mental illness. That being said, I've yet to find one character or storyline interesting enough to warrant watching the show through to its conclusion.",5
East Asia,I just finished four episodes of this show and all i can say is WOW! This one is a MUST watch even if your not into korean tv shows you still have to watch this one. It's truly moving. The acting is simply amazing and the issues are real and I feel so many people can relate to the issues because in life everyone goes through alot of downs and this show truly covers peoples dark areas inside themselves they want to hide. Its a stunning show please watch if you haven't yet!,10
East Asia,"The writers did a marvelous job with the storyline, and to have S.Korea's top actors n actress portray these characters makes it even more beautiful.. I have to say I've watch Oh Jung-Se- ( who is the brother) act in a lot of other shows, but this series , Oh- I hope you win best supporting actor award, your acting role in this series, is so different from your other roles and you mastered it! Bow down to you Oh Jung-Se..
And of course the main lead actor- the BEAUTIFUL and TALANTED: Kim Soo-Hyun
I gotta say for someone who hasn't done a new series or movies in awhile came out strong with his acting, but of course that's why he's the top korean actors in S.Korea.. Watching him ""work"" this character in details, you can see he has his entire heart/mind in this for the next 16 episode, the connection between him and his brother (oh Jung-Se) melts my heart, the sadness in his eyes, the love, the laughter, we can see it through his acting.. so far just 4 episodes, and I see awards coming their way! Great work, just beautiful!",10
East Asia,"Let me say that the writers did a marvelous Job! On top of that the best of the best S. Korean actors portraying these characters and doing it brilliantly is great!
Oh Jung Se, you are going to win best supporting actor again! I've seen other dramas he's in and this one is something different for him, ??.. and he's doing it very well!
And to the main lead: The BEAUTIFUL n TALANTED: Kim Soo-Hyun, watching each episode you can feel his sadness, his love, the caring, he has for his brother (Oh Jung-Se) the character his portraying he nailed it!
Ye-Ji Seo, great character for you! Love it!
Worth to watch, if you like mysteries, and dark drama..",10
East Asia,"If you haven't watch this, you better start watching it. It's not just a typical RomCom and a little bit of Dark side Korean Drama, but it also talks about Mental Health Issues which is timely relevant and everyone should be educated with",10
East Asia,"After watching many dramas, this is by far the best I have seen so far. This is why...
Every scene is beautiful in it's own way. I felt an emotional connection to all of the characters and have become invested in the story.
It brings the topic of mental health to the fore front so is very current.
The chemistry portrayed between the two lead actors is heart stopping......just kiss already!! ??",10
East Asia,An absolute must watch kdrama of all time!!!! This has been upgrading Kdramas to another level of amazingness. You should experience it yourself and I'll bet that you will not regret or feel like youre wasting your time for this. This is a masterpiece.,10
East Asia,"I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS DRAMA. THE ACTORS, THE CONTENT, THE DIRECTOR..... THE WHOLE TEAM HAVE DEFINITELY CONTRIBUTED OUTSTANDING EFFORT INTO CREATING THIS AMAZING SERIES. IT TEACHES US ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF FAMILY IN OUR LIVES AND THAT SYMPATHY IS ALWAYS AN IMMORTAL MEDICINE FOR A BROKEN HEART AND A VULNERABLE SOUL. A TOTAL MUST WATCH!!",10
East Asia,"From watching this show, people get a chance to learn about their true-self !",10
East Asia,"Even though this show just recently started streaming, it already got me hooked on its first four episodes. I can say that this is not your typical romantic comedy tv show because the story line doesn't just focus on that alone. It also promotes mental health awareness, which I think, is not always seen on tv shows. It shows that there are different kinds of mental illnesses and how each one should be given of importance and should not be neglected. Anyway, its a tv show that is worth watching and looking forward to the next episodes.",10
East Asia,It's only been 4 episodes but it's the BEST K-Drama I've EVER watched. I'm confident they can keep up the energy! LOVE THE PAIRING!!!!,10
East Asia,I fall in love with this drama ?? the best drama in 2020,10
East Asia,This drama is very different from your typical kdrama. It addresses the sensitive topic of mental health and it has me completely hooked after watching only the first few episodes. The actors have great chemistry; their charisma is insane. I really enjoyed the animations that were incorporated into the film. I highly recommend everyone to try experiencing this great drama for themselves because it will surely not disappoint.,10
East Asia,This drama raised sensitive issues in which you can identify yourself . I just love how it's not only a drama but a healing process.,10
East Asia,"Best actor and actress , good chemistry both of them",10
East Asia,"Just finished episode 4 and am blown away, everything about it is spot on. Can't take my eyes off Go Moon Young who is made even better by the male lead who never changes expression, he is totally wooden throughout which just makes her that much more spell binding. Looking forward to more episodes.",10
East Asia,"THIS IS A HEALING SHOWThere are definitely some things I've learned from it.~ Accept your reality
~ Remember your pain and overcome it
~ Love yourself first before loving others",10
East Asia,Creativity at its finest. Highly recommended. This drama will open your eyes to what's going on around the world right now.,10
East Asia,"Love the drama. A must see. The cast, the acting, the cinematography, the animation literally everything is so good.",10
East Asia,"Actually I am not a fan of either the main actor or actress. I am a typical person who chooses to watch a drama because of the cast, while watching this drama my desire is actually just to fill my free time, not to wait for the comeback of the actor or actress. It could be called just an accident, but dang! even from the first episode I was very much in love with this drama, the main actors were equally very strong, their wives were very good, the storyline was not common and boring, it tells about someone's mental state, they have a good moral message. To be honest, since I became acquainted with the world of Korean drama, this drama has been included in the best drama of all time, in my own opinion. Look at this drama, I guarantee you will not be disappointed",10
East Asia,"This k-drama feels different and I love different! I'm astounded with the animation, cinematography, writing, and acting. I smell Baeksang Arts Awards.",10
East Asia,"This drama is just perfect, u can't find one better!",10
East Asia,"I will keep it simple and short.The story tells about the girl who needs help in her life so that she can push through her life.She was devasted inside because of her mother being dead and her father who disliked her very much,who even tried to strangle her two times.When she gets to see gang tae she really wanted him to be partner but the obstacles that comes at both their life must need to be faced. Gang tae has to take of his brother meanwhile mrs.ko has to lift her company up once again and wants gang tae by her side. She is evil outside but angel inside.",9
East Asia,The English OSTs in the drama are so good. Makes the drama even more unique. The adaptation of the fairytales are done so nicely. And Seo YeJi did a marvelous job. She made ne almost tear up many times,9
East Asia,"I don't know how i can explain it, but this is best Korean drama ever. You know that story line, story idea is so interesting and anti mainstream. In every episode we get sad, happy, scared, curious, cuteness and many more. The actor and actress also so good. Oh god wish Saturday came so fast. Okey bye, i hope this drama also the actor get achievements",10
East Asia,It's not a typical love story. I can't wait for the next episodes!,10
East Asia,It just got you hooked from the first episode. the aesthetic this drama have was just *chefs kiss. i really tortured myself by watching this while it's still ongoing. but i could already said that it's a must watch !!,10
East Asia,"This is such a great show!! It got me obsessed within the first two episodes. The main characters are both so good at portraying their emotions! I LOVE that the character of the main actress is so different to other main characters to diverse K-Dramas. Ok so let me explain. In most Dramas its always this quirky, shy, innocent girl that has no idea about life or whatever and that always needs the help of a man to achieve something. In its okay to not be okay though, the female character is strong and independent. She has more like this personality where she knows from the beginning what she wants and tries to get it by whatever means. And can we just take a minute and appreciate how visually pleasing the main actors are like omg they are GOREGOUS !!!",10
East Asia,It's one of the best K series of 2020; Wonderful production with a brilliant script and dialogues; Very different drama with a great concept. Acting is the best I have seen in K dramas and with a very strong female lead.,10
East Asia,"Wonderful production with a brilliant script and dialogues; Very different drama with a great fairy tale concept and perfect performance by the leads - great cinematography. Acting is the best I have seen in K dramas recently with a very strong female lead and with many amazing tension and romantic sciences, most are done with face expression only.",10
East Asia,The best kdrama I have ever watched .. I highly recommend this drama.. you won't be dissapointed ..,10
East Asia,Loved everything about. Loved the acting. Loved the storytelling. Loved the chemistry between the whole cast. Am hooked!!!!!!!!,10
East Asia,The plot and storyline is lovely. Seo Ye Ji is a superb choice for Go mo young character. Feel happy to watch whenever Seo Ye Ji and Kim so hyun are together in a scene. The acting skill of San Htal brother is mind blowing. Hope to get much more success and awards in the upcoming years.,8
East Asia,"Not your typical kdrama, it's really different and the chemistry between the characters is amazing. I love everything about it and highly recommend it.",10
East Asia,"Excellent performance by Kim Soo Hyun and Seo Ye Ji.
Perfectly matching couple.

East Asia,"It's different from the kdramas you will see. It's artistic, it's magical. It's so beautifully portrayed. Every scene is so emotional. I think it's one of the best I've ever seen.",10
East Asia,"This tv show does not generalize, sensationalize or glorify mental health issues. They show that every person despite their appearance may have something they're working through. The main characters have insane chemistry (brother to brother, friend to friend, lover to lover) which makes the story even more believable and the scenes more enjoyable. I have never seen a tv show like this before and I absolutely love it!",10
East Asia,For almost 10 years of watching kdrama this one is my top on my bucket list.amazing,10
East Asia,"I agree that once you passed the first episode, you will be hooked and you can't wait for the next episode. You will never get tired of watching it over and over again... while i am waiting for the next episode, i watch the old episode again, can you imagine that. I like the acting, very spontenoues , very natural, i like the chemistry of the 2 main characters. They are all good delivering their roles though. very real. Not lousy or overacting. They delivers. The story is not boring and one of a kind. The story and characters are all unique. This will be my one of the best ever kdrama. I will be very sad if this will be missed out by everyone.",10
East Asia,"Ethereal and mischievous, the show is truly a work of beauty as it contrives to thrust its viewers into a world surrealism. It's Okay not to be Okay (IONTBO) manages to weave the fairy tale stories of Ko Moon Young (SYJ) into the central plot of the show. Each of the fairy tale story is reflected on each episode. Albeit whimsically portrayed through stop motion animation and silent film production, the fairy tale stories speak of volumes as it mirror the real lives of the characters of the show.I would also like to commend the chemistry of all the actors involved on the show ---especially the leads, Kim Soo Hyun and Seo Yi Ji. Their on-screen partnership blossoms as they perfectly embody their characters on the show.",10
East Asia,"Absolutely LOVING this drama. Everything from the writing to directing and actors/acting, Just amazing. By the way just found out it ranked No. 6 in Neflix world TV drama Jul13. Hope more people can watch this drama. Best KDrama so far this year.",10

East Asia,"Not your ordinary romcom korean drama, it's really amazing how they tackle and discuss this kind of issue. Because nowadays its becoming more and more stigma being emotionally unstable. In this novela they delicately discuss every issue and concerns of persons with disability. The acting of actors both Soo Hyun Ssi and Yea Ji are highly appreciated as well as Se Oh Oppa. Every episode is to die for and every episode exceeds your expectations.",10
East Asia,"Best chemistry I have ever seen in a Kdrama. They're so good that I don't think there is out there who can match their chemistry. For me, they should be proclaimed as the PRINCE AND PRINCESS of Kdrama. This drama and leads will go down as one of the best. Broke the ITAEWON CLASS & THE KING ETERNAL MONARCH record and now holds the highest rank in the global ranking as (6th) WORLDWIDE!!! They also dominate as Top 1 in 8 countries and making a wave in western countries!!! (c)MelaParkALL IN JUST 8 EPISODES!!!!",10

East Asia,"It's really awesome. Different from the normal trend, Best Korean drama ever",10
East Asia,"It has been a while since I have not watched a spectacular korean drama. I think the last drama that hook me is The World of The Married. But it is different genre. As k drama fans know, kdrama recently introduce many types psychology and mental illness drama but mostly the drama only focus about their love story and the script seems off sometimes until it becomes so typical like any other kdrama. But unlike this drama.. every phrases, scripts all hook me up. The animation, direction, well written, and well acted as well.",10
East Asia,Well written drama.. creative direction and excellent acting!! plus visually stunning actors.. chemistry between the leads is intense.. favourite drama this year so far...,10

East Asia,"This series is great

East Asia,"I have watched ahead of many k dramas in my entire life, and a lot of unique plot of the story and i've encountered a lot of lessons too. However, this fresh k drama gives me chill and goosebumps because of it's flawless storyline and ofcourse it's cinematography whereas the whole cast is very great with their acting skills. This is the only korean drama that has a different plot story regarding about our reality, the whole production idea is very quite impressive and it's not only about the flow of the story but also the lessons you'll get to know here in the drama. This is the new whole package korean drama of 2020 that you'll never forget.I know that we haven't complete to watch 16 episodes yet, but we already knew from the start that this drama is something. My experience towards watching this drama is that unexplainable or i couldn't just explain it through words but i'll try to express its feeling towards watching this. First of all this drama has an interesting storyline and i can say that the main cast has the chemistry because of its uncommon similarities. My experience of this is that, i was hooked when i first heard that it is one of the ""Upcoming drama of 2020"" and then when i read the whole story it gives me goosebumps because of its interesting storyline and ofcouse we all agree that we also want to watch this drama because of ""Kim Soo Hyun"" But actually it doesn't matter because this drama got me hooked. It makes me feel overwhelming every episodes that i've had watch gives me a lot of lessons, i mean every episodes will give you a lot of lessons in life if you're actually sad, bored, broken hearted or any other feelings you have in life it doesn't matter when you start to watch this drama. It also makes me smile like an idiot ofcourse like what i've said it has the most interesting beautiful storyline among the best kdramas that you already watched. As soon as you've start to watch this drama you'll never get bored or tired of watching this endlessly. This is the first korean drama that made me express my feelings through writing a review and also it mades me express my feelings that i've been holding inside for my entire life at last i've no longer to hold any pains inside because i've learned something from this drama. I thank the whole production for releasing this drama, i bet that a lot of people will love this wholeheartedly as well as i do. I am a leukemia patient, trying to live peaceful life while recovering and i found this drama that gaves me a lot of courage and hope. For many people out there if you found yourself needing a help and then this drama will provide everything for you especially the awaiting lessons! And one thing for sure i'm a die hard fan of Kim Soo Hyun! A lot of love coming from philippines! I love the whole cast and production, keep up the goodwork!",10
East Asia,"Truly a masterpiece, with wonderfull music, talented actors and a breathtaking storyline. The director of the psychiatric ward Ok said: It's just like when You fart. If You hold it in 99 times and finally let it out, it could kill people. (in ep9)",10
East Asia,"The best kdrama , I wouldn't change my mind about it.
I like their acting ; they are varrrry talent .
I like kim soo hyun alot ; he is one of the best korean acters .",10
East Asia,"I watched around 200+ korean dramas and i'm so amazed by this drama. Excellent cinematography, editing, animation, directing, writing and most of all acting! The performances of the actors are one of the bests i've seen in a kdrama. Kim Soo Hyun, deserves to be the highest paid actor in south korea with many acting awards for the past 10 years of his career! (baeksang best actor and 4 Daesang awards)",10
East Asia,"It's Okay to Not Be OkayIf you haven't started watching this series which is trending top 10 on Netflix, then please start watching and trust me you will fall in love with this unusual love story.I am finished with 10th episode of this series and I liked Everything thing about this series, it's story line, characters and actors playing those character fit perfectly to the characters, Aesthetic, cinematography and character development of every character with every episode, supporting actors are like cherry on the cake.Writer (Jo young) and director (Park shin woo) who is also directed Encounter another one of my favourite series.I feel director Park shin woo really have nack of portraying unusual love stories.As I said Every things about this series is so good that it will keep you hooked and with an excitement what will happen next.As the title says that it's okay to be not okay, which is well justified with the story line. There is one important character Moon Sang tae (Oh jung se) and one of my favourite who is an autistic person.Moon Sang tae cannot well understand human emotions but have memorized these emotions looking at different human emotions which he always sticks to his wall and remembers it and also never fails to show what he feels inside. Moon Gang- tae who is younger brother of Moon Sang-tae (Kim soo Hyun) and Ko Mun -yeong ( Seo ye-ji) children's book author. They being normal' human being suppress their true emotions deep inside their heart and keep a different face to the show the World.
It's not only the love story between two doesn't make this series exciting to watch but a different human psychology depicted through Ko Mun -yeong ' s children's book and titled episodes with the same.This depiction psychology and different perception is something where we are able to connect ourselves in our life and can understand others too.I especially liked the ko mun Yeong character which is not normal korean heroine character like cute and innocent (that place is taken in this series by Moon Sang tae.)This character is being shown as a real witch with breathtakingly beauty and fashion and it's not just because she is a lead she has to be in good fashion, there is a reason why is this character being shown as over dressed or high on fashion which you will find out once you watch.Moon Gang tae is a character with lot of patience who works as care taker in mental Asylum and whose whole life is been spend taking care of his brother Moon Sang tae
Being the only one to take care of his autistic brother and sacrificed entire life for him is craving for little care and love for himself.There are supporting characters who fills gaps and also make you laugh hilariously , especially jo jae-soo (kang ki dong ) who has really good comic timing , I have seen him other series as well, and his work in comic timing is just awesome and yoo seung jae (Park jin -joo) as well is very funny and cute.This series is just not the roller coaster of different human emotions but also the added suspense from the beginning where you could not to stop in between instead you will keep waiting for the next episode to release",9

East Asia,I can relate to this show. I so love this drama :-) congrats KSH,10
East Asia,"An absolute gem. I've never seen Seo Ye-Ji before, and i'm still mesmerized by how deep and sexy her voice is.",10
East Asia,"I can't begin to explain my obsession for this drama. From the cinematography, unique scene transitions, animation to the sound effects is all done so well. It's not just a romance, it's so much more. The title speaks for itself, it's a story about healing but we have to keep in mind no one is perfect or will ever be and it's okay. It's okay to not fit into the ""norm"" that society has etched into us. It's about understanding and accepting. It's everything! It's not heavy but it's not light on the emotions either. It's the perfect balance. You will find yourself laughing so much then the next you find yourself in tears. I am fully invested in the imperfectly-perfect characters.",10
East Asia,"This is the best drama in 2020, and maybe one of the best of all time. PERFECT",10
East Asia,"I don't wanna this drama to end, but I'm curious about the ending. This drama is really amazing. They're great actors, really!!",10
East Asia,"You guys must watch this drama, this one really out of the box, how they talk about mental illness is no joke. How the team of this drama production do their best in this drama, the cast, the lines, cinematography and the whole ost of this drama is really great! Let's watch and support it more and more guys!.",10
East Asia,"The story is like an onion- it has many layers. Each layer reveals a mystery. It also took on a heavy subject such as autism and managed to cover it in a realistic manner. As I watch the show I feel the struggle for the caregiver and at the same time begin to understand and appreciate the uniqueness of the person with autism. This is brought about with good storytelling and great actors.The story is also about people who have been hurt and they are not doing okay. Just like the title, ""It's okay to NOT be okay."" , it helps the audience appreciate each character with their flaws and their struggles to the point of being endearing.It takes a while for the story to build up and it gets more intriguing as each episodes progresses.Unlike the typical K-drama, the characters are not immediately likeable and thus if one is expecting that- they may be disappointed. However, this show is worth watching because as the onion is being peeled off- we learn to love ourselves and others a little bit more. Also, we get to see the world with different perspectives, 'broadening' our hearts",10
East Asia,"It took me a few episodes to be gripped but now I am obsessed and have watched them all again. Stunning acting - all of them, especially Kim Soo Hyun and Oh Jung Se. Such difficult roles and they are completely convincing. The reconciliation scene between the brothers was so touching.",10
East Asia,I love this drama! It's probably going to me my number 1 kdrama!,10
East Asia,"This is the best drama I have seen this year, very touch, be sure tissue ready before you watch, it makes you laugh and cry",10
East Asia,"Very so much the best of this ""its ok to not be okay"". If you don't watch, you will regret it, because there is a lesson from the contents of the story in it. I like it, sarangheo...",10
East Asia,Truly a very valuable treat that is awaited every weekend by fans of Kim Soo Hyun and Seo Ye Ji around the world.,10
East Asia,"Almost every interview the cast mentions or describes it as healing drama. As I reached the 9th episode, I can get why they claimed it.",10
East Asia,"This is the show that everyone might relate to. Some topics are quite sensitive and hits a spot to anyone watching. This is a proof that anyone might be struggling too. So if you're someone struggling too this might be the kind of show to make you feel better and light hearted.
This is not like any other kdrama. The actors are very convincing and gave great justice to the roles they're portraying. I can't imagine any other actor/actress doing this. I like the on-screen and off-screen chemistry of the lead actors. I commend the writer and director for pulling off this great show.",10
East Asia,The most PERFECT drama ever. You must seen from ep 1... the visual is no kidding and also ost totally suitable with every episode,10
East Asia,"Watching this drama is like riding a rollercoaster. Love everything in this drama. Actors, storyline, script, cinematography, etc. Best of this year.",10
East Asia,"All about this drama is absolutely incredible. The storyline, visuals, actors and even the soundtracks",10
East Asia,"Easiest 10 rating of my life. It's really hard to do romance movies or series that actually bring anything new to the table and feel distinguished and intimate. This series deals with the real harsh nature of life that most media choose to mellow while carefully easing you in. I haven't watched a romance series in a while and this one is what I would describe as perfection. If you are someone who reflects one's self on the lead characters, whether you are a man or woman, you'll definitely enjoy this couple's relationship. I know I do.",10
East Asia,"Have watched a lot of Korean Dramas since Prince Hours/Goong and I can say this is not only one of the best but THE BEST drama I've watched. Not your typical romance drama. This also about brotherhood, friendship and makes you face your own mental health. Repeated multiple times each episodes and never get tired of it. It makes you feel a Rollercoaster ride of emotions, it definitely gets to your heart. Storyline, cinematography, the actors, OST and Tim Burton like animation is PERFECTLY GOOD. This drama is one of the best things that happen this year.",10
East Asia,"You must watch it! Dark fairy tale mixed with slice of life, romance, and comedy in this drama is epic. You'll find that this drama is not like others. The actors and actress really impressive. They're so good at playing their role. They are also good looking. Worth it!!! I really love this drama, ^^",10
East Asia,"/best series
best actors
best acting
best story
best visuals
best screenplay
best cinematography/ all are perfect in this series ,highly recommended series of 2020.
""Best kdrama of 2020""",10
East Asia,Best kdrama series of 2020 and lead actress seo ye ji outstanding and standout of the drama and all cast are doing wonderful job!!,10
East Asia,"This is probably a fruitless effort to actually describe how great this drama is, since I absolutely cannot express it in words. However, I want to elucidate that the way mental illness along with the romance and thrill are connected and interwined together has won over my heart. Not to mention that Seo Ye-ji is such a beauty, it's literally a treat to watch her. I love her and I never thought I'd be such a die-hard fan of this woman.",10
East Asia,"It's an Asian hit. However, I personally disliked the drama for its limitless pity. Psychos are one-sided victims. The main character works in a mental hospital. He looks like Cinderella. Already in the first episode, the man was showered with misfortunes - he was beaten, humiliated, fired, kicked out of school by his autistic brother, he was cut with a knife, someone vomited on him ... And this is only in the first episode. To finish off the viewer, we were shown a beautiful, scarred body clearly hinting at the sufferer's difficult past. The main character is a storyteller, she is also sick and suffering. Like all psychos in this drama, her parents are to blame for her problems. All in turn cry, scream, suffer and sting each other.",4
East Asia,"Making a drama or a movie on Mental Illness concept is very complicated and should execute it with very accurate information simultaneously show it to the audiences in a very understandable way.
I think It's Okay To Be Not Okay Kdrama has done a great job by showcasing various mental illnesses and how to cope up with it in a very unique way.
On the whole -
Best Story
Best Cinematography
Best Direction
Best Couple - OMG KSH and SYJ....I Love U guys !! Why don't you guys get married ?!
And Brilliant Acting by all the CastESP. KIM SOO HYUN ! Your Acting Skills are god gifted",10
East Asia,"Interesting story, cast and great cinematography, plots and the chemistry of the lead actor
A great night food for everyone
I have watched many K-drama before, but this is the best.I felt an emotional connection to all the characters and have become invested in the story. It bring for me the topic of mental health to the fore front so it very current",10
East Asia,"Probably one of the best kdrama I've ever watch. The storyline totally unique and deep meaning, the screenwriter and main writer are my favorite from now on. Beautiful from every aspect-- every angle, I can't find any faulty even its already half episodes. Appreciate for all the team!",10
East Asia,"I like the story, the characters of the tv drama was really awesome.. Moon Yeung, Gang Tae and Sang Tae, kudos to them",10
East Asia,"Here's a warning for you! Don't start watching the show before August 9, because you'll be forlorn once Episode 10 finishes, which will make you wait week after week for two new episodes every Saturday and Sunday, and that my dearest, is a wait you don't want to undertake. It's a rollercoaster of a story with sparking chemistry between the lead characters, typical can't live with or without cat-mouse chase. I am tired of childhood friends meet again storylines in K-dramas, but here, they know it at the outset, who they are, no surprises there. It's the sheer fact that they know exactly who they are, that they want to avoid each other, yet can't stay apart. Immensely creative storyline, set against the backdrop of mental illness, a much neglected topic. Regular people walking and talking around a psychiatric hospital, goes to show, mental illness of various kinds, which may not always be visible on the surface. Splendid performance from all actors attached to the storylines of the main characters. It's quickly becoming my all-time favourite K-drama - why? Because it knocks at all the corners of your brain and heart with well thought-out dialogues and screenplay. Must watch!!",10
East Asia,"This series is excellent, you should give it a shot. From the story, to actors and even the cinematography I'm not gonna lie, it's ?? percent perfect!",10
East Asia,"I dont know how to express, but im in love with thiss drama, the cast, the story, the background, I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS KDRAMA. THANKYOU FOR CHOOSE SOOHYUN AND YEJI FOR THE LEAD. THEY HAVE BEST CHEMISTRY TOGETHER. Not just they, but act all the cast is really out of the box, i mean ITS AMAZING DUDE. OH MY GOD. i love ITS OKAY NOT TO BE OKAY, HUUU I WISH SOOHYUN AND YEJI HAVE DRAMA TOGETHER AFTER THIS. THANKYOU FOR MAKING THIS AMAZING KDRAMA.",10
East Asia,Literally the BEST Kdrama of the year. I literally sit every weekend refreshing Netflix waiting for new episodes to be released. I do not have enough words to praise this show!!,10
East Asia,"It's a heart-melting kdrama. After a few episodes, it made me wonder what a man could endure before he broke down. How much sadness does a man hide behind high walls?",10
East Asia,"Even though I'm currently watching until Episode 11th, it's good enough to tell that this shows can make you experience all of the emotions that you can expect from a great show. The cast deliver each of their role on point. The 2 main leads, Moon Young and Gang-tae show us how 2 people who need love and can possibly find love, passionately and wholeheartedly. The brother, Sang-tae, is portrayed as accurately as one good actor can, who has autism and is not willing to lose his only family member but trying to learn to let someone in their closed circle. Must watch!!! You will cry.",10
East Asia,"Amazing casts, brilliant story line, and incredible crew",10
East Asia,"This is the kind of drama we all need!!! After watching so many amazing dramas, this is a drama that makes me feel like my soul is LITERALLY getting healed. Each scene was so impactful and the whole drama was packed with so many different emotions. The way they could keep it light but still suspenseful is just... i have no words. I just love it.
I especially loved the scene where it was showing the female lead letting go of a rock that was in her hand. It showed how having just one person on your side, who loves and protect you, can help you become a better person. It was a breathtaking moment for me, I HAD GOOSEBUMPS!!! It was amazing how it was just a 1 sec shot.
P.s.
I have a question,
this is a drama that is trending worldwide but isn't doing so well in Korea. Why? I'm really curious.",10
East Asia,The female lead is probably one of the best characters that I've ever come across in kdramas... She's such a badass queen that you start loving her more as the series progresses. The acting is extremely amazing.The drama handles so many mental and emotional issues beautifully. The personal traumatic experiences of each of the characters helps shape their personality. The drama has some amazing cinematography with such aesthetic visuals that it's hard to take your eyes off of the screen. I'd watch this drama again and again just for the experience.,10
East Asia,"The story line, the actors, the raw emotions, pure but selfish love of each character, OSTs, iconic lines, mysteries and of course the romance that the world needs to see and experience as we face the pandemic. These drama will surely captivate our innermost desires and ambitions along with emotional and mental health care... To make it short, Its the best and keeps getting better as we approach the end",10
East Asia,Since the first episode came out I knew that I will love watching this kdrama.I can wait for the next episode...,10
East Asia,It's loaded with chemistry between the two leads. The visuals are another reason which makes this drama a must watch. The music in this drama are so beautiful and heartfelt.,10
East Asia,Love this drama a lot!! Every saturday and sunday can't wait to watch it!! Good job to the teams!!!,10
East Asia,"English is not my first language but I'm trying to put into words the amazing kdrama this is, it made me feel a lot of emotions and empathize with the characters, it's the best kdrama i've watched this 2020, Netflix did great with this, i'm grateful i started watching IOTNBO, the ost, the actors, storyline, everything's perfect.",10
East Asia,"I hope this will have Season 2, 3, 4 until 100! ?? I super loved this Kdrama! ? Complete package and amazing actors specially SEO YEJI and KSH. Best Couple! Chemistry is on fireeee!! ?? I love youuuuu ate Seo Yea-Ji. ??from ????",10
East Asia,"This is the first time I ever felt compelled to write a review about a drama. I am not very good with words, but I am obsessed with this drama and so invested in both the main and side characters. Beautiful cinematography, script and the acting... WOW! The chemistry between Kim SooHyun vs Seo Yeji vs Oh JungSe is beyond anything I've seen on any Kdramas. KSH & SYJ are beautiful and are just mesmerising to watch. It is refreshing how each episode is a life lesson and has an underlying fairy tale theme which is inter-wovened into the plot and the character's development. Each ep gets better and better. Counting days when the weekend would come, so I can strap myself and engross in the show. This show will make you laugh and cry, laugh cry within minutes. Thank you production team for this drama and for casting such stellar casts. It is truly a healing drama for me.",10
East Asia,"It is such a beautiful show that deals with real issues and portrays real people, the storyline is superb and the director did a phenomenal job. I would 100% recommend this drama to anyone wether you usually watch kdramas or not. The actors did a wonderful job.",10
East Asia,"The drama shared with us that fairy tales are not just about the ""and they live happily ever after"" but it's about pains, emotions, struggles, resentments, and trust that has been vanished and we need to pick up the pieces to find ourselves. Psycho But It's Okay is not just an ordinary Korean drama that you wish to eat popcorn while watching but honestly this drama empowers mental health issues. Another thing is the characters are is trying to give us awareness about the people in our surroundings that are mentally challenged and how can we deal with them. The best Korea drama ever",10
East Asia,It's okay to not be okay is the best drama I've ever seen??,10
East Asia,"It is extremely rare for Kdramas to focus on mental health. In this drama, we see people with PTSD, Antisocial Disorder, Autism etc. AND WE LEARN ABOUT THEM IN A DIFFERENT WAY by looking at their experiences and how the actors portray their lines. It is amazing!!!! This drama is something we need to cherish in history! And I am not exaggerating at all. Also, Seo Yea Ji IS THE PERFECT ACTRESS to play Ko MunYeong! I cannot imagine anyone else playing her role. I am happy that she is getting the recognition SHE DESERVES as lead actress. Seo Yea Ji is so committed to her craft, as I read articles of her past projects about how she prepared for her roles. SHOUT OUT to all the amazing cast!!!! The casting crew did an amazing job putting these amazing actors together!!!",10
East Asia,"It is categorized as a RomCom, but it is more than that. It is a balance of diff. types. One thing it is a 100 percent is it being a healing drama. It provokes you to face the ugly truth we live in, on how we relate to people we consider less or different from us but at the same time give us that sense of hope (if we allow ourselves to be open with it) that we can be better versions of ourselves.",10
East Asia,"This show itself is an apology letter to people who are mentally different from the society we have created thinking they don't understand us but it is exactly the opposite.
This show gives its audience what we expect from a classic yet different drama. The transaction from one scene to another is so smooth that you don't realise the effect as anything dramatic. The emotions of loneliness Sadness Happiness Jealousy Love are so amazingly portrayed that you feel like this is no big deal but will let you understand human nature.
Also how many times have you felt the need to ignore and not be bothered about those mental patients that we have separated from our regular society.
Think.",10
East Asia,This Kdrama ruined me so well that it made do an IMDB review (for the first time since i'm too lazy to do one lol) EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS KDRAMA IS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT,10
East Asia,"The natural chemistry of Seo Ye Ji and Kim Soo Hyun got me so crazy like i mean i can't help but to ship them!!! The casts are all amazing, the story line talks about mental health and how someone should deal with it. The plot of the story got me asking every questions on who's the real culprit. I MEAN HOW CAN I NOT LOVE THIS DRAMA WHEN EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS IS JUST SO PERFECT?!",10
East Asia,We've all been going through tough times and it's hard to explain what you really feel until i came across this korean drama. This series is like a person who i could talk to about my childhood traumas and my mental health. This is more than just a kdrama. This has helped me accept my flaws and the horrible experiences i had. This has helped me accept and respect whatever life has for me and deal with it. I'm still in the process of healing bit I can say I have some progress after watching some of the episodes of this show. This is a blessing for me.,10
East Asia,I definitely recommend this drama for you to watch. No spoilers. ;),10
East Asia,"I'd never thought I'd find the perfect Korean drama, but here I am.. giving 10/10 for this K drama because it really deserves the 10/10 rating. Watching the main leads' acting is a truly enjoyable experience for me. The chemistry between the main leads are out of this world. I can relate to the characters and the stories in this drama.. As someone who has mental health issue, I'm so glad I've found this healing drama.",10
East Asia,I've never been much of a kdrama fan. I've watched a couple through the years usually casually and would even leave some unfinished if i found it boring already. This is the first kdrama that has ever gotten me so hooked its crazy. Tbh it transcends the usual type of kdramas and its def a must watch even for non kdrama fans. Cinematography is stellar. The chemistry of the leads is FIRE. The acting is excellent. When the characters are in pain u also feel like ur in pain as well. And most of all the story is beautiful and relevant. How they intertwine fairy tales with mental health and mental disorders is so touching to me and it even made me reflect on my own mental state. If this drama and its actors/actresses wont get awards I WILL RIOT!!!,10
East Asia,"One of the most well written, unique, brilliant, healing , and deep series i've ever seen
every single scene, dialogue is full of hidden inner meanings, and it's really the Best at symbolism and metaphors.the Character development in IOTNBO the SMOOTHEST and the BEST I've seen in k drama.",10
East Asia,"I love this drama because this give a lesson for everyone.. Kim soo hyun-shhi and seo yea ji-sshi's acting is not joke, oh jung se-sshi also good well.
The point this drama is the best as I see ever, sometime make me sad to happy, suddenly feeling like roller-coaster lol. Umm they look good together and the best chemistry, I love them as the best couple. They are deserve getting a winner this year and getting Oscar.Hyunji forever-Moonmoon forever",10
East Asia,"First of all I love love the main actor Kim Soo Hyun because he is just beautiful!! But he's a great actor since I've seen him on ""The Moon Embracing the Sun"", ""My Love from Another Star."" And seeing him made a cameo on Hotel de Luna and Crash Landon on You, I just couldn't wait for this series!!!
And I must say this one definitely doesn't disappoint at all!!! His chemistry with Seo Ye Ji and Oh Jung Se just phenomenal!!
The story just keep on your seat and keep you wanting more. It fills with all the right elements. Enjoy!!!",10
East Asia,"This drama is a must watch! I am not a kdrama lover so its surprising that I can really enjoy this drama. The storyline is a combination between romcom and disney x tim burton, so it is pretty refreshing to see how each episode has a moral story about mental health that is connected with a fairy tale. Not only that, I give my ultimate applause to the main trio! Their acting is superb. Oh Jung Se really nail his performance as a man with autism. Kim Soo Hyun gives a dashing performance as selfless man who really loves his autistic brother (his visual is beyond words). And Soe Yea Ji can portrays her character really well, I got annoyed and jealous with her at the same time. I get hooked by the end of third episode and literally cant stop watching till the latest episode, and get to wait every weekend to watch it in Netflix. I wish this drama gets the attention it deserves.",10
East Asia,And I didn't even forward 10 sec of any episode and it is my first korean drama,10
East Asia,"This drama has everything I could ask for consisting of romance, drama, and mystery. Two people meet by fate and find emotional comfort within each other, healing themselves of their scars. Seo Yea-Ji perfectly portrays KMY with the combination of her fierce look and deep voice, charming many viewers. Kim Soo-Hyun is also an amazing fit for this role. One quick glance at his eyes, and you'll be drawn into the painful world of MKT. Both had hardships and grudges they've been keeping in, it's just a matter of when they'll fully express it. Each episode has a message behind it and it never fails to keep me wanting more.",10
East Asia,The cinematography is absolutely stunning - each shot is unique and breathtaking. The actors are incredible and you're in love with them episode 1. I have never seen another show let alone kdrama at this level of perfection. It better win an award for best show because I'm absolutely floored at the overall gift of this show. It touches and moves you with so many different emotions- I'm only halfway through the season and I'm just itching for more.,10
East Asia,Loved it. Not those kinds of cringey dramas. A lot of life lessons are told in this drama.,10
East Asia,"This show is amazing and has you hooked from the first minute. The cast is fantastic and has so much chemistry. It's exciting, heartbreaking, thoughtful, and not as cheesy as other Kdrama/Netflix series. Must watch!",10
East Asia,"I just really don't have words to describe what i am feeling of this drama. This is a masterpiece, an emotional roller coaster in which you are feeling emotions that you don't know that existed.
I am speechless and so grateful for this drama ""it's okay to not be okay""",10
East Asia,"I love how this drama is about mental health issues and not a typical romcom drama. After watching this drama I have the courage to face the things that frighten me most and to remember all hurtful memories instead of avoiding them. Thank you IOTNBO! And thank you Kim Soo Hyun, Seo Yea Ji, Oh Jung Se for being superb actors in this drama!This is my favorite quote from The boy who fed on nightmares:
""Remember it all and overcome it. If you don't overcome it, you'll always be a kid whose soul never grows.""",10
East Asia,"I'm not an expert in K-dramas but I've watched a decent number of dramas. ""Psycho But It's Okay"" has to be my favorite. The chemistry between the leads and the brilliant ideas in every episode amazes me every time. and most importantly, they educate the viewers about mental illnesses and it's normal for people to be this way, hence the name of the drama. I totally recommend watching it if you haven't already done.",10
East Asia,"This drama is very well made. Its plot, storyline, casts, everything make it perfect. No wonder it will be hit drama. The casts, especially KSH and SYJ, also OJS really did a great job, their chemistry is no joke. Thankyou for making this drama alive. It s sad that the drama will end soon. I will be waiting for their next project and hope KSH and SYJ will be paired again in the future.",10
East Asia,"Masterpiece is the only word that comes to my mind after watching this series. Amazing screenplay, brilliant story, and perfect actors. Seo Ye-Ji is par excellence. The message conveyed by this show is going to resonate for a long long time!",10
East Asia,"This is only the second k-drama that I am watching.before this drama,I only watched my love from the star which blew my mind and instantly made me fall in love with Kim Soo hyun and k-drama.Then I searched to only find that most of the Korean dramas are like this same genre.so I was searching for something new and when I start watching this drama, I find that it is something new addition to Korean dramas..not that typical rom-coms.its a unique and emotional journey of love and relationship.this realistic portrait of relationship made me fall in love with this drama",10
East Asia,"Literally a masterpiece. There's so much more than the visuals of main character. But the way this drama explain how life works through the fairy tale is just.. so pure. You don't even have to think of anything while watching it, the drama will heal you.",10
East Asia,The 13th episode will surely give u chills. At last we get to know about ko mun yeong's mother.,10
East Asia,It's a human healing drama. I can even learn about mental illness. Moreover every episode covered in a fairy tail that makes me curious what's fairy tail will pop up each on the next episodes. Still can't believe it will be end up soon ?? but ???????????,10
East Asia,Salute to all of you (casts and crews). This story is really a human healing drama.,10
East Asia,The actor who plays the brother with autism is such a wonderful actor. I hope people realize how good he is.,8
East Asia,"This drama is one of the best I have seen. The story is rich and layered. It is very unique. The acting by all three main actors are sublime. I recommend it as well to international viewers, I am a native English speaker and have really loved watching it. It portrays various mental health issues in a sensitive manner and you will become invested in these beautifully written and acted characters from episode 1.",10
East Asia,"Kdramas are not what i usually watch but this one is very worth the watch. The chemistry between Kim so hyun and Seo ji is outta this world. I higly recommend. Even if this genre wouldnt be your ideal thing to watch, I guarantee that you will like !",10
East Asia,Okay at the beginning.Story Started to fall apart since the 4 episode.,1
East Asia,"This drama is a total perfection. From the cast, soundtract, screenplay .... everything.",10
East Asia,"This drama has a brilliant plot, stunning visuals , excellent actors and mind blowing editing. Absolute perfection",10
East Asia,"It's ok not to be ok is a drama which centres around a psychiatric hospital where the sensitive Moon Kang Tae (Ye-ji Soo) works. Moon Kang has an autistic brother Moon Tang Sae(Jeong-se Oh) who is the only witness to their mothers murder. Go moon Young (Ye-ji Soo) a fairytale book author who writes stories on the dark side (think Tim Burton style) She also has a troubled past with the possibility her father who is at the hospital may have murdered her mother. The paths of the main cast have crossed in childhood, and their relationship with each other is troubled. Go moon is a flamboyant extrovert and once she sees something she likes she focuses on it alone and has no internal awareness. Moon Kang is shy and introverted and the early romantic exchanges between these two are extremely funny and enchanting. The music is excellent, the cast is superb, the story is well written as it slowly evolves and it is directed at a great pace. An outstanding drama with a gothic feel.",10
East Asia,"Excelent story.. Excelent actors. Excelent photography and quality
Every character has a special and deep story to tell us...and all of them are great
This is one of the best Kdramas y've ever seen",10
East Asia,I've been watching everyweek and so far it never waste my time and it will make you sit at the edge of your seat every episode.. One of the best kdrama I watch. Combination of drama and romance. Thumbs up to the actors of the show. Also the director and the writer!! Superb!!,10
East Asia,"This show explores and fleshes out themes in ways different from what I've seen in usual kdramas. It has many original concepts but still has that korean trademark chemistry between the leads that will give you the heart fuzzies.In short, come for the romance but stay for the story. Also, Kim Soo Hyun is definitely not human... how can he still look so good after all this time?!!Side note: this is my first time seeing Seo Ye Ji and I am blown away. She is so appealing and extremely good at portraying her character. Currently checking her other works just to see more of her and her acting prowess!!! It's easy to overdo Ko Mun Yeong to the point of campiness but Seo Ye Ji plays her with such nuance that KMY feels like a real person.Why I love this show:
1. The character development of the leads and main supporting cast across the episodes is nothing short of amazing - each main and supporting character has depths that shine in different moments throughout the series.2. The sets are beautifully made and the crew's attention to detail is astounding. The animation and other means to portray mental health and how different disorders are experienced gave me new insight into what these people must be feeling when they go through their episodes.3. The laughs and humor in this dramedy are well placed, feel natural, and let's you laugh along. The serious moments are heavy enough to make you cry. The heartwarming moments are genuine and can make you both laugh and cry.4. THE CHEMISTRY AMONG THE LEADS IS NEXT LEVEL!!! The filial chemistry among OJS, SYJ, and KSH is so good you'll be rooting for each of them until the end. The romantic chemistry between KSH and SYJ is explosive!!! Can they please just be happy together?5. The music is interesting and elevates the mood of the show.Why this show isn't a 10:
1. Everything about and regarding the ""main villain"" in this series is the one thing that feels forced... there are a lot of plot holes and convenient set ups needed to make this villain work in the world of the story.",9
East Asia,"The writer is a genius, lots of meaningful quotes, the acting of the players, especially Seo Yea Ji is amazing .. especially for episode 14 I think she worked really hard and deserves an award. Don't forget Kim Soo Hyun and Oh Jung Se, this trio is the best .. as a healing drama, this drama has made me learn and have a new perspective on life ..",10
East Asia,"This isn't your typical romcom Korean drama. Watch with an open mind cause this show touches the issue of mental illness. The characters may seem confusing and even toxic at first but if you continue to watch, you'll understand why they are the way they are. Each character develops in their own unique ways throughout this show so pay attention to that. What I personally love most about this show is the powerful chemistry of the cast. It feels natural. I'm hoping there's a second season. Absolutely love this show, it may very well be my favorite Korean Drama and I've watched countless of them. Thank you for this beautifully written and portrayed masterpiece!",10
East Asia,"It's a perfect story. Every detail is appreciate from the writer, director, profs, actors, music,and a lot more. I gained knowledge and it give inspiration this hard times. Is a stunning artwork! You must watched! Everything for me is perfect I always rewatching and never get bored. I always have fun because of this kdrama especially to character ko Mun-yeong, actor seo ye ji is super talented actor. Hope they have more awards and gain viewers because this drama is worth watching for??????????",10
East Asia,"This is the best drama i have ever watch! This drama was different with another drama! This drama give us many moral value , very healing and very recommended! i still can't believe that the drama will end in this week .. i hope there's a second season on this drama with the same casts :))))",10
East Asia,"From the script writing to the actors, this kdrama is just a masterpiece. It touches on mental health in a way that kdrama don't. The reality of mental health is depicted and often is really represented not just giving us a happy ending to some of the patients stories. From happiness to sorrow to anger, this kdrama is an emotional rollercoaster but it is amazing",10
East Asia,"The story of a children's storybook writer with ASPD, an older brother with autism and his selfless caretaker younger brother. Yet the one who seems the most normal is the most broken and needs the most healing. A rollercoaster journey of emotions that provides a different insight to life for all three of them. This drama undertakes a journey of how each of them learns to find happiness, each in their own ways but each with the help of each other.",10
East Asia,"It's okey to not be okey best drama of the year, so beautiful storyline, excellent actors, very good job the directors and the writers and may more... congratulations.....",10
East Asia,"This drama can make you laugh, crying, and falling in love at the same time. Very recommended",10
East Asia,"It's okay to not be okay/psycho but it's okay is not your typical K-drama.Love everything about it. The casts, the chemistry, plot, cinematography, the OSTs. It promotes mental illness awareness as well. The character development is on point tho~ and it has deep meaning behind the storylines.I've watched so many K-dramas (being a kdrama fan since decades ago) but for me, this is by far the best K-drama. Ever.
This is truly one of a kind drama that doesn't deserve even 1-sec skip.Hands down to the IOTBNO/PBIO crews!PS: i love KimSooHyun & SeoYeaJi...
their chemistry is insane and it's on another level.
I ship them and hope they will become real couple ^_^",10
East Asia,"This is for me the best KDRAMA i have ever watched. Its a LOVE story in every sense of the word. It did not only show romantic love but also familial love, love for others especially for those people who need it the most. Every episode tackle an issue and gives light to it that melts or breaks your heart. Worth every time you spend watching them. Kim Soo-Hyun and Seo Ye-Ji's visuals are just a bonus. Kudos to all staff and crew for making such an incredible piece of art!",10
East Asia,"This is the best drama i've seen in the past 4 years. the story is unique and informative in away. it tacles a very sensitive topic but they executed it beautifully. this drama is by far the well written, well directed and well portrayed by the actors. no bad acting at all!!! everyone deserves an awards for the great portryals not to mention the chemistry between the leads, it is on fire. it would be hard to outopced this kind of drama and chemistry.",10
East Asia,"Since the beginning of this drama, I have learned so much about mental health and life in general. I was very short-tempered before this drama and now I learned to count to 3 before exploding ??. This dramas was filled with SO MANY quotes that pertained to my life and I can say that it made me a better person. I never would have believed a kdrama could give me a different outlook on life until this one. If you are contemplating if you should watch it, I DEFINITELY suggest you do and take in what they are trying to say about life. Also, WHAT AN AMAZING CASTING THE DIRECTOR DID BECAUSE IT WAS PHENOMENAL ACTING FROM EVERYONE.",10
East Asia,"Best Kdrama period! The pair, Casts, storyline, and cinematography. Thank u so much PDnim, Writernim, and all the crews and staff. Hwaiting!! Seo Ye Ji sarangahe",10
East Asia,This drama give me so many lessons and messages about life. This drama helping me healing. And i'm sure the same goes for other people who watch too. A healing drama. Indeed.,10
East Asia,"The storyline is unique and powerful, it serves you dark fairy tale with valuable life lessons.The acting is very impressive, even could make us feel connected with their feelings. I love how this drama bring up mental health issues to make us more open-minded about mental illness. I recommend you to watch this slowly, and feel the healing process of each characters.",10
East Asia,"Almost every line is meaningful in this drama. It was like a rollercoaster of Emotions, Heartfelt, Fun, Romance and about Mental Health... Also it has all the Genres:-Comedy, Romance, Bromance, Dramedy, Suspense, Thriller (Kind of), Horror(it feels at some points). I guess not even an single character was ignored, story of Lead cast as well as Supporting cast was well covered and ended, all of them have done a great job. So just go and watch it with full expectations.",9
East Asia,"So many things about this series are exceptionally good. The journey of healing and learning of each of the characters from the main leads to the various patients is very moving. Admirably tasteful way to deal with mental and emotional issues on screen. The central love story is so involving because their pain feels profound. The incomparable Seo Ye Ji as writer Ko Moon-young is unforgettable - strong and vulnerable, finally a real step forward for K drama heroines. Enjoy each sentence she utters in her signature low voice. She has some memorable and often hilarious dialogue. A far cry from the Cinderella type heroines of early melodramas. And her outfits are stunning - perfectly suited to her tiny waist.
Kim Soo-hyun is well cast as caregiver Moon Gang-tae. He isn't a larger than life hero but instead a man with pain and burdens. He looks more mature here. The pairing of the two leads is right. Much better than The King Eternal Monarch where there was little chemistry between Lee Min Ho and Kim Go Eun.
Oh Jung-se gives a likable convincing performance as autistic Moon Sang-tae, In less capable hands the character could have been annoying or tiresome but he made the brotherly relationship very touching.
The production values are very high. From the well integrated animation of the stories to the quirky Tim Burton style house, it all has a high quality feature film standard feel to it. To cap it all off the ending is a good and satisfying one. For all those who have been disappointed by unsatisfying endings in K dramas this one helps to makes up for some of them.
A must watch.",10
East Asia,"IOTNBO healed me in a lot of ways. I'm gonna be so disappointed if it doesn't bag Grand Prize and Best Drama on the next Baeksang Arts Awards. Beautifully written, well-directed, and well-acted. Not to mention the superb animation which felt like watching straight out of a Tim Burton animated film. A daily reminder for everyone that ""It's okay not to be okay"".",10
East Asia,"An impeccable ending, and each episode made me to learn and acting is out of the line. I just finished the drama and i will miss it for sure, the title is justified, and i recommend every one to watch .",10
East Asia,"Leave aside stereotypes for a while and watch this show to understand solution to real problems we have in this world.
Writing, acting, execution and music was amazing.
As soon as you relate to characters, it becomes a beautiful emotional roller coaster for you.
Kudos to the team for such magical creation.",10
East Asia,"Great story line.
Brilliant directed by Park Shin-woo.
Amazing cast with beautiful Seo Ye-ji and Handsome Kim Soo-Hyun.
Supporting actor Oh Jung-se(Sang tae) is lit.Great story building in each episode. New concept of animated story line was a great experiment by team. Easy to understand through animated graphics.
Bro-mance and Rom-Com both combo are amazing.An emotional nad heartfelt good bye to this series.",10
East Asia,"Loved the unique concept of the series. The storyline, the characters, the location and its aesthetic beauty just added more to the attractiveness of the show.I was completely hooked until the very end. There are quite a few things to learn from this show. I felt i could relate to some of the events in my real life. The beautiful collaboration between a fairytale and reality was so so beautiful to witness. This is my second K-drama this year aftet Crash Landing On You and i am really glad that i watched this! :)",10
East Asia,"IT'S OKAY NOT TO BE OKAY (2020)***
Haeng-ja: Humans are too weak. That's why they suffer, like your patients.
Doctor: People stick together because they're weak. We lean on each other like this. That's what makes us human. Will you ever be human?
***A beautiful story of love, friendship, brotherhood, family, autism, trust, and acceptance.Perfect screenplay! Magnificent cinematography!
Bravo to all the actors! Many thanks for adding colours to my weekends. I love Gang-tae(Kim Soo-hyun), Mun-yeong(Seo Ye-ji), and Sang-tae(Oh Jung-se) the most. I felt all their emotions. Superb actors indeed! They deserve awards for this drama. I cried on almost all of the episodes. Love the outfits of Mun-yeong. Love the soundtrack as well.This is gold! I give it a 10/10. I strongly recommend it! ??#itsokaynottobeokay

East Asia,"I thought it was the best drama i've ever watched. The plot, MUA, wardrobe, message in this drama greatly presented to the viewers.But i still wondering about some mysteries that how Moon Young's mother remain alive after her dad sink her to the lake and when she says ""I will take care of my son"" before she killed Sang Tae's mother. Any thoughts?",9
East Asia,"Okay, so let me start by saying I loved the whole concept of this show. The slightly ""other-worldly"" feel of it makes this show feel very different from anything I have ever seen. The acting is phenomenal, from Soo-Hyun's heartbreaking performance, to Ye-Ji's feisty, sadistic-but-fun anti-heroine, to Jeong-Se's unreal acting as an autistic man that is on par with Dustin Hoffman's Rain Man. The music is lovely, and the slow-build romance between Moon-Young and Gang-Tae is so wonderful to watch.Now for the flaw - the ""villain."" I absolutely HATED the whole plot-line of Moon-Young's evil mother. It would have been fine if she had remained dead and was just this haunting, painful roadblock for Moon-Young to get over. But instead she somehow survived a fatal fall down a staircase and being thrown into a lake by her husband? And no, this miraculous survival was never explained. Also her face completely changed, and apparently she just got plastic surgery to change her appearance, but somehow no one knew about this? Don't forget she is supposed to be an incredibly famous and popular author. And she was perfect at faking being a really nice and wonderful nurse at the psychiatric hospital that her husband just so happened to be admitted to - how did she even get the job? She just had a fake name and resume? Did no one ever check up on this woman? Honestly it was so dumb and unrealistic, and when she finally showed her ""true colors,"" she was just so over the top ""evil"" that it was laughable and totally ruined the whole mood.The show was saved by the performances of our main characters, but I'm glad they left the reveal of the mother till almost the very end, otherwise I might have stopped watching altogether. I think its worth a watch for the good reasons mentioned above, but the mother story line is something you will have to just ignore.",7
East Asia,Awesome storyline. Brilliant acting. Wonderful star cast. Every episode kept getting better and better. Stellar performance by every star cast. Left me wanting more of it. Just 16 EPs wasnt enough.,10
East Asia,It was such a healing drama...the character building was amazing...thanks for this beautiful journey....,10
East Asia,Really really really wanted to love this drama but it's too predictable. But I loved the acting and cinematography! Specially the actress was top notch. But too much unnecessary focus on side characters. I liked the emotional views in this drama. Loved how simple his 3 wishes were! Overall I would say it's overrated.,6
East Asia,"I am an Indian and watching kdrams for 7 yrs now. And I have no doubt this one is the best yet. My God, their acting was so phenomenal and realistic and not just main characters but the whole cast.
And obviously storyline was so unique and just perfect.
The end was perfect. I registered my IMDb account just so that I can rate this show .
In love with this series.",10
East Asia,"IONTBO us definitely worth a watch. Some parts of the show looked somewhat inspired by Tim Burton, and some other parts like the books illustrations reminded me of the movie ""Jack and the Cuckoo Clock Heart"". The cinematography is splendid, and the script is thoughtfully written.Oh Jung Se as Moon Sang Tae played an award-winning acting as the autistic brother. I was surprised to see him being so into the character, as I saw him played another corporate role in another Kdrama. Seo Ye Ji is terrific as the beautiful, moody, anti-heroine character Mun Young, and Kim Soo Hyun as Moon Gang Tae looks balanced in complementing her.I loved how the ending provided the freedom for the three main characters. Only that I was wishing for a more explained back story of the evil Do Hui Jae ( Koo Mun Young's mother), like how she survived although she was like bleeding to death, how did she have so much money to change her face, why she was behaving like a lunatic despite being a famous writer.. which were all left unanswered. Major plothole there.The supporting characters are filled with kind hearted people who taught a lot about humanity and goodwill. Watching the show kind of opens a new window of seeing life in a different perspective, like finding happiness although life itself feels so dark and gloomy.I think I will rank this kdrama 3rd after CLOY and Descendants of the Sun.",9
East Asia,"This show has absolutely changed my life in view on mental health it was astonishing amazing brilliant emotional cunning!!!!!!!!!
Absolutely adored every second and every moment of the show. Recently have discovered K dramas was but this is not only one of the best K dramas but actually one of the best dramas out there in existence in the world.",10
East Asia,The best k drama i've ever seen in my life. Everything just perfect. A must see K drama.,10
East Asia,"""It ain't about how hard you hit. It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward.""This line from ""Rocky Balboa"" seemed to ring loudly in my mind as this series concluded for me. Indeed, no one goes through life unscathed, and some take even greater lumps than most. However, no matter what we've suffered, it's perseverance that matters most. Not giving up. Always push on.To my mind, K-dramas are dominating the television airwaves. While I have watched a few bad ones, most have been anywhere from great to superb. ""It's Okay to Not Be Okay"" certainly fits the ""superb"" bill for me.As several reviewers have already mentioned, this is a very unique series that deals with the mental and emotional suffering that everyone has to deal with at some point in their lives. Perhaps that is what makes the series so relatable as well as profound with the central question: when do people finally acquire the courage to take responsibility for their own lives?For so many people in this world, we blame our parents for our misfortunes and our sufferings. Why didn't they love us more? Why did they mistreat us? Where was that unconditional love we were supposed to be showered with?Unfortunately, the answers we tell ourselves are filled with as many lies as the questions we come up with. Perhaps we weren't worthy of that love. Perhaps we simply weren't good enough. No matter what answers we contrive in an attempt to ""makes sense of it all"" we, too often, play the victim.Gang-Tae is a caregiver at a local mental hospital. His body is riddled with scars given to him by patients who have lashed out at him. However, his physical scars pale in comparison to his emotional ones. In short, he truly believes he is not worth loving.Sang-Tae is Gang-Tae's older brother with fairly severe autism. He suffers from a moment in the past when he was present for his mother's murder. The murderer threatens to kill him should he ever tell anyone about it. So scarred by the event, Gang-Tae placates his brother by making sure to move every autumn of every year. He somehow wants to be free of his burden.Ko-Muen Young is a woman who was touted as a princess by her mother; someone who is head-and-shoulders above everyone else. And people should be treated with disdain and contempt for being so beneath her. This is a woman who has no idea how to interact with people. She had no filter, and therefore, speaks her mind and her feelings, both good and bad. She is a little girl desperately wanting someone to love her.The irony is that all three characters, in some way, shape or form, represent some of the most common fears and desires of every single person on this planet: to be worthy of love, to be relieved of our fears and burdens, and to simply be loved for who we are.The series masterfully navigates how all three characters are able to find peace with themselves, and perhaps, even some joy culminating in a last episode that will have you smiling and crying at the same time.Yes, it is okay to not be okay. It is okay to fall. It is okay to be knocked down. It is not okay to give up and stay down. Everyone must find the courage to get up and keep going. That is the series' central message.The performances in this series are top-notch all the way around. However, accolades must truly be given to Jeong-Se Oh (Sang-tae) who turns in a performance that easily rivals Dustin Hoffman's ""Rain Man."" In fact, to my mind, Jeong-Se Oh's performance surpasses it. He is truly deserving of any awards he might acquire for one of the best acting performances seen in a long time.This series has almost everything: a mystery, laugh-out-loud moments, heartfelt moments, cringeworthy moments, and plenty of relatable moments, depending on who you are.I cannot recommend this series highly enough. It should almost be required viewing. For perhaps, you might find some ""healing moments"" of your own as you watch this show, and be presented with the question: will you blame others for your problems? Or will you find the courage to begin living your own life?",10
East Asia,"I dislike drama slash romantic shows. But for this series I will make an exception.
The storyline, the acting, perfect casting, the location, even the in story fairy tale books/stories were brilliant!!! Just brilliant. I am just blown away. And for someone who loves korean horror/zombie shows (i.e. kingdom, train to busan, etc) - that is a big thing. I am absolutely amazed by the three main leads. The supporting cast are also top notch. Its the most well cast production Ive seen so far.
This is a k-drama that I can definitely recommend. It is a brave show that tackles mental illnesses and I am so very proud how this has been done thru this show. Good on you for doing this. We need more of these shows!
I wonder if those fairy tale books are actually real books? If not, then they should be. Loved the storylines there too! and the artworks!! Love it.
And last but not the least - the female lead's outfits! OMG - just for her outfits I would watch the whole show! I dont know who she is but she carries them so well, i love her acting and i love her voice!!!! Hope to see more of you in the very near future!",10
East Asia,I love moon young stories and her inference from famous stories like beauty and the beast . its a drama full of emotion thanks two wise script writer and talent actors .,10
East Asia,"This story is one that will stay with me forever. The fairytale themes made the atmosphere magically beautiful, the main couple has amazing chemistry, the actors deserve all the awards for their amazing performances, the OST is incredible, everything is just perfect.It's easily my favorite K-drama of all time. Everyone should watch this :)",10
East Asia,Grt series funny sad etc and make it better the actress is well BEAUTIFUL,10
East Asia,"I don't get the hype really. I watched 4 episodes so far. For me I wouldn't mind if the leads were just annoying. but glorifying these annoying behaviours, I can't accept it. FL with Antisocial personality syndrome, a dark past, Different from the usual fairy tale nature of the romantic dramas. This would have made a great plot. but they focussed on the dark side of it. For eg, The assembly man's son ran away with the FL and caused a big scene at the election campaign. They showed that as FL done a good thing. I get that his father is not a good person. but what she did was not the right thing. Also Violent portrayal of scenes in a children's storybook. FL leads says it has deeper meaning to it than what is shown on the outside. But how children are supposed to understand that. But that would have been okay because the character can't really understand peoples or emotions. But the writers chose to glorify that. It is okay to not be okay. But it is not okay glorify the factors that makes them not okay.
I am gonna watch the show anyway. will update this then.",7
East Asia,"Strong story and unfamiliar
I was enjoyed every minute of this drama
Top 2020 drama
Thanks for the writer and actors and producing and everyone in teamwork for this unique drama",10
East Asia,"Very good story, script.
Recommend to watch for people open minded.
-^_^
Lady is so beautiful, I like her and all acting is good.
To be watch!!!",9
East Asia,"I love Kim Soo Hyun, let's get that out of the way first. He's the reason why I watched this show. He's a remarkable and versatile actor and devastatingly handsome. I've followed his career since Dream High and loved every one of his dramas...except this. I can see the premise of the show, and it was actually promising at the beginning. As someone who suffers from mental health issues, I could relate with that aspect of the show, although as one of the reviewers mentioned, it glamourized mental illness...that part of it I didn't like. I do appreciate the healing side of the show and how the characters eventually experience growth and transformation. I also liked how they related every episode to a fairy tale. The concept was there, the execution, not so much. Sometimes the acting was too cheesy. I even felt KSH hammed it up in certain scenes. I liked the Sang-tae actor, he deserves an award for his portrayal. I also liked the secondary characters like Juri, Jae-Soo, and Manager Lee. KSH and Seo Ye-ji did have chemistry off screen (I watched BTS too many times to know), but I personally felt something was missing from their on screen chemistry. The plot was predictable-I already knew, for instance, in episode 2 or 3 who her mother was-and the script was pretty basic. It didn't give me anything new or something to ruminate on. It was literally just a CW show with Korean actors, and one of the reviewers on here actually mentioned how the appeal of kdramas is that they are for the most part more chaste...this was pretty daring, I must say. Very Hollywood, indeed...and I guess that's the effect of kdramas becoming more internationally known, and with the Netflix crossover, one can definitely feel the Western influences on the show (e.g. music soundtrack which I felt didn't match the show's mood). There were many ship-worthy scenes, which I would like to go back to, but the beauty of Gang-tae and Moon-young's relationship was ""the chase"". Once it got to ep. 15 and 16, where the two become an item and do their business, it lost its appeal for me. It seems like the show knew what the audience wanted and gave it regardless of whether the quality was good or not. Some scenes could have been done differently or left to the imagination, but I'm obviously the minority on this. Then the villain which **spoiler alert** the show built up to be this super evil and scary witch-once she makes her reveal, she's eliminated in the same episode like a pesky fly lol a little anti-climatic. I laughed because she waited, what was it, 25 years? To have her revenge. It would have been better if she just tormented her daughter from afar. She got caught by the police so easily and wasn't much of a threat. Finally, never in real life would I buy a book by Moon-Young for a child lol what crazy parent would? And ep.16 was unnecessarily long...even felt longer than the Lord of the Rings 3's ending.",5
East Asia,"By far one of the best K-drama I've seen. Kudos to Netflix for producing this masterpiece. Everything from the story line, the actors, sound tracks, costume - just wonderful. This drama will make you fall in love with the characters and side characters. Each character development is smooth and we'll thought of (not rushed like in some K-dramas where you can tell the only reason why certain things are happening is because it's near the end of the series/season).Truly entertaining, heart warming and an all around brilliant show.",10
East Asia,My first time to get addicted in a drama. I love the lead cast very much. ?? The drama is beyond perfect and highly recommended to watch.o,10
East Asia,The chemistry of the artists ughh I can't even explain but this by far is the best kdrama of 2020. I don't think anyone can beat it.,10
East Asia,"An absolute masterpiece in every essence. The story, the acting, the feelings you get from this as are just next level. This is our second K Drama after Crash Landing On You, living in the west we have now discovered these Korean series are light years ahead of anything we have seen before. If I could rate more than a 10 I would. Lastly the actor for the role of Moon Sang-Tae Should be given an Oscar or something equivalent, his performance was literally nothing other than outstanding.",10
East Asia,"The Storyline, Conflict, Plot Twist and Character Development from the beginning is very interesting to watch and follow! Also this drama also have so much meaningful Value, so that we can learn something from this drama. SYJ, KSH, OSJ played so well in this movie! Recommended to Watch!",10
East Asia,"Indeed it was a human healing drama. I myself learned more about the importance of having the warmth in life, how to love myself more, how to be more patient in a stressful situations, how to deal with certain people and how to forgive people, how to think twice before action and most importantly all the humans are equal, disability or Sickness doesn't separate people into different categories, after all we all are human... Each individual is weak, So we lean on each other... no one can live alone....Such a beautiful ending, outstanding acting, all the dialogues, scenes are delivered perfectly... simply amazing!! This story will always be close to my heart...When the things are hard in life, I'll never give up, I'll start again because it's okay to not be okay.",10
East Asia,"This drama Set the bar so high ! Everything is perfect from the opening to the ending. Such a masterpiece. The writing, acting, plot, cinematography, transition, screenplay, scoring, chemistrty between the actors are just on another Level. It's more than just drama, it's a life lesson.",10
East Asia,"This drama set the bar too high. The Acting, writing, scoring, cinematography, transition, screenplay, plot, the use of fairy tale metaphors, the chemistry between the actors, everything is just on another Level: Such a masterpiece.! It's Okay To Not Be Okay is more than just drama. It's A Life lesson.",10
East Asia,"This drama will be my always fav drama ever! I never too love drama like this, this is the first time i fell like iam very2 falling in love with drama! I love the acting of kimsohyun, soyeji, and oh jungse, they done a good job! The story was amazingggg. Tq for a writtternim, sutradara, and all of you who make this drama amazing! I hope this drama will be a daesang!",10
East Asia,"Almost flawlessThe storyline is not so common
The script is just sooo good
Well written
And the cast delivered it well
Im very impressed with Sangtae character development but i love all the characters
The casts did a really good job
From such a small character to the main lead, theyre just perfect
Not to say the chemistry between Kim Soo Hyun and Seo Ye Ji is beyond the earth
The chemistry of all the casts is actually beyond the universeJust a little bit disappointed with the plot
If you watched it youll know what i mean I
m still wondering it tho
But ill just forgive it since im very satisfied with the endingThank you for creating such a masterpiece",9
East Asia,The ending was a bit rushed. I wish they gave more backstory on the mother and had spent more time playing with the mother daughter relationship and the mother's return.,8
East Asia,"This is truly a masterpiece from the storylines, plot twists, cinematography, osts and superb actors. Thank you for allmthe casts, staff, writers, and people behind this brilliant drama series.",10
East Asia,"The Cast, The Director, Soundtrack, and the Story is truly impeccable.
Very humble drama with deeply message that can relate to its viewer.
It's Okay to Not Be Okay is a proof that it does not necessarily take a high fantasy and highly imaginative story to make a good drama like its predecessors.
The thing that It's Okay has while the other Kdrama doesn't is that they can touch the viewer with their deep meaningful story that leaves a good mark in people heart. Watching this drama is so healing, yet very entertaining. It is certainly award winning type of drama. Seo Ye Ji acting and beauty is beyond on point. She makes other K Actress in her age looks so so compared to her excellent beauty and powerful acting.",10
East Asia,This drama gave us a lot of life lessons. Hats off to the amazing actors and crew for this masterpiece. Best KDrama to date.,10
East Asia,"What an amazing show. I'e seen a lot of k- dramas but this one is totally different from the others. It is a blend of romance, horror, comedy and emotion. Tells us how a lonely person overcomes his fears and gets attached to the strangers and eventually finds a new family.
What makes this show a superhit is the brilliant performance by the cast and crew.",10
East Asia,"It's okay not be okay can be summarized in one word, brilliant!. The drama delves deep into emotions probably you never knew you could feel. The cinematography leaves you awestruck. Each character is etched with so much care that you land up getting emotionally invested in each of them. Seo Ye Ji is brilliant as a children's author with a personality disorder. Oh Jung Se plays an autistic older brother with so much conviction and innocence, it makes you want to give him a hug every time he is on screen .Finally Kim So Hyun who plays Moon Gangte brings a simplicity and rawness to the drama.Please do watch it, you won't regret it!",10
East Asia,This has been one of the most incredible dramas i've watched,10
East Asia,Most of the kdramas that link to past are well connected. But in this story it was something else. Acting was too good.In first few episodes the cinematography was different and fun but later on somehow it turned into conventional,10
East Asia,"This was a delightfully entertaining, emotionally compelling romance drama (with a touch of suspense)! Seo Yea Ji, by far, is my all time favorite actress: I will continually be fangirling her work no matter what character she plays! Seo Yea Ji, Kim Soo Hyun, and Oh Jung Se were exceptional in their performance together. Each one of them complimented the other perfectly to create a breathtakingly beautiful and brilliant drama: really fantastic chemistry! Wonderful narrative, excellent writing, fabulous script, and fantastic cast! Netflix does it again with an outstanding series! Bravo! Loved it!",10
East Asia,"This was my first Korean Drama, gotta say this show is pretty amazing!!!",10
East Asia,"I really love this drama so muchhh. The characters were good, the storyline was unique, and the fairytales part were so perfect. I enjoyed watching this and even titled this drama as the best drama this year, but......the ending?hmmm I don't think so. The ending really changed my opinion of this drama. Anticlimax. Bland ending. Or maybe I had high expectation from the ending. Many things in the ending didn't make sense from me. I'm just dissapointed with the ending but overall this drama really fun to watch, many moral values that we could learn. I have to agree with Kim Soo Hyun, 'this is a healing drama'",9
East Asia,"What can I say? I am in awe!!! The first episode alone got my jaw dropping! Up to the ending, I am left speechless as to how the story remain true to its uniqueness. This drama is one of the best story written out there, and in my opinion one of the best that I have watched not only for kdrama but I would say for movies and drama series in general. This is a stand out, not your typical clichè romance comedy. Every episodes with title adapted from fairy tale stories is so unique, offer relatable life learning experience and will leave the audience with lots of quotes to ponder. To tackle mental issues and show perspective from those suffering from it was done beautifully. And to mix it with a unique love story between three main characters is something you don't see often. It is dark, mysterious, sweet, serious, romantic, comedic, healing with touch of fairy tale lovestory that is so rare and refreshing to watch. I cried, laughed, resented, giggled, and made a lot of realization. Great script, wonderful story telling, and the casts are simply amazing. The chemistry between Seo Yea-ji and Kim So Hyun is off the charts! Seo Yea-ji was born for this role. She nailed it exceptionally at each episodes as a beautiful be""witched"" fairy tale author with anti-social personality disorder but at the same time you will be moved by her emotional vulnerability, child-like attitude as her healing progresses. Kim So Hyun as always is amazing and very effective in his role as a caregiver who gave so much sacrifices for his brother, look so strong and emotionally stable from the outside but finds himself weak and still lacking in so many aspects as he thought otherwise. He chose the right story as a comeback drama series. Oh Jung-se, as I have heard is one great actor in Korea and he has proven effortlessly in this story as a 35 yr old male with autism. Their journeys to emotional healing is so touching and will leave you with feeling of sadness, happiness, joy, and the realization of what life brings us unexpectedly. Everything in this drama series is beautiful. Cinematography is exceptional, the intro at the beginning of each episodes is not to be skipped, overall the animation and visuals is so stunning, and the OST is to die for! This is a drama series worth rewatching a thousand times to constantly remind us not to judge and that everyone has a back story. To summed up, It's Okay To Not Be Okay is just simply WOW!!!",10
East Asia,"I must say this drama is one of the best.
I'll make it really short.
The acting as emotions by the main cast is on another level. They really had me on an emotional rollercoaster ride.
The story is extremely unique and a well thought out story line with a major twist.
I am really happy I watched it.
Shout out to the cast and the script.",10
East Asia,Not a good drama can watch if u r bored enuf will be good if its taken properly with lot of products and making and location,2
East Asia,"Just finished but i am very much moved by this drama. It felt like i was moving with them in their journey. Brothers love friendhip family and loved one. Cried, laughed, scared and i am speechless. His love to his brother omg superv acting. Thank you for sharing love of joy ??????",10
East Asia,"I like the actors and the story is very nice!
But.. each episode lasts almost an hour (could fit better into 30 minuts) and very few happens..
I survived 5 episodes with a lot of facebook breaks..
This is something that happens in a lot KD's lately..
Try to keep me watch without leaving.",7
East Asia,"Combining fairy tale in the real life, the cinematography is so satisfying. I've been watching kdrama for more than 10yrs and this is the best I've ever watch. Try this",10
East Asia,"I know we were just halfway of the year but for me this is already the best drama of 2020. When the lead actor said that we will laugh, cry, laugh, cry 'cause of this drama, he didn't lie. I'm just glad this show was made, jinjja jinjja ""human healing drama""!",10
East Asia,"Watching many K-Dramas after the years I've found this to have such an intriguing and unique storyline. The details from the soundtrack, artwork, costumes, and character development were meticulously thought out. Oh Jung Se deserves an award for his role as an autistic adult--One he portrayed with dignity and deep understanding. I am from the US and I can unequivocally say that his method acting is on par with the greats. Think Eddy Redmayne in The Theory of Everything or Daniel Day Lewis in My Left Foot. As for the main characters they had a good chemistry-Seo Ye-Ji put all she had into the role and was a mysterious but ultimately playful and likeable personality. The writers really made you appreciate people for who they were despite their struggles. The nuggets of wisdom throughout the show on life, wellness and forgiveness shine through. I wish there was a second season as this show makes you want more and more. I don't normally say a show can be life changing or impactful but in this case the artistry, attention to details and careful storytelling feels like a love letter, packaged with care and hope. Truly 10/10 need more!",10
East Asia,"The main leads' acting in the emotional, dramatic scenes was very good. The scene that stand out for me are when Sang-tae cries out that his older brother wants to kill him in the hospital in front of the mural. A tear slides down Ko's cheek.The songs in this drama are VERY good! I must add to my Spotify!I feel I am more understanding in mental health after watching this drama. The drama shows various patients with a variety of mental health issues including PTSD, trauma, childhood abuse, autism, etc.Moon Gang-tae and Ko Mun-yeong's kiss scenes were really, really hot. This drama mentioned sexualities, condoms and even showed the two of them assumedly naked under the covers holding on to each other.Ko's fashion style - I love her designer clothes and gothic kind of style. She wears Dior saddle bags, Louis Vuitton scarf, designer heels. The drama didn't shy away from showing brands.",8
East Asia,"Specially if you have any of the problems that took place in the drama and you always felt like no one can feel or understand you.Here,you will feel understood ,you can see that others feel the same and that you never overrated the problem or overreacted. It teaches you to not keep your feelings inside you and to let them out cause if you didn't you might explode, it teaches you how love can change alot (not only relationship love but friendship and family love too) and whoever said that the ending is bad ,it's totally not but the drama is so great that we just can't
get enough
p.s:this drama helped me to face one of my own life problems and to understand it way better",10
East Asia,"Watched it for Kim Soo Hyun, and then hooked by Seo Ye Ji's Moonyoung.",10
East Asia,"Very dark, gloomy and depressing.How the: ""You are born like this"" about this lady justifies her being constantly rude, cruel and evil to other people and insult them, hurt them or destroy their lives?However, the psychiatric hospital is presented like a kinder garden. Really???I forced myself to watch up to episode 4. But after that I had enough. I could not continue.I am a great fan of Kdrama. I am really an addict. I have never given less than 8 stars to kdrama series. But this one was totally unacceptable for my taste.The 3 stars are only for the good actress acting, the cartoon and the cinematography. Otherwise it would be 1 star.If you are already depressed, don't see it. You will worsen.",3
East Asia,This drama would be our best K-Drama of the year. It elucidates mental health. The visuals are impressive. Not your typical ROM-COM dramas. This drama is everything you need (Perfection).,10
East Asia,This series is a ?masterpiece ? one of the best kdramas i've watched so far,10
East Asia,"Brilliantly done with subtle and not so subtle messages threaded throughout the episodes. I can't say too much without spoiling it, but it starts out the first few episodes with some scenes that may be interpreted as quirkinesses or silly, but stay with it and you will discover such deep and profound meaning in this movie. The acting was superb and the dialogue soul piercing and moving. I have been a fan of K-dramas for 10 years and I have watched at least 70 or 80 of them and this is one of the best. I'm so glad that Netflix has started investing in original K-Dramas. I have also worked in the mental health field so I have an extra appreciation for the context of this film series. This has drama, thriller, crime, mystery, romance, all rolled into one, with a spectacular scenery to boot.",10
East Asia,"I watch kdramas since 2000 and this one is by far my favorite. It's extremely entertaining and addicting. The direction, the script, the acting, the cast, the image, the soundtrack and so on are great.",10
East Asia,The series has a very good mixture if expressions and the actors nailed it mainly seo ye ji and kim soo hyun,10
East Asia,"GREAT STORY, STUNNING PHOTOGRAPHY, GREAT DEVELOPMENT, TOP TIER ACTORS AND ACTRESSES, FEEL-GOOD ENDING. This drama has everything go watch it if you haven't",10
East Asia,"From the title, Itself ""It's Okay to Not Be Okay"" just hit the theme of the drama to be a 'healing'. This is the Best drama I watched so far. It's not about fantasy or heavy drama or a funny story but it's about how we heal with the help of others, and to help ourselves. The way how they slap the real problem in this society, just hit me, us, harshly. We connect to the drama that tells the world on what we feel, emptiness, loneliness, & abandonment. Episode 4 hit me differently when Moon-Young said ""You also won't understand me until you die."" because Gang-Tae said her to first because all his bottle up of feelings just burst. It's just no matter what status or situation you are we are still different. If you think life is hard for you to compare to others, you don't know their story, you might know the feeling & pain but we are different physically, emotionally & mentally. Don't compare your situation to others. Yours is yours, mine is mine, every one has different struggles.I'm telling you pal, you won't regret watching this drama. Best Storyline, Best Cinematography, Best Production, Best OST, Best Couple, Best Cast & Best Ending.",10
East Asia,How great to have the characters evolve and keep going for the silverlining through all kinds of break ups and make ups. Love the soundtrack and score. Love the great sense of humour. Love the refreshing take on the so-called human nature. Much much appreciated I will revisit this universe for sure.,9
East Asia,"Its okay not to be okay will be remembered for how it was beautifully and masterfully done from the plot , the cast, ang their acting.",10
East Asia,"I'm not all about those cheese romance TV shows. But my god this was unlike most romance TV shows (and romance movies) I have seen in my life. Impossible to not fall in love with every single character. Loved every single one of them. Even the questionable ones. It's not just the romance, but the family dynamics and the friendships as well. Not to mention that manager and his secretary constantly bickering was hilarious. Undoubtedly one of my favorite shows.",9
East Asia,I feel sad for all Korean drama next to this drama (It's Ok to not be Okay) because it has set such a high standard.,10
East Asia,"I really loved this k-drama. Normally I don't binge dramas, but I watched this one in one week (which is fast for me). I will say I am a TOTAL chicken and a few scenes freaked me out or made me feel a little scared, but if you are a chicken you should be okay. I think I was more startled bc I wasn't expecting that from this show based on reviews and recommendations. The character development builds really well and the show keeps a good pace the entire time. This is not one that will disappoint you in the end or leave you confused. There were only a few MINOR plot holes, but overall pretty good. This is also a little bit of a heavier drama, but there are some comedic moments. It's worth it for the romance, they have a strong screen chemistry.",9
East Asia,"As my title says, this drama is certainly different from what I've seen until now, and it's good, really good. And the actors do a marvelous job.
This drama will get you through a very large spectrum of emotions. So it's a must-see. It really is.",10
East Asia,"I have watched many noteworthy titles like Goblin, you who came from the stars, descendants of the sun etc. Nothing even comes close to the near perfection of this drama.
With such a brilliant cast, the emotions on the screen seem very much real.
This drama is a sure keep and my applause to the cast, director, script and last but the best the OST. Just brilliant!!",10
East Asia,"The story is wonderful, but something is missing from the plot I think.. so that's why it's 9/10. Everything else is perfect. The cast, how they act, the screenplay, storytelling, and of course the main thing in this kdrama is the emotion, the connection, and the messages.. it's simply the best.finished watching at *10/08/2020*",9
East Asia,"As an expert in this field, I see all sides of humanity. I've learned that everyone has a story... For the most part, this series was accurate. If you want to see the many sides of mental illness and how we become who we are, and the courage it takes to heal, please do yourself a favor and experience this. I cannot recommend this enough. Stellar performances from the leading and supporting characters. Adorable moments and heartbreaking at the same time. Do not miss this.",10
East Asia,"After the first two episodes I was surprised of the dark humour, it looked a bit like a Tim Burton Tale. It's not a too big spoiler to say that this develops to a very deep love story. There are other K-Dramas with a more surprising screenplay. But not so many with just a good and likeable cast, a great cinematography and deep interest to its characters.",9
East Asia,"There is a lot to love about this show. Great characters with interesting personalities, story-telling and animation, some dark themes. It culminates in a touching ending that for me made me miss the characters once it was over.",8
East Asia,"Best Kdrama I've seen in a long time. Everything from the visuals, castings, OSts, storyline, etc... is just spot on. A well produced drama that tops all kdramas byfar. Its atypical.",10
East Asia,"While watching last hour of show I was happiest person. The complete show is emotional rollercoaster throughout. I'm really proud of Moon sang tae ! Each character with its unique storyline and something to tell you, teach you.
It isn't just cliche HEA. Wonderful soundtracks, lovable and tearful.",10
East Asia,"Am pretty old for this.However I've registered this accnt.for IMDB just to rate this Drama. & this Drama is Unique & portrayed well. As I would rather say that ""I have an elder Brother who's been A Psychiatrict patient for more than 35yrs. & it's not because he wanted to,' its because he could not over come it"". Anyway , Kudos to all the Cast specially The Trio ( Seo Yea Ji,Kim Soo Hyun , Oh Jung Se)who made the whole story meaningful. Its A package & Beyond Expectation!??????. CONGRATS HOPE TO SEE THIS DRAMA IN UPCOMING AWARDS.",10
East Asia,"I hardly give any reviews or should I say close to none at all. I have watched gazillion kdramas and to be honest it's very hard for one to penetrate in my top 10 list and this just barged right into my top 5. The narrative, the score, the cinematography, the casting, the plot and the direction, everything was flawless. The actors brought out the role of their characters so well, the score gave the perfect feel during the moments and the fairytale graphic was an ingenious idea that made me emersed into the story that it felt like a vivid dream. This is not just a drama, it's an experience that I'm glad I did. It's a slice of life and I honestly found place in some beautiful scripted dialogues and especially the name itself couldn't have been more apt for this drama. It's okay, to not be okay.",10
East Asia,"Binged 22hrs of TV perfection in 4 days!
The message is so important and if you strip away some of the KDrama eccentricities, we can all relate to the pain these characters went through, the effects on their mental health and (spoiler alert) how they found healing. I really related to the one of the male leads in how he sacrificed his happiness to look after his brother - all apart from his ridiculous good looks.I strongly recommend watching it and if you've never watched a Kdrama before here's my breakdown of what to expect:
Episodes 1-3: what is going on? But... I'm falling in love with the female lead (Seo Ye-Ji)
Episode 4: First cry. OK I'm invested now and I'm in love with the female lead.
Episodes 5-13: You'll laugh, cry and repeat. Also who needs sleep! Same feelings about the female lead
Episode 14: I don't want this to end
Episode 16: WOW!Special mention to the actor Jeong-se Oh who plays the autistic character Sang Tae. - what a performance! Incredible acting.In these dark 'rona times, we need a show like this. Stick with it - you wont be disappointed. Did I mention I was in love with the female lead?",10
East Asia,Could had be done in 10 episodes but still amazing!A roller coaster of emotions and a stunning production.Jung-se Oh acting is so good! One of the best performance I recently saw!Give it a try :),9
East Asia,"Watching this really gave me emotional roller coaster, the issues about mental healtiness really hit me. And thank you for seo yea ji, kom soo hyun, and oh jung see for amazing performance and the cinematography in this drama REALLY AMAZING. Thanks for director and screenwriter for give us many parallel scene, really smart move!",10
East Asia,"Settled acting by the lead pair and main characters
Screenplay, cinematography, taking, production values everything was too good...",10
East Asia,One of the best tv series with some very important topics related to mental health (which have been portrayed very well). Excellent acting by all the characters.And amazing sizzling chemistry between the lead pairs. Do watch this show BRILLIANT ????????????,10
East Asia,"It's Okay Not To Be Okay is something that I would recommend. Not a heavy drama but it will surely touch your heart. I personally fell in love with each of the characters because they all have that 'factor', all of them contributing to the very beauty of the film, to feel love and to feel loved.",9
East Asia,"I specifically just made an account to leave this review. Simply amazing.
The subjects covered in this series, the acting and the cinematography was perfect. Oh Jung Se played his role spectacularly, I was in tears again and again watching his amazing portrayal of an autistic older brother. If you're in two minds whether or not to watch this believe me, you should watch it.
Brilliant.",10
East Asia,Recommended and must watch movie series. I could rate this above 10 if ever there is.,10
East Asia,"I recommend you to watch this serie, it had smtng particular",10
East Asia,"Thanks for the awesome performance of all actors and actresses. This drama brings me so much tears and laughs. It teaches me a lot of love and forgiveness, courage and self-development among family memebers and friends and peers. One of the best dramas in 2020!",10
East Asia,"I've seen a lot of kdramas before and this one is by far the best. Unique female lead character which is well portrayed by Seo Yeji, and I like how strong her personality is. It's not your your usual kdrama female lead. Kim Soo Hyun is as usual, his over the top acting, he wouldn't have had those daesang awards for nothing. Every emotion can also be seen in his eyes, which is sooo amazing. Actually all the three of them (SYJ, KSH, OJS).. I was laughing, crying, then laughing again.. It's a roller coaster ride of emotions. And I love how the tables have turned at the last episode hahaha, that was epic.. I hope KSH and SYJ will be paired again in the future which is impossible since they change partners in every project they do.. IT'S A MUST WATCH KDRAMA. YOU WILL NOT REGRET WATCHING IT.",10
East Asia,"The best kdrama I've watched so far. It's message and the topic about mental illness makes it much more worth it to watch!! Highly recommended! The acting is super great and stunning! They portrayed the roles accurately! Also, the chemistry of syj and ksh!!! AaaaaAaaah!",10
East Asia,"I almost skipped on watching this title because originally I thought it was made by Netflix, I am really glad I watched it. It's an amazing KDrama and one of a kind acting from all the actors. A roller coaster of feelings. It has its cheesy moments but still a 10 in my book, it kept things entertaining from start to the end.Fortunately Netflix was not involved in the making of this show, because lately they ruin everything they touch. Luckily they just stream it on their platform so its not a cheap PC production like the usual Netflix stuff.",10
East Asia,"This is by far the best kdrama in 2020
The chemistry from the main leads are crazy
The cinematography is gorgeous
The story is really good!",10
East Asia,"Best actress and actor. Without Ko Mun-young , Moon Gang-tae can't perform perfectly! It's a perfect pairing! The chemistry of them in the drama is just awesome. Every part of their acting and dialogues is worth watching. And Sang-tae's exceptional performance in every episodes, he is so good. Not forgetting all the other actors and actresses in this drama, and especially the director Park Shin-woo and writer Jo Yong. All of you will be recognised for your hard work and efforts!I am sure this healing drama touched all our hearts and we want to see more of Seo Yea-ji and Kim Soo-hyun! Also Oh Jung-se! We want more of this!Pls sell your merchandises! (If can, even the books with Kor and English words)A fan from Msia.",10
East Asia,"If there is 1 notable good thing that happened this 2020, it is this drama release! It surprised and healed me beyond expectations and measures. I thought everything about this year is heaviness and tears, but I was wrong. And in my 20 years of watching Korean series, I can confidently say that this is one of the best - from the offbeat actors, to the cinematography, screenplay and soundtrack. Not everything is perfect but if you're into character-driven story, this is going to take you to another level if watching!",10
East Asia,"It is one of the best romantic series I watched. It will definitely in my top5. It's a simple story two people falling in love and overcoming emotional and physiological wonds.
It's different from usual kdrama and you wouldn't get bored for a single minute. The chemistry background songs were more than perfect. I didn't want it to end. It's more than just romantic series,I didn't want to say the spoilers.
Please watch it , it will make you laughf , cry and happy .",9
East Asia,"Literally a human healing drama it's so perfect not only the plot the cast, production scenarios ALL is PERFECT ....",10
East Asia,"Wow! That was an exciting ride. I stumbled upon It's okay to not be okay (IOTNBO) accidentally on social media. Actually, that title made me search more about it. And I was hooked from the beginning. Never thought I would see such a beautiful animation in a Korean Drama! That intro was amazing.
The story style, colours, artworks and the soundtrack are so beautiful. They give a fresh and unique experience to the viewers. Hats off to the creators for adding up these artistic vibes to the drama. I enjoyed the way how KMY storybooks intertwined with the original story.IOTNBO mainly deals with mental health. If you listen closely from every character, you learn something for life. Friendship, family, love and drama - it has everything that a typical KDrama has, but it's so much more than that.
Also, I must say the scenes with the patients in the hospital are so powerful. I can't express how much respect and gratitude I feel for caregivers in the health industry.Thank you cast, you all were absolutely brilliant!
Good job Netflix, Thank you for giving a chance to this unique story!",10
East Asia,"This is a series for 12+ of age. It's mostly a series written for children. Very childish. I wish some Korean series drama/romance are for the older target groups. It wasn't bad, but the series consists of 16 episodes. I only found it most interesting when something major happened and that was towards the ending of the series. It's a very soft storyline, nothing really exciting. All I was thinking during the first 6 episodes, okay a big spoilt woman with problems is harassing the man with words. The man is also having problems and you have to wait like 10 episodes until something romantic happens. Before this it's only staring eyes and some soft/romantic music while they stare in each others eyes. If you have plenty enough time and like slow and soft series you can watch this. If you are an adult and also like more adult series and a little bit faster paced series don't watch this. It will bore you.",5
East Asia,"It's okay to not be okay made me forget the Chaos of 2020, the boredom,negative things,and Quarantine. My greatest escape!!! the greatest human healing drama with Overwhelming Ending!!! This drama is SUPERB A UNFORGETTABLE, UNIQUE AND UNDERRATED! Hope many people watch and learned. From the Cast, Writer, Director, Producer, Staff, Animation, Books, Ost and details of the drama. There's many more you could learn. They deserve a lot of recognition and rewards! Huge respect for the people behind It's Okay To Not be Okay. This will be Forever in our heart! Thank you! A Masterpiece we will rooting for all of you!!! A lots of LOVE!! Hope many people make like this drama so the love will be center of the world.",10
East Asia,"In the midst of this pandemic this drama literally save me. It more just a drama. It's a MASTERPIECE!! From the casts, story, cinematography, all in all was superb! No dull moments. You will definitely feel all kinds of emotions while watching. Highly recommended! The chemistry of the lead actor and actress was one of the highlights of the story. You will definitely fall in love with them.",10
East Asia,I watched and was bewitched with k dramaI just don't get this one. I am dragging my feet just trying to reach the finish lineI can think of 10 plus series that I watched and are better than this yet lower ratingStands out the brothers immense role as a person with special needs.The story for the last 4 eoiseds 3 to 7 is not moving forward.Every 130 mins a small hint of something.Very average and unless the ending is wotkd shattering very disappointing,5
East Asia,"First of all,I watched this k-drama without expectations.But when the two episodes were on air i decided to watch it .So the introduction of the story with creepy animations wow hooked me inmediately .The three characters whose performance was amazing , made me fall in love with the story.The meaningful fairy tales were a plus to love the whole K-drama.As the actors said it's a healing drama which people could feel identified by the story.I cried many times,sometimes i felt like ko Moung young and sometimes like Moon Gang tae .In addition,the excellent performance of Oh Yung Se is undeniable.But i feel identified more with Moon Gang tae since he's ordinary like many of us that apparently we are okay but in reality we hide our emotions ,we're suffering and struggling with our past demons.Finally,the edition,OST and the strong chemistry between the protagonists made this show my favorite .So that's why this k-drama deserves everything in the world .If you are not hooked with the story, you can try to watch the show later beacuse i think a k-drama has its magic at the right moment.When you're suffering what the protagonists went through ,that's the right time to watch this amazing show .Definitely you must watch it!!?????????????????????????????????????????????????????",10
East Asia,"I've watched a lot of Korean dramas and this is by far the one that hit me hard right through my heart. I can relate to Moon Gang Tae a lot. Everyone deserves a standing ovation if it was a theatre play. Every aspect of the drama from cinematography, animation (can i just say that the animation was like from a Tim Burton movie), story, ost, lead character's chemistry, award-winning acting from the casts, everything in it deserves a recognition. i love it so much and i'm rewatching it every now and then.",10
East Asia,"The best actors with the best acting.!
And it contains a lot of informative content.!",8
East Asia,"The best actors with the best acting.!
Contains lots of informative content.!",8
East Asia,One of the best dramas I've watched and the actors really did a great job with their roles. Plus the chemistry of KSH and SYJ is on a different level. Will recommend it!,10
East Asia,"This is probably the FINEST foreign TV-series I've ever watched! It taught me some great lessons that will definitely make impact in my life.
The TV-series shows that our life isn't perfect at all, nobody is 100% good or bad in character, and we might not get the ""Happy Ending"" in our lives, because this is real life, & we've to deal with things throughout it.",10
East Asia,"This movie was the best
Kim soohyun and seo ye ji were wondeful",10
East Asia,"First of all what a cast we've got here specially Seo Ye-ji (Ko Moonyoung) and Oh Jung-se (Moon Sangtae) they were just stunning make me cried at some times and even relate with my darkest and saddest self and thoughts.
This is not a happy fairytale, its the most enjoyable darkest fairytale with some ups and lots of downs but at the end you felt happy, satisfied and just different.
I loved It and I loved Ko Moonyoung book stories.",9
East Asia,"Without a doubt, this series is the best South Korean series has been ever made in history without exaggeration.
In the beginning, I was not really interested in this show, but the perfect acting of its actors made me convinced that I would continue watching and with each episode the series' magnificence, enthusiasm and events increased. I want to talk about Soo-hyun Kim and Ye-ji Seo
They are undoubtedly the best original Drian romance story and their representation is convincing and realistic without making a frequent occurrence in all the other Korean soap operas.
This is the best Korean series and it makes the rest of the series garbage next to it.
Rate 9 but give it 10.",10
East Asia,"I Started Watching This Show Before my Exams And Yet I'm Watching It And My Exams Are tomorrow.
Yaa This Show Has Good Endings at each Episode Which Will Lead you To watch second episode immediately.There are Sometimes When I Think That I'm watching something like Bollywood But Storyline Is Great So No complaints.
just Watch The Show Without Knowing Anything about it You'll enjoy it more.
Watching Your First Kdrama Watch This You Won't Regret it.",9
East Asia,"This master piece will change your life.
You will get really motivated if your life is not going in the way u want.You will become different.",10
East Asia,"I have recently stepped into the world of kdrama with CLOY and then stumbled upon this gem. Loved the story, the way the story is told, the performances from all the actors and the cinematography. Everything is so perfect. I fell in love with Kim Soo Hyun and Seo Ye Ji together. Their chemistry is beyond beautiful and natural. Everytime they kissed my heart did a summersault, it felt so genuine and intense. The character developments thoughtout the series of all the chatacters are amazing. I feel like this show is very under appreciated among kdrama lovers. Do give it a watch and I am sure it won't be regretted..",10
East Asia,"The cinematography is excellent. It's clear that this was a big-budget drama meant to supersede previous K-dramas in filming quality. However, the whole premise is dull--garden variety sociopath falls for a stiff, self-abnegating man afraid of love. And pursues him. This is their story. I lost interest by the 4th episode. Unless there are interesting distractions, like wars, zombies, challenging primogeniture, escaping enemy territory, etc. a drama that focus entirely on a romance can become boring very quickly. It's better when the romance is part of a larger story and isn't the sole focus on the drama. After enduring the dragging pace and lack of stimulation I switched to another K-drama, ""Kingdom"", for more thrills.",7
East Asia,"Best drama ever , i love this drama so muchActors , edits , storyline everything is a best",10
East Asia,"This show is very special.
Here's why:OUSTANDING acting performances by the whole cast, especially the main cast though. While Kim Soo Hyun has been one of my faves for a while and is the best paid actor in Korea, Seo Ye Ji and Oh Jung Se captured my heart with their performance. I truly hope they finally get the recognition they deserve.UNIQUE plot with a rarely approached social issue, specifically in dramas: mental health and how to deal with people who have mental health issuesBEAUTIFUL storytelling and screeningEMOTIONAL journey: I laughed, I cried, I shivered. I was happy, I was sad, I was scared, I was angry.FUN FACT: I've never cried as much as I did watching this series LOL (but please note that this isn't an entirely depressing show because it's not!)This show made its way into my TOP 2 dramas next to Crash Landing On You.",10
East Asia,"A total surprise, going into this i thought it was going to be just a well made series with nothing really impressive about it... i was wrong.The three mains on this are just unbelievable, the story is interesting throughout the entire series, at no point feels boring or overwhelming, the character archs are paid off in a compelling way, some of you will probably tear. The support characters are relevant and have a great development, by the end you will miss them too.
And the story is just fantastic, the fact the episodes are long allows the story to breathe and feel like taking a pause (while still developing the story in a compelling way). Im just in love with this show, i have no regrets going into this, loved it and enjoyed it all the way through.",10
East Asia,"Great drama, from the first episode to the last one. The actors are amazing, almost all of them. The psychological developments of the main characters are really well done, showing us the pain and heal they go through step by step. Sang-Tae is definitely the most lovely character ever.",10
East Asia,"By far this is the most beautiful Kdrama I've watched that despite of the limitations due to covid the production was able to deliver awesome shots. Cinematography is impeccable. The 2 leads act as if they were really made each other. So much to learn even the side stories. Truthfully, this is a human healing drama... superb craftsmanship!!!",10
East Asia,"This is the first time ever i got addicted this much to a kdrama. The storyline is very unique ,bringing mental health issue and inserting a fairytale on it,each episode has a moral value. The cast are really great..I was amazed , they are really into their characters well. The cinematography is stunning, The ost are great too!",10
East Asia,"Seriously this drama so good at showing mental health issues so well and actors chemistry is phenomenal. And seo yea ji is so good at playing moon young ,her voice is no words to describe how good and sexy is !!",10
East Asia,"Shed a lot of tears on this one. I really enjoyed the story. Even though it takes longer time for me to finish it. I'm glad that I didn't give up. I'm gonna miss all of them, specially, Sang-Tae oppa. <3 I love the tandem of Gang-Tae & Mun-yeong.",8
East Asia,"It's the best romantic k- Drama series I have watched ever..Kim soo-hyun and seo-yea-ji have a true love chemistry between them and it can be seen on-screen as well...I loved the character played by both of them and their acting.The song breathe is simply breath-taking.I can watch it again and again .
And it has a perfect fairy tale ending.",10
East Asia,""" It's okay to not be okay "" is a conceptional drama. It nailed the atmosphere and the whole gothic, fairytale, mysterious, dark and eerie. The addition of the books worked fantastically, the setting was brilliant and the clothes of the leading lady influential.The story, however, of the drama was stretched. Looking back into it, nothing happened for some episodes, and the final result was the kind of 'easy' conclusion of the whole mother mystery. The side stories were underdeveloped and boring too. So, no, they didn't work on the story too much, as they focused on the clever dialogue and the atmosphere.Nevertheless, even though storywise my rating would have been 5.5, I can't really rate it less than 7 because of the performances. The three main actors were breathtaking, especially in the dramatic scenes and one should only watch it for those performances only! (and no, I'm not a fan of the actors, but I can't stress enough how excellent they were! plz give them an award!!)So, overall, seven out of ten (10/10 for the actors, 5/10 for the story)",7
East Asia,"I absolutely loved ""It's okay not to be okay"". Great message, great characters, great chemistry and plot. The cinematography was amazing and really loved the animations as well. Moon Gang-Tae was perfect and very well written, and Sang-Tae really adorable and cute. The slowburn romance between Seo Ye-ji and Gang-Tae was wonderful. Ps. The mental health issues were nicely done, wish more dramas did this!",10
East Asia,"The usage of fairy tales and central themes definitely kept the show grounded and focused. The show takes this even further by using familiar fairy tales to allow the audience to understand the characters better.From the very beginning, I had quite a few concerns about the show. For starters, it is about mental illness, and they are showing this to a predominantly Asian community who has never really had much content to deal with when it comes to the subject matter. The portrayal can either be glorified, derailed, or dull to the point the story won't really connect to the audience. Another issue was the murder plot, and how that could easily derail the story. These two concerns lingered until the end since the conclusion was really the only factor that can decide whether they were valid concerns or not.After finishing the show not just once, or twice, but three times (and counting), I am glad those concerns were invalidated, and it is obvious the writers made and effort to ensure none of them would be. Even better, the writers drive home the title of the series by showing that even until the end, none of the characters, both minor and major, are completely recovered, rightfully going against the idea that mental illnesses behave similarly to many physical illnesses which can be cured completely.The casting was beyond spot-on. Kim Soo Hyun's status as well as the nature of his previous roles makes his role in this show even more remarkable. We are so used to seeing him be so alluring not only in terms of his looks, but his characters' personalities in general. As I started this show, I was expecting him to be just as or even more alluring than he was before. Instead, I felt frustration (in a good way) towards his character's behavior, making me feel conflicted as this was not how I was used to seeing him. He looked glorious in the show but in terms of how his character was written, that was the best thing about him. To me, this is the role where his character felt the most humanized. He was perfectly imperfect, and he played it perfectly.I had never heard or seen Seo Yea Ji before this, and after watching her performance, it makes me wonder how many more underrated and insanely talented Korean actresses there are that I have not discovered. She not only played her role, but she EMBODIED it. She definitely had several shining moments. I also felt conflicted towards her character. Her intentions were wrong, but it seems that she can read people better than they can read themselves. She ends up doing the right thing for all the wrong reasons. In that sense, I loved how her character played out this way.I think it is worth noting that their humanized portrayal of a character with high functioning autism. I think they drove home the point that Sang Tae was different than others, but definitely not incapable, not just in terms of taking care of himself but of those around him as well. And just like every other character with this show, he too had mental health issues to deal with and flaws in his character that affected his relationship with others and his growth as a person. Making each character dimensional was just the list of things that has yet to be commended for with this show. And just like his co-leads, Oh Jung Se delivered a hell of a performance.Looking at the wider picture, this show does have international implications. The success internationally is one thing, but it does lead you to wonder how well Asian productions can stand against their western counterparts in terms of creating quality content. The writers of this show wanted to deliver a heart-felt story and from the beginning until the end, they clearly stayed with that purpose. The show was filmed stunningly and was written beautifully and creatively. The gist of the story was fairly simple, but the delivery is incredible. As a watcher from the US, it is painful to see the reception of this show not be as great as the dull, problematic TV shows gaining high viewership ratings.",10
East Asia,"It is indeed a human healing drama full of messages and life lessons. At first, I thought the story would be like another typical rom-com kdrama but my guess was wrong. I already captivated by the visual storytelling from the first episode.All of the actors are well casted and their superb acting were really satisfying.In my humble opinion, what made this drama unique is the way it successfully conveyed the messages on mental health with its mature acting and meaningful dialogue. I learnt a lot of things thanks to Its Okay to Not Be Okay. Totally worth to watch.",10
East Asia,"It's OK to Not Be OK is a splendidly told tale, beautifully produced, solidly written and featuring outstanding performances from the three leads and super-solid work from a large and talented supporting case.The story is set largely in and around a psychiatric hospital but where it would seem that the three leading characters are themselves in grave need of being institutionalized. The leading man, Moon Gang-tae, played by Kim Soo-yun, plays a caregiver with infinite patience who must live his entire life in slavery to his autistic brother, Sang-tae, outstandingly portrayed by the veteran actor Oh Jung-se, to a point where he is clinically depressed because of the relentless grind. He needs therapy, support, and, truth be told, a day off and a roll in the hay - none of which he ever allows himself to take (despite the fact that two beautiful women are on his case). Even when he has the opportunity to spend the night with one of them, he is so overcome with guilt and depression that he treats her beyond shabbily and then abases himself to his brother, who as can be expected reinforces his humiliation. Sang-tae is not to be blamed for this - he can't help himself - but, for a long time, all the mental health professionals surrounding Gang-tae ignore his obvious symptoms and needs and do little to help him to find balance. This enables a series of dramatic moments, to be sure, but it occasionally lends an air of unreality to the proceedings.The leading lady, Ko Mun-yeong, brilliantly acted by the sublimely beautiful Seo Ye-ji, is also a non-inmate, equally if not more in need of therapy. She plays a best-selling author of somewhat twisted children's fairy tales, with a knack for speaking the unfiltered truth about anything and everything in a way that is excruciatingly uncomfortable for her interlocutors. (I will never forget the lecture to the patients in which she reinterprets Beauty and the Beast as an example of Stockholm syndrome.). For all her self-centered personality, she is, nevertheless, the first person who gives non-material help to Gang-tae. (Everyone else just offers food or a place to stay.) At one point, she asks him straight out the crucial question, ""Are you going to sacrifice your whole life to atone for your sin towards your brother?"", a sin that he had not in fact committed. You have to ask yourself why it is Mun-yeong, and not the health professionals, who first has this insight.Sang-tae completes the trio. He is a talented illustrator but his gifts are overshadowed by his classically autistic personality, which makes him heavily dependent on his brother. Like Mun-yeong, however, he is a speaker of truth and he catches on in an instant if his brother is lying to him or trying to control him with petty deceits.The show's conceit is that these three heavily damaged individuals will find in each other the means to overcome their misery and the traumas of their past lives which, this being a KDrama, are deeply and somewhat unnecessarily intertwined. It's a slow burning process. In a flashback to one point in their childhood, Mun-yeong witnesses Sang-tae fall through the thin ice of a frozen lake. At first, Gang-tae, knowing already that he has been condemned by his mother to a life of servitude to his brother, runs away, but he relents goes back and saves him. Gang-tae in turn needs rescuing from the icy waters, and Mun-yeong throws him a float that keeps him from drowning. When they meet again years later, Mun-yeong slowly falls in love with him (as he with her) and, often against her own selfish instincts (or perhaps to gratify them), she tries to rescue him from his all-encompassing misery.Similarly, Gang-tae tries, at times, to help Mun-yeong overcome her worst self. No one else seems to think that she needs therapy or some other form of intervention. They just complain about her.And Mun-yeong and Sang-tae form an unlikely bond. It begins unpropitiously, with Mun-yeong trying to get close to Sang-tae as a way to break through Gang-tae's iron reserve but in the end, a genuine working collaboration and mutual friendship transcends their relationship with Gang-tae - in one delightful scene at the end, the two force Gang-tae out of the room while they working together on a book. I suspect that people familiar with autism will find some (not all) of Gang-tae's behavior in the later scenes suspiciously un-autistic, but on the whole the show portrays mental health issues in general and autism in particular with great sympathy and some considerable delicacy.There is, perhaps, some artificiality to the whole affair and it is not helped by some of the more irritating tropes of Korean dramas - repeated eavesdropping, characters get drunk, toss up and then forget everything, the incessant arm-grabbing (although for once the women do it almost as much as the men), and the frequency of scenes involving meals, including several irritating Subway product placements.Among the supporting performances, some shout-outs: Kim Chang-wan as the hospital director, Kim-Joo-hun and Park Jin-hoo as the much put upon publishers of Mun-yeong's books, and in a bravura cameo turn, Kwak Dong-yeon as a patient who, with a major assist from Mun-yeong, hilariously disrupts his father's political campaign. There are many others. Perhaps the weakest is the young but very busy TV actress Park Kyu-young, as Nam Ju-ri, a nurse and long-time friend of the brothers, who is appealing but bland, probably because the part is not well-thought out. She descends from a leading role as a true rival for Gang-tae's affections to a distraction who hangs around many episodes after that triangle has been definitively resolved in Mun-yeong's favor.What makes this show so watchable are all the extraordinary performances, lead and supporting, and the engaging character development and situational comedy and occasional drama that are more important than the relatively thin plot. The production values are strong and the use of Mun-yeong's fairy tales, especially the book she writes at the end with Sang-tae's illustrations, is moving and lovely. And I would be remiss not to mention the beauteous Seo Ye-ji's stunning fashions. They are striking but there is no questioning how much she adds to them. In the language of books, this is a page turner. Sixteen hour long plus episodes never felt excessive.",9
East Asia,It heals my wounds.The casts and their chemistry are overflowing.,10
East Asia,"This is the best drama of the year in my opinion, this drama is not about love but there are lots of lessons about life that can be learned in this drama, thank you for creating a very good drama for the writer and for seo ye ji, kim soo hyun, oh jung se for the amazing acting, staff and crew who worked hard to create this drama",10
East Asia,"IOTNBO indeed contains a different storyline than most of the dramas. I really enjoyed watching it. Pairing is cute!! The drama was mixture of Reality, mental health issues, touch of comedy moments etc! But one thing is that, it's imbd is overrated. Lot's of dramas out there with amazing storyline, famous too but their ratings is between 8-8.9. I feel this drama is overrated if you think about it properly. Otherwise I liked it!!!!??",8
East Asia,"I like this tv show but i think its a little overrated

East Asia,"This show is one of the greatest shows i have ever seen.It is one of those shows that after you watched it, you wish you had amnesia so you could watch it as the first time once again.It mixes comedy and romance with intriguing and unique characters, and it also blend some elements of storytelling in a very unique way.
Which really gets you hooked.
The first episode is used as a complete setup for the entire series and characters, which is very risky but it certainly paid off.
The chemistry between the cast is so intense that it really hooks you right in.
The script is magnificent and the music fits perfectly to every scene.
If you like a good story and being emotionally grabbed, this series wont disappoint in the slightest!!A clear 10/10 from me!",10

East Asia,"It's ok to not be ok is a HEALING DRAMA, It is not even asking us to like the characters. It is not asking us to approve of their actions. The most it is asking is for us to push the limits of our empathy, so we can understand where these characters are coming from.At first you may not like attitude/action of main lead(specially the female lead),I put myself to understand these character why they became like that, I am curious and I am not going to put the blame on one character to another.Story might be simple, but the acting really incredible!!kudos to the all cast and production of these drama.Overall, this drama really has placed in my heart, it hits me a lot maybe because we can be all like Gang-tae, Sang-tae, and Munyeong in real life. 100/10",10

This is not a typical k-drama. This is one of a kind!",10
East Asia,"I have an attention deficit disorder when talking about movies or shows on TV but with this particular drama, I was hooked like a leach. This drama not only depicts the meaning of true love but also the meaning of we are okay not matter what our circumstances maybe.I love the characters Moon Gang-Tae and Ko Mun-Yeong and how they balanced each other out. I want to see more of this duo on tv and on screen, hopefully this is not the last we're going to see them because it would be a shame.This is by far the best that happened in 20/20 for me. I am not an avid K Drama fan, I was able to finish the entire thing with my being so lack of interest in a long drama series but this one keep me and myself glued to the tv every week and I am still rewatching it every now and then. Some of the episodes are my happy pill.The chemistry of this two main characters are undeniably on fire! I mean, they are perfect for each other in reel and in real life so hopefully they found each other perfect too. The chemistry of the Moon brothers are so beautiful that you envy their relationship towards each other. Sang-Tae's character is so good, I've seen him mostly as villains in some other KDrama but with this, you fall in love with him. The relationship between bestfriends are also shown in this series and I want a bestfriend like that. The loyalty, the trust, the love and the respect for each other is beautifully crafted in this series.Glad I was hooked and now I am a big fan!. Highly recommend, if you have a hard time reading the subtitles in English, you can rewind and watch it again. Each episodes made you cry, laugh, and love it!I tell myself now Saikojiman Gwaenchanha. It's Okay to Not Be Okay!Happy watching!",10
East Asia,"I have been watching kdrams from quite a long time but this show is amazing better than DOTS, GOBLIN and any other popular KDrama ..the way it presents various illnesses and emotions is amazing",10
East Asia,"Indeed, a human-healing drama. It gives comfort and there's so many lessons in this drama that you can apply in real life. Relatable and very timely. I love also the visuals of main characters (Soo Hyun Kim & Ye Ji Seo) they are perfect and fit together. Their acting along with Jung Se Oh and other actors is superb.. I hope this will get a lot of recognition not only in Korea but also internationally. They are all deserving for giving us this kind of series. For me for all K-drama I've watched this is the best. Really the best. Shout out to Seo Ye Ji.. She's the prettiest actress and super versatile. I love her so much.",10
East Asia,AMAZING ACTING PLOT VISUAL FASHION....great life lessons...,10
East Asia,It have connected one way ir another to everyone watching this but at the end there will be smile and warm hearted feeling of acceptance that it sure is ok to not be okay.,10

East Asia,This is the best drama i've ever watched.. The story telling from the start to the end. The healing process.per episode by each character.. Best acting..best animated pictures.. All in all the best. This story is not all about love or what this story was a healing story for every one who had a bad past or a traumatic experienced who is not ready to overcome.this story gives me a life lessons per episodes.

East Asia,"I love seo yea ji

East Asia,"This is one of the best drama I have ever seen... All the characters are so good, and the couple looks really gorgeous together.... The story seems very interesting as well as uncommon.... It shows the reality ...
And finally you can say, it's okay to not be okay!",10
East Asia,Its been two months already since it ended and i still feel so attached with the story and the characters. How to move on ?!?!?! This show will always have a special place in my heart and will always be on my top tier list. And its sooo good it hurts ????????,10
East Asia,So happy that there are so many reviews and so many votes in such a short time. What should I say about the great grade ? AMAZING! I am literally going to recommend this to all my acquaintances even though they are not into Kdramas at all. I have to make sure to convince them to watch this because it is absolutely fabulous. Made me cry so hard and laugh with all mt heart at the same time. I have to search some lines and note then down just because the're too good. Just as you note quotes from books. That's impressive! I'm gonna stop here otherwise people will think I exaggerate but honestly..I'm not!,10
East Asia,"During the pandemic disease of Covid 19, we need some kind of the ways out for our emotions and feeling. This series is the one that we need for our ways out of fears, worries, anxiety and stressing. I would recommend you to watch. The actors and actresses are so talented and the main actress is really cute and scary. And I loved it souch. Thanks Netflix for such a romance and comedy.",10
East Asia,"Enough said!!! This is the Best Kdrama of 2020. The best assembly of cast, director and screenwriter. The Best in cinematography and editing. Dont forget the well-loved OST's. It is hard to move on. Nothing can beat this drama.",10
East Asia,"From the beginning to the end, everything feels energized. The making of the drama is very detailed, the script writer makes the audience dive into the story, made curious, but there is an important point that wants to be conveyed to cure mental illness. and the three best players make this drama very loved. congrats for the good drama ever.",10
East Asia,One of the best masterpiece. Not even missed a single moment of seeing it. Its very interesting story. Great acting by lead roles as well as support roles persons. One of the best i ever seen .,10
East Asia,"A couple of really good kissing scenes that aren't as conservative as most k-dramas.
Storyline is unique and there are a lot of powerful hidden messages.
The only let down for me was that the 'twist' and 'culprit' reveal was short lived, it felt like the build up was highly anticipated but then it was all over in minutes.
The main actor Kim Soo-Hyun was very good in this series, i didn't like him in ""My Love from the Star"" (as he seemed insignificant and overshadowed by the lead actress) but in this drama his acting was very memorable. The supporting actors were also very well portrayed especially the brother with autism, excellent acting from Oh Jung-se.
Overall, a must-watch drama filled with a captivating storyline, powerful life messages, and sweet romance with great kissing.",9
East Asia,"This has got to be the most overrated kdrama ever. It's okay but definitely not better than other kdramas that have lower ratings like Crash Landing On You, Descendants of the Sun and Guardian: The Lonely and Great God (Goblin). It glamorizes mental illness, condones sexual harassment, has hammed acting and an unbelievable storyline for a villain.",7
East Asia,"Absolutely love this drama!! Each and every episode was a masterpiece !!
The plot.. story line.. the cast.. the acting omg.. the dresses
Everything was so so perfect !!
Absolutely must watch drama !!
Straight up perfection !",10
East Asia,In my opinion the direction and character development is one of the best that I have seen. I just didn't want it to end.,10
East Asia,"I really loved this show, the acting is great and the storyline is really unique. It's dark but the funny and sweet parts balance it out. I won't give spoilers but I think it ended well. I highly recommend it!!",10
East Asia,"I have watched so many KDramas but this us my first time writing a review for one because I just couldn't stop myself. This drama is a complete masterpiece. I was reluctant at first thinking that it would've been a sad melodrama and would have left me crying and sobbing for days, which I didn't want. But I was so wrong! This gives me a kick and life lessons which no other drama could, and this is not those typical KDramas which have a not-so-significant female lead. The female lead is the most powerful, and the male is such a good match for her, a great human being. It tells us how someone can enter our life surprisingly and turning it upside down, making it much better than it was, and your loneliness vanishes. It teaches the importance of love and warmth in our empty lives. Overall, one must give it a go. The acting is terrific, and, you'll remember the kiss forever ;)",10
East Asia,"A MUST Watch... Perfekt couple! The chemistry are inevitable! love story, comedy",10
East Asia,"I don't usually watch foreign work because I'm not a fan of subtitles, but my daughter talked me into this one.
I was hooked after the first episode.
Fantastic writing, gifted acting, incredible insight into the world of mental health.
I HIGHLY recommend this series.",10
East Asia,"I GOT HEALED WATCHING THIS. VISUAL, CINEMATOGRAPHY, OST, 10/10",10
East Asia,"It's an okay drama for me, it's a bit overrated, but is the head nurse really is mun yeong's mother ? how did she survived from the fall and being thrown into the lake ?",5
East Asia,"This is one of those series that leaves a mark on your heart. A moral for each story, a beautiful depiction of what is means to be dependable. The hidden truth behind the weight of mental illnesses. The songs, the stories, the laughs and the sadness. I wouldn't miss it. And I will any day watch it all over again.",9
East Asia,"I don't usually write on here about anything but the unique story, the acting, the characters and every little part of this show made it impossible to not write my appreciation for it.I'm am amazed and In love with this Drama. I don't want to spoil it for anyone who reads this but I needed to just say that anyone that comes across this drama should give it a go. It's honestly the best series I've seen all year and one of the best I've seen ever.",10
East Asia,"Cute show, I'm addicted. Must watch for all :)",10
East Asia,"Look if you are looking for a Kdrama that is gonna be so engaging and compelling that your tempted to keep watching from beginning to end straight without breaks this isn't it. The storyline is there but there are also a lot of scenes that are just time filler.Basically most of the characters in the drama have a troubled past and come together in this hospital. Seo Ye-ji has a slightly annoying yet bearable because of her stunning appearance character. Soo-Hyun's character is the best part because he is pretty normal and balanced and Oh Jung-Se acts superbly well for his role but the character he plays can be a little frustrating. You need to be patient with this Drama because some parts can be outright boring.As far as the screenplay and the visuals its awesome. The dialogues are pretty good, nothing crazy but some memorable messages. There is hardly any action and very little comedic relief.This drama is definitely darker, creepy, and on a more serious note than your typically kdrama. If your into that type of stuff you'll like this. If you like a fast pace, lovey-dovey, hilarious drama you are not gonna like this one that much. There is a love story but its very calculated and mature.The drama is good really only in the beginning 5 episodes and the last 4 episodes. It really picks up at the end.I might sound a little critical but I don't really see why everybody is acting like this is the greatest drama ever. yes it has a good message on overcoming the past and facing obstacles and so on but from an entertainment perspective I wish it was a little better.",7
East Asia,This is THE drama that got me so hooked that it was the first K-drama I watched in years. Seo Ye Ji's and Kim Soo Hyun's acting are phenomenal. Watching the show is a given! It has a plot that is like no other drama.,10
East Asia,"Excellent drama,perfect portrayal of characters,very good script,excellent cast and crew.director and writer are well coordinated.overall perfect",10
East Asia,"This show is magical. It's not something that you would witness before. It will keep you hooked from the beginning till the end. And will make you want to re-watch again and again. Instead of skipping, you will be rewinding to watch a scene to hang on to every word of the dialogue, every eye movement, and every small detail. Even the soundtrack is hauntingly beautiful.This show addresses autism, alcoholism, anti social disorder, depression, being lonely and a lot of other mental health issues and finally will give you comfort and closure. This human healing drama is not just about its main characters, every single character has their own story and you will watch it again and again to focus on each of them, to watch their story unravel, to live through their pain, to witness how they overcome these difficulties and rise up like a beautiful butterfly.",10
East Asia,One and only kdrama that gives not only inspiration but also a healing,10
East Asia,"This is my very first K-Drama that I have watched after Full House (that aired at least a decade ago). So, I was able to watch this with a fresh mind, with no expectations. I didn't know who the leads were, having not watched any K-Drama/ movie before therefore, I guess I can write an unbiased review as I am impartial to any of ""fandoms"".
I initially watched this because there was nothing else to watch in Netflix. This kept on getting suggested to me and I gave in. What I didn't know was that it would turn out to be one of the BEST dramas I've ever watched!Where to begin?
The cast: The whole cast (not just the leads) are quite talented. I believe that each and every cast member helped to breath life to their characters. It was as if I was looking into lives of real people with real emotions who have had their own live problems and are trying to overcome them by leaning on each other.The lead characters were exceptional. Especially the actor who played the character of the brother with autism. I have a cousin sister with autism and I was amazed at how accurate his portrayal was. For many episodes I actually believed it was a real person with autism not just an actor doing a great job!
Moving on to the main couple, Ko Moon Young, the female lead with anti personal disorder (I believe she was misdiagnosed), is one of a kind character. At first she is rude, obnoxious, and borderline obsessive. It is quite easy to dislike such a character. But, the actress pulled this difficult task with elegance, style and grace that you can't help but fall in love with her even before the male lead would. She has the best character arc in the show going on to become the most lovable and warm character at the end.
I found the male lead to be quite normal when compared to the other two, however, he is not always likeable. He has his faults, he is not a knight in shining armor, he too makes mistakes and sometimes does not even correct them just like a typical human being would do. It was a realistic portrayal of a man being pressured to take care of his brother with autism all his life, sacrificing all his needs. We see the story from his perspective.The Story/ Writing: I should say the writer and the team has paid attention to every small detail of the story. The way things connect just marveled me. The dialogues are not cheesy or unrealistic. It's quite thoughtful and meaningful and though provoking. There are many relatable quotes that you can take away from this show.
Also, there are few books that were written by the scriptwriter her self! These books, if you get your hands on them, are great as well. Each book contains a children's story that is acting as a cry for help from Ko Moong Young. You will see each story's significance when you watch this drama.Directing: I believe the director and the production team has paid attention to every small angle, lighting, view and even every breath by actors! It is quite exceptional how magical some scenes were!Soundtrack: It is hauntingly beautiful and funny when it needs to be. I loved every OSTOverall Verdict: Highly recommended.",10
East Asia,"I am a male American, used to American movies, dialect, and character plots, but never in my life have I seen an actress with a steaming sexuality as Ye-ji Seo's character. I would see her as Eve in the garden.My wife and I thoroughly enjoy Kdramas, but with this one I should keep my comments to myself.I really appreciate Kdramas that are not about silly youthfulness, and trading characters, or yet traveling into time. That is an over used plot line that cannot go further, but this drama, being a suspenseful, somewhat erotic in a safe nature, and well acted, fits my love for the Korean film industry.The actors of both the protagonist and his autistic brother has a feel of real brotherhood and compassion. A word that does not any longer fit our lexicon. Refreshing to see.Watch it!",10
East Asia,"With everything that is happening this year, this show is what everyone needed. It is the most comforting and satisfying drama I watched, be it Asian or Western. The main trio's characters are perfectly portrayed and their chemistry and acting are top notch. I'm truly impressed!",10
East Asia,It's such a great drama. Different but splendid. I totally love it.,10
East Asia,This was probably the best drama i've ever watched!! I've watched it 3 times now and I will watch it many more times. The cast here is really something. They perform on this drama soo good. You can practically feel every emotion they send to us. I love it and I highly recommend this drama to everyone.,10
East Asia,"Just amazing!! Great acting, character development everything is just perfect",10
East Asia,"Thank you to this drama series, i hv learn a lot, how to not judge based on people appearance, how importance love and warmth is. Thank you for those beautiful journey that you have shown to us.",10
East Asia,"I love it, watch it, then you know. You will experience a lot of emotions through this drama. The 2020 best drama for me.",10
East Asia,"Full of good words.
I like all ost from this drama.
Top tier acting from all the cast.
I like how they portray the development of each character from this drama.
Overall, the best.",10
East Asia,"Master piece.
Kim soo hyun's acting is amazing
Storyline is so good
Moon young beautiful
Sang tae cool",10
East Asia,"I rarely watch on-going dramas but this drama is too good from the first episode.
really recommend everyone to watch.
all the casts are perfect- Oh Jung Se really potrayed Sang Tae well that it makes me think he really have an autism irl haha
Seo Yeaji no doubt, been following her for so long and she did very well potraying mun yeong. you can feel all the pain through her eyes. she cried, i cried. bascially, they cried, i cried.
Kim soo hyun, this is the best character of him, for me. This is the most matured character he played and i really love kang tae.plot wise, kuddos! seriously, worth watching and worth my 10 stars!!",10
East Asia,"The story, soundtrack, location, character back stories and character development are all great! my heart will always remember this kdrama because of how it made me feel. the final episode was amazing, that's one of the kdrama ending that i really liked because I've seen the characters happy, unlike other kdrama ending where i wanted to see more.. with ""its okay not to be okay"" it was very satisfying, there's closure, it made me cry and smile at the same time. i will never forget that last scene of Munyeong, Gangtae and Sangtae.",10
East Asia,"The story revolves around a hard-working man named Kang Tae whose older brother has autism, and Kang Tae alone has to solve his older brother's problems and sufferings, and at the same time make a living.All the problems, in addition to the memory of the murder of a mother who makes her brother nervous, go hand in hand so that Kang Tae's character dedicates his whole life to his only property, his brother.In this muon, Kang Tae meets the beloved writer of his brother, Kang Muyung, who is a bold, reckless woman with strange and exaggerated thoughts and exaggeration.In the first place, the strange relationship between Kang Tae and Muyung comes to the viewer's eyes, and this is where the story begins. Muyong is looking to take over Kang Tae because Kang Tae, unlike other men, stands in front of him and is an interesting creature for Muyong .Screenplay process:The story begins with a fantasy theme. Storytelling whose stories are contrary to the usual narrative process. Old myths such as Cinderella and Snow White and all the old classic stories that have long conveyed a message of goodness and love to the reader, are completely questioned. He looks at them from another angle, and it is interesting that the viewer realizes that yes, he can look at the stories from both positive and negative points, and we ask ourselves really why he has ever looked at this story from this aspect. We did not look, and basically, why is this instrumental and clichéd look repeated from the past to the present?The words that Muyung says in all honesty and sincerity are scary for the viewer. Because the beautiful world changes and changes our childhood dreams.Kang Tae, on the other hand, is a man who constantly runs away from Muyung because he has his brother's problem. His life is hard enough and he gets involved with Muyong and the past that is hard in his mind and for this reason he starts to run away, but Muyong knows Kang Tae is an interesting creature that he wants to get to tempt him. To control his unbridled thoughts and minds.Character buildingA series in every sense of the word. Because the characters had exactly all the details and points they should have. Muyong has a scary past and his father intended to kill him as a child. On the other hand, he saw the murder of his mother and lived in a strange place and strange thoughts were transmitted to him and made him a strange unrestrained woman. Someone who only pursues his childish desires. Kang ta is one of these desires.Unlike Muyung, Kang Tae is a very simple man who even has repetitive clothes that do not fit him at all and only involve his brother's problems.On the other hand, we have the autistic character of Kang Tae's brother, a man who witnessed the murder of his mother as a child, and this has caused him to show signs of panic and nervous movements by seeing signs.These three main characters guide the story well.positive pointsI think it was one of the brainstorming stories that came out recently. I liked the idea behind the story. Two different characters, like two sides of the same coin, who unfortunately both had some kind of mental and subcutaneous problems, and these problems had made their lives difficult.Muyung is an unbridled girl who was raised as a child with high self-confidence. Being superior and on the other hand being obedient to her mother had made a strange potion that this character appeared every time with an accident. This woman has an exaggerated and special behavior from head to toe. That all signs of inner personality. Well done to the author. At the beginning of the story, I thought that the director had just given Cinderella-like clothes and strange make-up and haircuts to Muyong to show her beauty, but the further I went, the more I realized the director's trick. The director has shown high self-confidence and lack of attention to Muyong. On the other hand, because he did not like her as a child, he does not have normal social behavior. Do not worry about the discomfort of those around you and be frank. And Jon, a mother with a mental illness, had strange thoughts surrounding him. Interestingly, this character has used this weakness and now he has become famous and rich. Now, in the midst of all this, he is facing Kang Tae.Kang Tae was also a man who grew up with a bitter reality as a child. ""You were born to take care of your brother."" And this case has involved Katg Teh all his life and made him a very self-sacrificing man who, if he wants to take a step away from this sacrifice, will suffer a pang of conscience. And this character is now acquainted with Muyong.Screenplay process:The story had good skeleton and skeleton and had a good theme and plot. The part where the author creates stories as Muyung was very interesting to me. Different from all the children's stories I have ever read. Each had a different message, and these messages were clearly visible in the text of the story.Like the story of a mother who does all the work for her child and when she asks the child to walk and do something, she sees that the child has neither hands nor feet. This was one of the most meaningful stories I have ever read. The concept of beauty means that we must allow children to explore the world on their own.Or the story of a child who ate meat. The first mother starts giving meat to the animals of the village and sacrifices her hands and feet when there is nothing left. But he sees that the child only wanted a warmth of love from his mother.Congratulations to the author on the stories being extremely amazing. A concept from Muyong's past life in which his mother played a major role.The illustration space was very rough. That cursed castle with that basement or sanatorium is not a problem. Well, it has a good reference to the name of the story.I also liked the humor of the work, despite the fact that it has sharp and bitter parts, but it had interesting humor, such as Kang wearing a suit and Muyung making him jealousThe actors were extremely good at portraying the story very well. Especially Kang Tae's brother, who played the role of an autistic man well.The music of the work, except for one OST, I liked the rest of the design and it sounded goodExcellent directing and editing. I loved editing the work immensely.The episodes that were cut were attractive to the viewer or the combination of animation with the story gave an imaginative and dreamy atmosphere to the story space that did not bother the viewer in any way.end of the storyI would prefer that both characters be completely cured. That the characters become good with love is nothing more than a myth, and some of the psychological problems that have their roots in people's childhood are not easily solved with love. Even if it is solved for a short time, it still shows itself after a deeper period than before.But in general, because the series was fantasy and sweet, I reject this point as a sub-syllable.In the end, I will gladly give this series a score of nine and a half, and I will definitely recommend it to almost everyone as a good psychological series.",10
East Asia,I've never written a review before but this drama needed a review. The way this drama was written and filmed was so unique. The acting of the cast is so amazing. No random side stories that have nothing to do with the whole story. Any side stories parallel with the main story. It is a fairy tail but a dark fairy tale and I loved it.,10
East Asia,"Great title BTW, which never hurts. It's also the official slogan for OK Psychiatric Hospital, a facility by the ocean where Gang Tae ( Kim Soo Hyun ) is a caregiver. He lives with/cares for his older, autistic brother Sang Tae ( Oh Jung Se ) until an eccentric, anti-social author of dark children's books called Moon Young ( Seo Ye Ji ) crashes into their lives.
This is a good, sometimes very good series which doesn't reach the exalted heights of my top shelf ( 30 But 17, While You Were Sleeping, Hotel Del Luna, S1 of Welcome To Waikiki ) due to some frustrating script/directing issues.
What they do get right is that critical central relationship. Yes, it's knee-deep in the sort of incestuous ( as in growing up next door to your future girlfriend ) tragedy endemic to K-Drama, yet the characters are vividly drawn & the bumpy progression towards a real ""family"" is a joy to watch. And speaking of vivid, I'm sure every young actress in Korea was chasing the part : it's a juicy role that not only embraces all human emotions but it's also fun. She gets to say whatever she thinks with no thought for consequences, which includes calling out fools where required & abusing anyone in her way. The male lead isn't nearly as colourfully written, yet is handled equally well.
Handled not so well is an alleged relationship between the author's loud-mouthed publisher & a nurse at the hospital. The script lets them down, while his long-suffering assistant ( such a scene-stealer in While You Were Sleeping ) is wasted apart from the very end. I was also dismayed by how the visual fun of the first few eps is abandoned thereafter, though the show does look good in general and a gothic, Tim Burton vibe is noticeable. And kissing ? There's a bit, & there should've been more; early on, SYJ makes some very raunchy comments in public, but the director coyly cops out later & not because SYJ was just wanting attention.
So casting a gorgeous lead pairing is no guarantee of success ( as proven in Backstreet Rookie ), though it works magnificently here & the chemistry sizzles. KSH has more of the dramatic chores to do & is impressive, while the husky-voiced, ultra-charismatic SYJ dominates the screen whenever she appears. OJS as the brother is effective & the boss of the hospital is enjoyably avuncular & ready with a smile when there's chaos all around.
The ending ? So important in my opinion & leaves a sour taste if it's mediocre. The finale here is thankfully satisfying & left me in tears.",8
East Asia,I love it becuz of the romance parts and the exciting storyline,9
East Asia,Some of the characters are truly fascinating like the cranky psychiatrist. But the romantic plot was a hoax in itself.,8
East Asia,"This show really hits differently. The story is very special and well delivered. Topics of mental health, trust, friendship and love are brought upon. I really love that we see the perspective of the world from an autistic person. This drama has heavy and heartaching scenes, but also comic, and is pleasant to watch. Solid plot, strong dialogue, exceptional cinematography and visuals, professional acting and great chemistry, and beautiful soundtrack.
Highly recommended show!",10
East Asia,"In the beginning it was bit scary. And then i become intrigued of the story of the writer and so with the caregiver. Their story resembles alot in real life situation. I cant find the answer to my questions in real life, their story can give you a boost and hint. Thumbs up. I had watched them twice in a row. ??????",10
East Asia,My own opinion this is the best kdrama i have ever watched for this year... or for the whole decade,10
East Asia,"Best drama for me next to The Queen's Gambit :) love the plot, cinematography, the actors and their acting are superb!",10
East Asia,"This is a mix drama of romance,fun and little horrifying things .
Go ahead watch this ????",9
East Asia,"This is the first time I'm writing a review and man I just can't stop myself from writing one.
This show is literally a MASTERPIECE. Each episode is awesome in its own way. The actors/actresses, storyline, soundtracks, emotions everything are just amazing. A must watch show!!!",10
East Asia,"Of all dramas i have watched so far, this tops the list for now. All the actors including the side actors and not only the main actors have completely justified their roles. The way of illustrating emotions through books was beautifully shown. A must watch! Lot's of love to the team for creating a master piece!!!",10
East Asia,I must visit south Korea someday. Excellent cinematography and a matching Storyline.After the world of the married and now it's okay not to be okay..,10
East Asia,"This was the first kdrama i watched and i was completely pleased. The story and the characters were written and portrayed so well, and all the cast members had the best chemistry so it was amazing and i got really attached to it. And i have been craving a second season ever since. 1 is not enough.",10
East Asia,"This is hands down, the best K-Drama that I've watched so far. It takes you on a roller coaster of emotions from having you laughing till you can't breath to sobbing and blowing your nostrils into mountains of tissues. Not many people can say that a tv show can help change your view on life but I truly can say that this drama has. It teaches life lessons and portrays hardships that people go through in such a soulful and ethereal manner that it leaves you starstruck. All in all, even if you've never watched Korean dramas, this is the type of drama that everyone can enjoy with their friends and family.",9
East Asia,"It reminds me of wizard of oz. The OST music, lighting, way it's filmed, acting, character development was superb. The topic of unrequited love, jealously, anger, resentment, loneliness, lost of love ones, ptsd, guilt and a bunch of other emotions. The actors perfected portray the characters.",10
East Asia,"This is my favorite drama of all time. I love all of the characters inside, except for the villain. Love the couple, also his brother. This is a must-watched drama. The healing side of this drama healed me a lot. The development of the characters made my heart fluttered. This drama is so amazing, not like the other romantic dramas with the cheesy moment. The romance gave me the tension of the real couple. Hard for me to move on from this drama.",10
East Asia,"Love this drama a lot since the first episode. Love for the characters Ko Moon Young, Moon Gang Tae, and Moon Sang Tae, our three main leads. Love the romance side, also love the sibling's side.",10
East Asia,"The intro is good, but I didn't find the first episode interesting as a whole. The camera shots were awesome as well as the transitions. What I like about the series is the way the female lead expresses her thoughts implicitly. The children stories laid out for each episode also contributed in making this series better. This drama also let you see the two sides of a story as well as the characters. All characters are flawed and made beautifully. A suggestion for improvement is to lessen the dull moments and fill each episode with more happenings. It was ended well though, I really like it. The female lead is also funny especially in episode 9.",7
East Asia,"I watched this drama more than 20 times (looks really toxic indeed), but I like it more, never get bored. After watching it over and over again, I realized that even the small details in this drama have a very deep meaning. This drama changed my perspective, the way I saw the world.I also have a brother with autism and as a child I often felt that my parents treated me unfairly, I was considered like the wind in the family. But through this drama, I recovered, my pain slowly disappeared.For people who think this drama is boring. I don't think they know what ""empathy"" means. understanding this drama requires a very high level of empathy, and a very deep analysis.This drama has many profound meanings. It is true as the saying goes, only those who suffer will understand what suffering is. Thank you for bringing this beautiful drama into my life. I love this so much. I will never forget it.",10
East Asia,"Since there are already so many glowing comments about this show, I won't go into detail on how incredible I thought it was in every possible way. Suffice to say, I couldn't tear my heart or my eyes away. Zero cliches, a deep story with complex, non-standard characters, delivered by compelling performances from the whole cast. Even the ending (where many KDramas tend to come apart or fade away) was beautiful, tightly written and satisfying. Truly KDrama at it's finest. Don't be put off by the uninspiring synopsis on Netflix and just watch it. You won't be sorry.ROMANCE RATING: 8/10 * * *There were only ~3 kiss scenes, however the ones that we got were romantic and passionate, with sizzling chemistry between the lead characters. Viewers are also treated to a few unexpected fan service shots, courtesy of Kim Soo-Hyun's impressive torso and washboard abs.",10
East Asia,"I love about this series is the overall story. Casts are stunning and perfectly fit to the character they portraits. The cinematography, acting, settings, and story that you can really relate to. I recommend this series a 100% must watch.",10
East Asia,"Anyone who haven't watched this series yet? Then you must right now. I'm speechless actually. Everything I have been expecting in numerous series / dramas I've watched and known, this ""It's Okay to Not Be Okay"" K-Drama is the answer. HAHA. The casts, genre, story, ""everything"" was made me addicted to it.",10
East Asia,"Out of all the shows I've watched, this has left me with the worst post-drama depression ever. I can't describe or understand why exactly I am so invested in the characters, ESPECIALLY GANG TAE AND MUN YEONG. Ever since I finished it, my heart aches every time I think about the show. It's like a void that will never be filled, in the most beautiful way possible. I love it so much and I really hope they somehow renew this for another season, although unlikely. The chemistry between the actors kills me, each scene they're together hurts me even if it's a happy one. I loved the magical realism and the little details they put into the plot, which just further enhanced the great acting of all the actors. If you're planning to watch this, I recommend preparing yourself 'cause you're gonna feel empty for a while after finishing it. Try to not miss anything and dedicate your full attention when watching it - that's how you'll enjoy it the most. I don't think I have ever shipped a couple so much, the dynamics and their backstories and the way they healed through each other are just perfect. The tension and the stares during those sweet and intimate scenes are what really pushed me off the edge. And of course, the funniest faces and lines at the most unexpected moments. I am 100% sure that this will probably be my favorite k-drama forever, I got so lost in their world and I find myself going back to it every now and then. I find comfort in them and I've gotten so used to it all. The familiarity you'll develop with the show is the best part of everything. I don't think I'd ever be the same again, I love the way I feel whenever I watch/think about it, it makes me smile and cry at the same time. My greatest wish is for these two to work together on the same project again, even if it's not for a season 2 of IOTNBO.",10
East Asia,"I was looking for something a bit different and stumbled across this. I'd heard about it but had no idea it was a Korean title so ended up being my introduction to Korean TV and really, the review title sums it up, 'just wow'. This was an emotional rollercoaster from episode 1 right through to the very end, the characters really draw you in and make you part of their journey from being so well scripted and well acted by all.Thank you to all involved in this production.",10
East Asia,"2 words: Seo yeji.
I hope that OH JUNG SE Get the reconsideration he deserves, his acting is everything also soo Hyun was a really good gang tae
Everything is letterly an art",10
East Asia,"I don't write reviews. However after seeing so many great reviews I felt like I had to say something. This was the most boring k-drama I have ever watched! Nothing actually happens it's just people talking. I understand how some people are saying ""it has real themes!"" and how great the portrayal of autism was etc etc..
Yes great to see autism being showcased in a series with real themes however based on just the entertainment value of this series I could not continue after episode 11. I was bored several episodes ago but kept on watching waiting for something to happen which nothing did and I just felt like I wasted my time.",2
East Asia,"I didn't want to watch this drama at first. The first episode was quite boring. In the end, I can say this is definitely the best TV series I've watched so far!!! So so powerful, true, it shows different aspects of life in a unique way. I just loved it so much. I even miss every single character because they are so good and I'm so sad I finished this!! If you're looking for something different, true, powerful, well made and even fun, watch this show. It's worth your time!",10
East Asia,This k-drama is amazing! I can't describe its extraordinariness with words. Definitely the best k-drama I've ever watched in my whole life!,10
East Asia,This drama is great only because of the acting of Oh Jung-Se / Moon Sang- and the wardrobe of Ko Mun-Yeong / Seo Ye-Ji.,5
East Asia,"This was my first time watching a Korean drama and I have to say I am very glad I did. The cinematography is simply stunning, and the parts were all played very well. Definitely worth a watch.",9
East Asia,"I loved everything in this series, the cast, the story, the direction, the ending, the main character's chemistry
It's my new favorite KDrama!
I give it 200/10",10
East Asia,"I'm not even finished yet; I think I have like 3 episodes left till the end, but I really wanted to go ahead rate this already to express just how much I LOVE this drama right now!!! ???????????? It's pretty addicting too!",10
East Asia,I'm new to korean drama's and this one is the best tv series i have ever seen.,10
East Asia,"Story is epic. Each and every episode is fascinating and engaging as to what will happen next.
Songs are so good that i downloaded all the songs right away.
Cast is superb, great acting by Kim Soo Hyun , Seo Yea Ji and Oh Jung Sae .
Saranghae to the show and especially Kim Soo Hyun ?",10
East Asia,LOVE THIS DRAMA OMG???? love Gang Tae and Munyeong,10
East Asia,"I shed tears unabashly during the last episode. This K-drama certainly outshine everyone. To be fair, each K-drama has it's own merit, be it Rom-com, thriller action etc. But this one dares to be different. From the acting, which is superb, every character is so well portrayed by the actor you are instantly drawn into their lives, you share with them their pain, joy... their ups and downs. praise to the Director, the script writer and everyone involved in making this awesome story. K-drama has come of age. Spinning a story of mental health, coupling with love, fears, weakness of human nature is no means feat.
If you watched K-dramas before, you will enjoy this one. I have no reservation recommending you watch this one. If you never watch another K movie this is the one not to miss. Enjoy. You can thank me later.",10
East Asia,"What a captivating story filled with excellent acting and cinematography that made me, a 23 year old man, cry wholeheartedly many times both out of sadness and happiness.
I genuinely cannot nitpick even a single thing that could've been done better, I loved it all and was glued to the screen for the past few days.",10
East Asia,"What I liked
1. A merge between fairytale and real-life themed storyline
2. Major character arc
3. Cinematography
4. Realistic portrayal of struggle with emotions and mental health
5. Brilliant acting and dialoguesWhat I didn't like.
1. Acceptance of toxic behaviourThis show has encaptured all possible emotions in a box and sprinkled it across the storyline like fairy dust. I can't get enough of how beautifully the story evolves. This show is not just about romance, it's about-
1. Strong family bonds with people irrespective of bloodlines.
2. How our childhood experiences or the past, both haunts and keeps us alive.
3. People with mental illness are humans too, they need extra strength to come out of the box
4. We don't belong to others, we belong to ourselves
5. Human beings are weak so we should lean on each other to become invincible.
6. Butterfly means psyche, some may see it as madness, and some- cure.
There are numerous little reminders like this throughout the show.
I also loved how the creators gave us a complete picture of the story that will proceed after the show ends. That's some next-level passion for storytelling.Along with this, I want to point out Ko-mun-Yeong's toxic behaviour towards Gung-tae. I understand her pain and her behaviour, but I sometimes felt her controlling behaviour was accepted and barely addressed. Even in the end, her controlling behaviour is just joked about. No matter how much love exists in a relationship, that level of need to control your partner is never okay.This show will always be in my memories- the honesty of this show is one of a kind.",9
East Asia,"Each character is unique and clever. The acting is superb especially Kim soo hyun portray moon gang tae character is amazing. This drama is funny yet heartbreaking, I also cried and laughed at every episode. Overall, this drama is worth watching.",10
East Asia,"Wow. What an outstanding drama, and one I am so so sad to have finished. The acting, the music, the story, the atmosphere - everything just worked so well, and it quickly became one of those 'ach we'll just squeeze in one more episode' shows that my partner and I watch (despite each episode being roughly 1 hour 20!). I ended up getting so attached to each character, and their individual stories, and thought that the way this programme handled mental health was so beautifully done. The acting was excellent from all, but especially from the actor who played Sang-tae (Oh Jung-se) - his acting was nothing short of phenomenal. I only wish I was watching this magical piece of art for the first time again.",10
East Asia,"Beautifully written, the actors were great, the storyline was excellent. I loved the unique take it had on fairy tale stories. It was a masterpiece loved it as much as kill me Heal me",10
East Asia,"A heart touching series that i love.. You need to be patient for the first episode, but later on it goes best",10
East Asia,"This show is absolutely amazing. The message that the title alone sends is inspiring, and by the time the rollercoaster is over you will be pumping the brakes wishing the ride would never end. I really loved the music, and the atmosphere they had throughout the show. It was quite mesmerizing and even hypnotic at times. The fact that the actor and actress actually had the disorders they were portraying brought an incredible level of authenticity to their performance, and that authenticity really carried the story well from beginning to end. It is a very layered and complex story with many well developed characters. It will definitely leave you deeply moved with an inspiration to grow in your own life.",10
East Asia,Beautiful! Amazing! Wow! Just Wow! I have no words to describe this drama. Every episode is better then the one before. I really loved it.,10
East Asia,The acting in this series is out of this world. The character development is perfect and realistic. Beautiful cinematography. Amazing supporting characters. If I was to look for a weakness it would have to be that the plot might be a little bit too complicated. The characters and acting alone could carry this show and some conflicts are unnecessary. Overall it is the best show I've ever watched. It is very close to perfect.,10
East Asia,"I had a little bit of a hard time connecting in the first few episodes because I had no idea what I was watching to be honest!! LOL! But trust me when I say that this series takes a complete 360 and becomes something completely captivating. An emotional, thrilling, heart warming ride! I was not expecting this series to become what it did. Such an amazing and wonderful series. Full of so much story, heart, emotion, trauma including childhood trauma, friendship, romance, family etc. The 3 main characters just grab your heart and never let go. The whole cast is amazing really! Give this one a shot if you love Korean dramas!",10
East Asia,"I do not know how to describe my feeling now, i just wish the story will never end. Love the couple and the reserve characteristic for both the main role. Feeling so unacceptable for the drama has already ended that quick. (sob)(sob)",10
East Asia,"It contains lots of msgs.. For daily life..
& It's completely different from the typical k-drama /C-dram Or any other series... ??
Highly recommend...
I can assure ....you won't regret",10
East Asia,I love this show Is Have not watched something like this before.... Misterious... Funny... Awesome...,10
East Asia,"I don't know where to start. I've never written a review to begin with, and I've seen a lot of shows. This was my first introduction to kdrama. And what a beautiful and emotional ride it was. The story is wonderful and tragic at the same time. And what a brilliant preformance from all of the actors. I've never seen a show quite like this and I can't stop thinking about it. Everyone should see it - it touches some heavy topics in a brilliant way. It is absolutely one of my top dramas I've ever seen, and let me tell you, that says a lot. If you haven't seen it - do it. You won't be dissapointed!!",9
East Asia,"After watching this, i have a hard time finding anything that can live up to the exitement, and quality of this k-drama. I am no film-expert but i have never seen anything with that level of personal development.",10
East Asia,"It's not the romance that's most captivating about this story, but the way they all struggle with their own demons(hardships), and understand each other, because they know what pain feels like. It's just so real and so raw, that you see the pain they go through, and you feel every emotion, strongly.It really exposes us to how people can look so perfect, so successful, but be hurting on the inside, and it takes strong people, that are forced to grow up quickly, that know how to survive, but lack the one thing that makes them difficult to be understood from the rest: normalcy. You see these characters develop a loving-something they've long to feel-relationship with one another. How they come together and lift each other up, not realizing how much their strengths and weaknesses help one another, is just, unforgettable. What a lovely, impactful, love story-with all 3 members.",10
East Asia,Such a wonderful series. Artistic and emotional and surprising! Addictive!!,10
East Asia,Best korean drama ... I have ever seen...I love it,10
East Asia,Story is very nice i love the character of ko moon young.,10
East Asia,Well i am a huge fan of romance genre but only quality series of movie. So i watch very little romance but i see something different and memorable. This series is so beautiful and lovely i almost cried while watching it and i didn't wanted it to get over. It is perfectly balanced and perfectly casted series. It surpasses my expectations and i am totally in love with the series along with the cast which i love and will miss... lots of love to the team,10
East Asia,Beautiful- sadness- loneliness- creative- dark- heartbreaking- mysterious- romance- disorders- happiness- friendship- horror- and much more. A good watch. It will not disappoint you. I loved it !,10
East Asia,"I don't even know how many times I watched this series over and over because I couldn't quite get over it. The storyline, cinematography, and the cast is quite unmatched, as it also emphasises several mental health issues. 10000000/10",10
East Asia,"Simply , This is a wonderful family Drama. I have seen a lot of dramas including Korean dramas. Usually Korean dramas are cheesy, funny, exciting and romantic. There is usually a bad person at the top of the chain and finally the good wins. But this is like no other. Every single episode was unbelievable. specially the first 4 episodes. I am going to watch this again as this drama can actually teach you many things about life. This is a wonderful drama which must be recognized and watched universally. Bravo. from a Sri Lankan Biritish fan.",10
East Asia,Love it so much this show got me back into kdrama its so different just my typeee.,10
East Asia,"A perfect show with everything perfect. Whether it's acting or cinematography or storyline, the show has always gave us a perfect episode. The ending was soo satisfying. I strongly recommend the show to those people who want to watch something extraordinary, in its own way.",10
East Asia,I didn't like the first episode but after that I was captivated for this show. Superb acting by Oh Jeong and Kim Soo. I hope both won awards for leading and supporting role. Very well done!,9
East Asia,"This is one of my favourite series! One of the best Korean series that I would recommend.I honestly watch this series because Seo Yeji or Ko Munyoung in this series. I really love her cute face and her deep voice. I hoped she would get more main role in series. And yes!! She got a very nice one.Since they got very famous actors and actress, I really expect it to be fun. The trailer is interesting enough to catch me. I decided to watch it by not wait until the series end. I usually watch all episodes at once. But this series made me waiting for the new episode every week.I didn't expect such a good art work. The footages and montages are really wow for me. Creative team of this series have done a very good job. First few episodes really catch me with good editing. Farther episodes, I focused on the plots that getting more intense. The opening animation is very nice. I just love it. I also like some songs in this series.The characters of Mun Sungtae, Mun Kangtae, and Ko Munyoung are very interesting and new for me. I like the story behide their characters. I really pride Mun Sangtae acting skills. He killed it!The plot is very interesting for me. I want to know more and more about their story. I like many Ko Munyoung 's books. All drawing in Ko Munyoung books is nice and have characters. I want to follow the artist of that drawing. The story she wrote have hidden meaning and moral that really touched me.This series is quite drama but they also have funny parts and romantic parts. The funny parts are real fun. That is my vibes. They also got very nice costumes for all characters. The costumes support the characters really well. Ko Munyoung make up is very suit her. It was so great.For someone who haven't watched it yet, I highly recommend this series if you usually like Korean series.",10
East Asia,"Ko Moon Young is one of the powerful female lead i've ever seen! Although, she is psycho, but that's okay , she showed us the well character development through each episodes which have a children's book fairytales. Beside Ko Moon Young, i really appreciate that each episodes always have taught me something good in life. Well, Moon Gang Tae's character is well paired with Ko Moon Young, their chemistry is really really good! Meanwhile, Moon Sang Tae is the character that i cared the most. Well, this is a good drama. But, sorry, i can not give 10/10 because of the ending, i do think the whole story ends at episode 15. When i watch episode 16, I don't have the things to be curious on because all of the things have been cleared on episode 15.",9
East Asia,"I think that the actings are soo amazing.
It was really emotional in some parts and I really like it overall
Highly recommended",10
East Asia,"Two mentally ill people - a man who thinks of everyone but himself and a woman who thinks of no-one but herself - teach each other to function as normal human beings. It's a moving love story.Such an interesting premise, which the actors make entirely believable. However, the acting honours go to Oh Jeong-Se, playing an autistic brother, who stole every scene in which he appeared.This series is well worth watching and highly recommended. It is almost as good as Mr Sunshine and Crash Landing on You, which are also from Korea and are the two best TV series I have seen in years.",9
East Asia,"I really love Korean dramas. But this has to be one of the best! The main characters are just great. You almost fall in love with them. The story is very well written, and it conveys a clear message! You have to watch this 1000% for sure.",9
East Asia,"It was aesthetically pleasing and well acted. But Oh my god OVER-DRAMATISATION of literally EVERYTHING. Couldn't related to anything or anyone, nothing was believable (except the portrayal of autism). Couldn't even finish",5
East Asia,Loved the engaging story and the chemistry between main leads. The performance of both the leads was outstanding.,10
East Asia,"Omg!!! What a masterpiece, just beautiful. Fun, emotional, heartfelt, self-finding, never underestimate the power of LOVE and the meaning of true HAPPINESS. NOW PLEASE STOP READING AND START WATCHING.",10
East Asia,"I ended up binge watching this in one weekend. The chemistry between Seo YeJi and Kim Soo Hyun seemed so natural and you hope they find love with each other. Their lives along was Oh Jeong Se was intertwined with terror, heartbreak and loss of a childhood. Superb acting along with beautiful scenery kept the viewer entertained throughout the series. Will definitely be watching it a few times.
Hope there is a part 2!",10
East Asia,"I've never written a review before, and I have watched so many titles that I haven't even finished rating them yet. But this series is so unique that I had to put it in writing just to help myself remember how it felt the first time I saw it.Everything about this series is enchanting. The story, the characters, the script, the set, their clothes, the music, everything. Not an episode passed by without crying my eyes out, some happy tears, some sad. I don't want to spoil it for anyone, so I will let you experience it on your own. Please clear up your mind when watching it and embrace the possibility that it's always okay not to be okay. Do not be embarrassed to show your feelings, take off your mask and feel everything at once or nothing at all.This series will forever hold a place in my heart and I promise to myself that every time I feel separated from the world I will re-watch it. Hopefully I will forget everything about it so I can watch it all over again. Enjoy!",10
East Asia,"10/10 is my rating. This is a 2020 South Korean Romantic Drama television Series with 16, 70-85 minute episodes. Alternate title is ""Psycho but It's ok.""Moon Gang-tae (Kim Soo-hyun) and Moon Sang-tae (Oh Jung-se) are two brothers who have lived a difficult and unsettled life trying to outrun the horror of their past. Gang-tae is the younger brother but was told before his mother's untimely death that he should take care of his autistic older brother. who has autism. Sang-tae is the older brother but significant autism leads him to being child like, innocent and honest to a fault. As a younger child, Sang-tae witnessed his mother's murder which left him traumatized and, for some reason, terrified of butterflies. Gang-Tae is a care giver in psychiatric wards and has been able to move from hospital to hospital as they move around. at every place they settle in. Ko Moon-young (Seo Yea-ji), writes dark fairy tales which are inspired by horrific events in her past and an overbearing and abusive mother. She is invited to teach at the psychiatric ward because her books have special appeal for those struggling with their own psychological demons. Circumstances lead the three to the town where they all grew up and when their paths overlap Moon-young is drawn to the quiet compassionate and devastatingly handsome Gae-tae. Moon-young is extremely beautiful but unapproachable as some have indicated she has antisocial personality disorder. Those who irritate or seek to harm Moon-young are likely rto experience her wrath and her manager spends significant time and money cleaning up Moon-young's many social blunders. What Moon-young wants she usually gets and she begins to relentlessly pursue Gang-tae. The two seem like oil and water but are actually more like ying and yang. Can they solve the mysteries of the past and grow a love pure enough to heal both?I am really glad it is ok to not be ok because I certainly wasn't when this ended. I so loved the main characters that letting it go was like leaving old friends. It was such a wonderful and masterful story that was a little like ""The Adam's Family"", ""Rainman"", dark fairy tales, and A Series of Unfortunate Events"" mixed together and birthed something with elements from all yet uniquely its own. The backdrop of the mental hospital was fascinating because there were patients struggling with a wide range of mental health challenges. The honesty, compassion and courage the disorders were presented with spoke strongly to the message that we do not always have to be okay. The two brothers and the way they had their weaknesses yet leaned on each other through a rough and lonely childhood as orphans was very heart warming. Moon-young proved to be a lot less heartless than her exterior portrayed and was the missing key for the duo to become a trio and develop into a true family. The acting was amazing and the music, costume and sets were beautiful. I will watch this again and highly recommend this wonderful series. I would not change a single thing.",10
East Asia,"After watching this web show i am so amazed how can k drama made this fantastic shows .

Congratulations to the Director for directing this Beautiful Show and All Cast and Crew who were there in the making of this exceptional Show.
A must watch Family Drama.",10
East Asia,Believe me..... Just watch it... I don't want to spoile anything regarding this kdrama.It's so awsome so awsome that no other Serie or kdrama can replace it's story... And I also loved the whole cast of this series specially the lead heroine ? .It's one in a life time experience... Story Of a creepy world of different people turning into a real Measmarising fairy tail.,10
East Asia,"This series is great...all which may be story line, background music,screenplay all are fantastic..though I watched in hindi dubbed...all characters are very unique and so sophisticated and well experienced. I also like the character of director of ok hospital....lead actress and actor are very charismatic personality..fall in love with them.",10
East Asia,"I like this series really, well in first episode I find out that this series is very HYPE but after watching some episodes I found it one of the great series. I liked most Ko moon Yeon character, it's not irritating during the show apart I liked it most. I hope after you watched this series you liked this series very well. Also both brothers are acted well.",10
East Asia,"Came for romance. Stayed for an amazing acting perfomance by Oh Jung Se, in his portrayal of Moon Sang-tae.",6
East Asia,"Let me start by saying this is an excellent acted psychological drama/love story, with the main protagonists scarred by events or situations they have been in during their life. The main setting is a psychiatric hospital & I will not go into the main storyline details b/c that can be read in a synopsis.I wanted to give this drama an 8 or 9/10, but there is one RIDICULOUS plot twist that I cannot forgive so I've only given it a 6/10.*****SPOILER ALERT******Okay, let us talk about the mom of the daughter still being alive. It really goes off the rails on this ""twist"" in Episode 14. In Episode 13, the mom was shown explicitly being thrown off a 2nd story balcony by her husband & directly landing on the side of her head on the below stairwell. She suffered SEVERE hemorrhaging that would have killed her; but let's say for ""creative license"" sakes she survived this event. She would have had a SEVERE traumatic brain injury & would be eating through a straw the rest of her life! But there is more. Her husband then throws her body that's inside a bag into a cold lake. So basically, she's now dead X 2.But nope, she's been alive the last 20 yrs. & is now the head nurse at the psychiatric hospital! Say what?? It's explained that she looks nothing like her younger version b/c of plastic surgery; and by looking at the difference b/t the 2 mom actors, extensive/multiple plastic surgeries! I don't know how she found time to go to nursing school.If that isn't enough bad writing, it's shows the mom/head nurse helping a patient kill himself that occurs in Episode 1. But there are surveillance cameras in his room. A detective with more than 1 brain cell could look at the surveillance camera to show her helping him commit suicide! But that would have been the end of this drama after 1 episode.To me, this type of writing is an insult to the viewer. I understand in many dramas you must suspend belief to a point. But this ""suspension"" is Friday the 13th Jason type-suspension. And this is not a Friday the 13th type drama. Overall, it is a beautifully written drama showing how 2 scarred individuals fall in love while one grows a soul & the other finds life beyond helping others.My recommendation is to watch this drama but have your favorite hard liquor of choice available in Episode 14..........it might make the ridiculous plot twist go down better.",6
East Asia,"I have been putting watching this drama off for quite some time, now i know why. I needed to learn that nothing will compare to it, and i am a big fan of CLOY and Vagabond. Strong plot, excellent acting performance, scripts, camera, soundrack..
What was interesting is that it made me watched it through the eyes of Moon Gang-tae, i felt what he felt, i laughed when he laughed and cried when he cried.Seo yea-ji was absolutely stunning, her makeup, hair, attire.. i couldnt take my eyes of her. Although her characters started off as a cold and emotionless woman, her warm smile gave her soon away. I was very impressed with how well her character developed throughout the series. I was also pleased to see that her character was equally strong as the male lead. This doesnt often happen even if put in a position of power.Kim Soo-hyun, what is left to say. He is a Mr. Actor. And who have thought that it will be Gang-tae who will have to let go, eh??And of course, lets dont forget to mention Oh Jung-se as the lovable autistic Moon Sang-tae. Amazingly well portrayed.The supporting roles were just as good, all very well complimented each other.For me the best kdrama of all times, a must watch that opens eyes about lives of carers and how they often sacrifice their own lives and happiness for those they care for.",10
East Asia,"Acting was fabulous, particularly the brother with autism. He deserves an Oscar.",8
East Asia,"9.5 ? Rating. This is my 1st Korean Drama. It's takes 2 Episodes to involve in Korean World.It's totally worth watching. Full of Emotions, Comedy, Romance. A perfect Definition of bond between two Brothers.Sang - Tae Steals the Show entirelyWatch 3rd Quarter In one goReview Count 1.",10
East Asia,Very different story line but very moving and easy to binge watch with such amazing actors who were outstanding .... kind of like 'One flew over the cuckoo nest' Korean style ... highly recommend.,10
East Asia,Every one should watch this rollercoster of romance really wonderful experience. Want to see 2 nd season.,10
East Asia,"The story/plot of this drama, as you may already know by now, deals with mental health. Talk about taking risks, this production dared to be different and they delivered! Dark yet refreshing. The story and script was very interesting and provoking. The theme meant to not just entertain but educate and bring awareness on mental, emotional, and psychological issues people can relate to. True to its goal, the drama indeed is a healing drama.Impeccable acting by the 3 lead actors and by all the supporting cast. Everyone did justice to their characters, especially the 3 leads with their complex characters. Obviously, Seo Ye Ji and Oh Jung Se delivered their characters well (I did a little bit of acting in theater in the past and while their characters were challenging, it was much easier to internalize and deliver than that of Moon Gang Tae's). So hats off to Kim Soo Hyun... how could he have pulled off that character well is pure genius!The direction was neither fast nor too slow, just the perfect amount of suspense that viewers need to stay glued and captivated. The production was amazing too. They perfected all the details (costume, lighting, tone, angles and framing, special effects, dialogue, etcetera) and they were able to give the perfect scene setting and atmosphere needed in this type of unorthodox genre. Perfect execution!And as a special bonus, the soundtrack and musical score supported well the overall theme of this drama. Just made watching every scenes beautiful and touching!This is a deviation from the usual and the norm in kdramaland but watching the perfect blend of the technical and sentimental ingredients of this drama is already healing the soul. To say that this drama is a masterpiece is an understatement. I'm giving it 11 stars!",10
East Asia,"Loved it , it will take you to a tour with amazing direction and acting.",10
East Asia,"Overall it was a really good drama, showing us various types of mental illnesses. The part that didn't make sense to me was the arrival of the female lead's mother. How did she survive the fall from the stairs and being thrown into the sea inside a bag hours later?",8
East Asia,"I'm not a K-drama fan, and it's certainly not a typical K-drama. The drama captured me from the very first episode, and I started to wonder the stories of each character. Each character is unique in their own way but realistic at the same time. It's really a healing drama, while the characters are trying to heal themselves by taking power from each other, I felt like their journey was also healing me with its warmth. Besides the great plot, acting is just outstanding. I fell in love with Seo Yea Ji's acting, so pure and natural. She reflects Ko Moon Young's character development so well and she shines through the whole drama like a queen. Kim Soo Hyun is amazing too, and his chemistry with Seo Yea Ji is just off the charts. I haven't watched such a good couple for a long time. Oh Jung Se's acting is awesome too. In addition to all, I loved the cinematography, so neat and elegant. And lastly, it gives really good messages with the its little stories and dialogues are quite well written. OST is great too! I strongly recommend.",10
East Asia,"Acting of all cast is best & Story is mind-blowing & Peaceful. Especially acting of 3 main characters toch my heart respectively
1. Ko Munyong
2. Sang tee
3. Gang tee.",10
East Asia,1 of the best series in lifetime. Total awesomeness...,7
East Asia,This is bestes show of my life i never see this type of show but when i start watching this show i love it very very much i loved this show best show for all really i like it sooooo muchhh...,10
East Asia,"Cinematography is amazing, acting, music, story everything is good about this show.",9
East Asia,There's not many series that make a special place in Audiences heart. But this series one of those which made a special place in our hearts. This series has an amazing and an unique story line. I just love it.,10
East Asia,"I've been exploring K-drama these last few months. This one is by -FAR- the best K-drama I've seen, and better than most of the series I've seen in general. Everything comes together: great cinematography, good music, great script and subtle acting by three amazing actors.Highlight for me was of course the developing relationship between Moon-Youn and Gang-Tae. I've seldom seen such tenderness on-screen, yet it never becomes tacky as there's plenty of humour there as well. Also the interaction between Moon-Youn and Sang-Tae was splendid, and often hilarious. The plot concerning Moon-Young's past/mother could have been better developed, but that's nitpicking.In short, If this series doesn't move you, you don't have a soul.",10
East Asia,"Another interesting story about this girl, boy and his brother. Liked the story's in the drama and the moral of everyone one of them. They were wonderful and sad but at the same time very wonderful. I liked that type of drawing in the story even if it's for kids. How they were build and looked like.The girl in this drama, a famous writer who has two famous parents who's exist in a way but at the same time don't in another way. Her attitude was entertaining and interesting. I loved the way she took care of bad things, how she talked and was cold as ice even if that's not a very good thing to be. She didn't care about what other people thought about her or if they thought she did was wrong. She just didn't let anything stand in her way and did the things she decided to do.The boy in this drama don't have any parents, I don't remember about his and his brothers father but their mom got murdered. His brother was the only one who saw it but didn't remember their face. His sadness and loneliness hurt me, all he did was taking care of his brother without any parents. I felt bad for him most of the time but I just wanted to punch him sometimes too. When he looked back to when he was young it hurt me the most to see how he felt left out.Liked the actors and loved the bloopers at the end of the show! So cute to see how it looks like behind the scenes. Liked the layout of the story, that she had a moral in every book she wrote. Even if it was a tough way for them with problems and revealing truths it's a beautiful ending at the end and I'm very happy for them!????",9
East Asia,This might be my favorite Korean drama I've seen. From the animation to the books to the relationships it's sincere and inspired. Really beautiful story and characters. I can't say enough good things about it. Don't miss this one! Everyone is perfect. Really well done all around.,10
East Asia,"Outstanding series. This series had became my all time favourite. There is not a single department where this series lack of. From story to Cinematography, Animation to fairy tail, outstanding music and score. Spot on Acting by all the cast. Kudos to the director and writer and my favourite 'seo ye ji'.Must watch and also Hindi Dubbing is Outstanding.",10
East Asia,This is mandatory for ur watchlist....the plot is awesome...liked it.,10
East Asia,"Tldr; not for everyone, especially if you don't like unique and different. But if you like picking up that variety donut pack at the grocery store? This is for you, and a tissue box too!One reason why ""It's Okay to Not Be Okay"" is liked so much. It is literally a gem. The amount of elements it combines from horror, comedy, romance, and mystery; is just insane. Then the creators managed to have real children's books drive the story and still touch on sensitive mental issues.Trying to find a similar Kdrama is almost impossible, especially seeing this one delivered its' elements very well. You might get people calling it over rated just because it is not your stereotypical Kdrama. Which they would probably benefit watching something more vanilla.They also nailed their OST, atmosphere, and aesthetics. Really caught that depressing mood/vibe, while being uplifting when needed.The female lead (Seo Yea-Ji) played crazy love interest very well-to the point people are saying the male lead (Kim Soo-Hyun) didn't do good. I believe he did fine; it just that Seo out shined everyone. On top of that, she looked absolutely stunning in this Kdrama. If you look at her past roles; it is hard to believe it is the same actor.Easily one of my favs and probably is in a lot of people's top ten lists. Something to watch at least once, and then a 2nd time before you hit the hay.",10
East Asia,Absolutely amazing!! You have to watch this series to understand the level of amazing story telling talent that Korea has. Hollywood and bollywood lack this talent.,10
East Asia,The storyline is so engaging. You'll love the world created in this series. You are definitely gonnaove the whole cast. A must watch. Wish it never ended.,9
East Asia,"Just woww... The series is so fine that you can't define that in words. It shows the bond between two brothers in the best way. All characters are written and executed very well. Particularly you will love the character of Sang-tae who is the elder brother of Gang-tae. In their childhood a bad incident happens, due to which the siblings has to change their places often. Sang-tae is mentally weak, but he knows how to deal with people and he is expert in that. Gang-tae loves his elder brother Sang-tae immensely and he always takes care of him. As the story moves ahead, Gang-tae meets Ko Moon Yeung, an author and he starts loving her. The story however has a mystery of butterfly, due to which these brothers have to change their places. Overall this series is a bundle of emotional scenes, thrills and small laughing boosters. You must give it a watch......??????",10
East Asia,"Every part is adctive and writting screen was awesome. Its far different from other love stories and drama. One word for series ""ma$terpieace"".",9
East Asia,I'm from India ???? I watched first time I like this.,10
East Asia,Gang gae's brother sucks a lott...??If I would be there.....I would have killed him...how can he interrupt in his brother's life ??.....his friend also sucks.....,10
East Asia,"One of the best Kdrama i ever Watch, i definitely suggest this mind blowing drama,,,in this drama everyone put their best and help it to Reach on the pick. Loved this drama, wish I'll see this kind of drama another time,,I'm eagerly waiting for this kind of drama ????????",10
East Asia,"I just fell in love with the fairy stories in each episode. The cast is perfect ,full of strong emotions. I have laughed with the strong bold character of hero n heroine ..and i have cried with their emotional side as well. The childhood trauma of mine was a lot similar to the story.. may be i felt connected with the story, emotions and all tales eternally. Best series i ever watched.",10
East Asia,"This movie is a masterpiece! First the title of the drama isnt it a comforting pharse!? This is not a typical kdramas. 16episodes with 16different retelling of fairytales that will change your perspective, try seeing things from other sides:-)
i love Moon gangtae and his character development from a suppressed and stressful boy to a caring and brave man who will protect his loved ones.Moon sangtae who shows us how patients with autism live their lives and how amazing they can be.And the most important one is Ko munyeong, an antisocial children's book writer who can see through everything despite her scary character from the outside, in fact she is just a girl who needs warmth and love:-)
screenwriter jo young really studied hard on patients with psychiatric disorders and did an amazing job here
i cannot finish any other kdrama after IOTNBO because this sets such a high standard for me:)",10
East Asia,"At first the story seems a bit slow but there is no lack of energetic feeling in the story. As the story progresses, it will become more intense. The director knows very well how to attract the attention of the audience with a Ingenuous story. I enjoyed the whole time. All in all, the time was good. Everyone must see.",8
East Asia,"After I watch this drama drama I started to watch it again and again. This drama made me laugh, cry, and also know about psychology.",10
East Asia,"Well this was my first K drama that i watched i must say i was very impressed. From writing to direction, everything is perfect. Acting was at par especially by the guy who played Sang tae. I want to admit this that I'm in love with Seo yea ji after watching this show. This show is unique in terms of story telling. Mental health problem which i got to know is a major issue in South Korea was explained very well. Every character played their part very well which makes the show flawless until you reach the climaxI would have given it 10 rating easily because of the acting, cinematography, direction but climax was so horrible that i had to bring down the rating to 8. It appeared to me that climax was written by Ekta Kapoor where Mihir was resurrected after 20 years with a plastic surgery. Antagonist of this show, the mother, her character was never explained properly. Till the end i was clueless about the character of the mother. Why she was portrayed as a monster, how she escaped death, what did she want at the end? So many questions, nothing explained.Alternative ending according to me - As we know that the daughter had traumatic childhood because of her parents, director could have shown that she has overcome our trauma because of Gang tae and Sang tae's love and they have started a new family. No need to resurrect the mother. The show could have ended in 15th episode.",8
East Asia,"Although I could see the director trying to implant romance between main characters, the more I watched the more depressed I felt.Both of the main characters bear too much and left nothing to give. As a outside audience, I feel like I'm watching two drowning ppl, out of nature they're attached to each other but pulling to sink together. What kind of distorted and suffocative relationship is that. Yes the story is attractive but the same time made me feel really uncomfortable, I hope the main characters wont get together in the end(still at ep.7.",9
East Asia,OMG!!!Just completed the series and already fall in love with mun yeong.A beautiful face attact you alot but to fall in love its the vibes that should match with yours.They way she potrayed her emotions.. I have never seen it before.Lots of love to all the stars.. Its a family watch.,10
East Asia,"This is the first time i liked non-lead role very very much. I liked his acting very much (Jae-su). I am giving 10 out of 10 stars for him. Fabulous, Extra-ordinary.",10
East Asia,I healed the most after watching this drama. Very recommended!!!!,10
East Asia,"Beautiful Drama must Watch
Actors Did their acting Perfectly
One of the Best couple On Screen.",9
East Asia,The plot keeps you intrigued right from the beginning to the end. The characters are very well written and equally well performed.The music is the soul of the drama... Beautiful.. aesthetically pleasing... Locations used throughout lifts the mood! Kudos to the costume designer!Story is well written.. direction is amazing with the we'll use of comics and the graphics in between.The connection between past and present is very smooth.Most importantly the concept and the way importance given to mental health is encouraging in many ways.The climax was little disappointing in my opinion. It could have been lot better.Overall the best drama !!!,10
East Asia,Great story & awesome acting. The Koreans are on fire!! The story is about 2 brothers and a woman who are on a journey of self discovery. Special mention to Oh-Jung Se for his unbelievable acting as a person suffering from autism.,10
East Asia,A fantastic serie with amazing performances . The chemistry between the three lead characthers is fantastic. Oh Jeong-Se is spectacular as Moon Sang-tae.,10
East Asia,Omg ! A Must watch! First episode is Fantastic! Do not miss it. Absolute Gore fun. Delivers what it promises!! Man I don't usually comment but this is Epic!,9
East Asia,"Compelling, iam have way thru didn't got boring once so far. Nice designs, graphics and characters. Worth the watch for sure.",8
East Asia,I started it thinking it to be some intemse thriller with plot twists. But this is Pretentious garbage with no real thrill and not even single interesting twist. Waste of time.,1
East Asia,"If you have seen hostel ....then this series is just 100000000 times BETTER!!!!Unbelievable , thrill that gives you chill and makes you shrill !!!!The scenes are prolific that it stems SHOCK & AWE !MUST WATCH.",9
East Asia,"Dub was good. Awesome show, give it a watch it was a lot of fun.",9
East Asia,The trailer is much much much more exciting than the actual series. The episodes are not as thrilling as promised and is filled with unnecessary conversations.. this is a waste of time. It does have good graphics though..,4
East Asia,"When I first saw the trailer, I knew I would watch this show in one day. It is a nice thriller drama that kept me hook throughout. The games that were played and the relationships between the characters is what got me into this show even more. Ending was somewhat predictable, but it was still a good show to watch. I do recommend for you to watch it.",9
East Asia,"Just watched whole 9 episodes and my favorite was the 6th, Gganbu. Not perfect nor a masterpiece, but this is very well made and provides a certain level of emotional experience. The overall show was far beyond things that were shown in trailer. Very well directed, performed, and finding its own unique points from the genre mixture of various references such as Gambling Apocalypse : Kaiji, Battle Royale, and so on. Just hope all others enjoy this show not only in Korea but also everywhere!Ps. Even to Korean ears, VIPs' English conversations were not well written nor performed. I think the drama could stand well enough without their presence and save the budget.",9
East Asia,"Squid Game is a brilliant metaphor for several things, but especially capitalism. 456 broken and bankrupt rats are set on a deadly race for a vast prize in an absurd and cartoonish version of hell. And who would willingly leave hell if there was even a chance, however outlandish, that staying might suddenly make them a billionaire? Very little of this series otherwise makes sense, and it makes an absolute meal of it.There are similarities to shows like Battle Royale or Alice in Borderland, but Squid Game does a much better job of making characters believable and likeable. Even passing characters feel like actual people, so you care for the thirty seconds or so that you get to know them before they pass.The design of the show is brilliant, the performances are all excellent. The danger feels real and the jokes are genuinely funny. I'm only on episode 2, but I love this show already. Personally, I like it better than Alice in Borderland.EDIT: Just very quickly, a lot of reviews on here are mentioning the cringeworthy acting and dialogue of the VIPs. I agree, but I think there must be a reason for this. It seems unlikely that the same people who cast, wrote and directed all the other terrific performances suddenly lost the ability to cast, write for and direct non-Koreans. It seems more likely their relative cartoonishness had a specific meaning and purpose... even if we haven't figured out what it is, yet.",8
East Asia,"It has great suspenful moment and with decent to good character development. Due to this, a lot of the character death are painful to watch. It's definitely reccomended for those who love thriller. Plotwise, I would say it's decent enough to keep u watching and drive the story forward.",9
East Asia,"This reminds me of a lot of things; a mix of As gods will, Alice in borderland, Battle Royale, Kaiji etc. If you enjoyed those then you would like this series as well. Squid game is fascinating and keeps me on edge/ wanting more after each ep with how the games are set out it showcases a variety of Korean-style childhood games that I've never seen before. At the same time it can be a Melodrama that manages to provoke you emotionally and although it may be predictable at times it's definitely a enjoyable experience to watch. Not to mention players are interesting, with complex backstories and personalities. From a poor/ in-debt background they all strive with the same motive of money but at what cost? It's amusing to watch how everything unfolds but at the same time making you question a lot of things. I'm quite positive with how it left off that there might be a season 2 since there are a few things yet to be answered and revealed if so I wouldn't be surprised. Hats off to all the the people working on this project and the wonderful actors. Definitely felt like a roller coaster ride. Personally thought it was exciting, intense and satisfying watch for those who like this type of genres.",10
East Asia,This is only my second review. I binged this all in one day and loved it. I still like Alice in Borderland better but was a great show. Can't wait for a new season and to see what happens next.,8
East Asia,"This show is really good and exciting. The cast is doing a really good job and I cared for the characters. The sets and camerawork were also beautiful there was not much action but when there was it was well shot. And finally, the story was solid there was only one plotline that wasn't properly ended but aside from that it was really good.",9
East Asia,"5th episode is in, so far I haven't seen a higher level of violence and gore that I was expecting to see. It's a survival game genre TV show, but it hasn't been living up to its premise yet. Also, the show has a lot of side stories, so if one was expecting to see a simple kill and run show, then they will probably find this show boring. Lastly, the show is full of korean cultural references which can also be a boring factor for many viewers. It's simply because people can't understand what's going on and have more questions rather than enjoying the thrills of the ride. Overall, the show is entertaining and enjoyable. It still drew me to the 5th episode straight. But again It would have been nicer if it had more actions unless the show was originally intended as a social commentary. One more thing, it was really nice to see an indian actor as one of the main characters in the show. I know It's not a lot, but still it adds a lot of positive effects in the show.",7
East Asia,2 episodes in and already hooked. It has basic concept that we have seen in other movies but Koreans know how to write unlike western writers. Characters get flushed out and you actually care about them. Acting is also really good (non of that cringy western actors). If you like well written thrillers definitely check this one out.,8
East Asia,"Was released today and I was hooked by the first 20 minutes. I finished it all the same day , if there was more seasons I would've been watching the next episodes as I'm typing this up right now. Very good series that will have you at the edge of your seat with many twists and turns. Once you think you know what's coming next , it hits you with a curveball. Highly recommended .You can watch this in one day easily as I did & it was just released a couple hours ago haha .",10
East Asia,"Truly a well-directed, well-acted, well-produced and casted series. I dare say I wish it could continue, but all games must end to have a victor!Thank you for this very bingeworthy story. Thank you all cast and crew involved. Despite not knowing more than 3 words in Korean I recognized several actors. Goes to show, Hollywood ain't everything!*To those that find this 'boring', please understand you need Michael Bay or shiny keys to keep your attention. *snap* Hello?! Are you listening?!*",9
East Asia,Was expecting a typical graphic Korean movie... Turned out the movie was engaging with a nice twist to the ending. Highly recommended!,10
East Asia,"A true survival series and extremely suspenseful. Enjoy it, well worth it!!!",9
East Asia,Another game style type of movie from Korea.Great acting. Storyline good.The only reason I give it a 9 is because of it gets too many 10s one crazy rich guy out there might find it inspirational to start this type of game in real life.,9
East Asia,"Perfect acting ??.. interesting series, with unexpected events.",8
East Asia,"Great series! Story, characters, setting, and mood was nice. Except for the actors who played the VIPs. That was terrible acting and it could have been better casted and directed. But all in all, season 1 was great!",9
East Asia,"Excellent showcase of human mind and emotions. Its the battle of strong people against the weak people covering all aspects such as morality ,honesty,sacrifice,smartness,cunningness and so on.This series is definitely worth your time and will hook you up to watch the season at a single stretch.",9
East Asia,Yes very unique content most powerful never miss. Most enjoyable.,9
East Asia,"Acting 10/10
Story 10/10.I higly recommend this series.",10
East Asia,I loved the way the entire drama revolves around the true nature of humans. At every stage this drama never stops to surprise you. Tons of plot twists that add depth to characters and the plot itself. This is one of a kind show (genre & quality wise). You wont find anything like this anywhere. It is absolutely well written.I want to remove my memories and watch this again.,10
East Asia,"My God the actors who potrayed the VIP people cannot act. I cringed everytime they said a line. It felt like they were just reading them. Even the intonation was off. It was like when we were kids and had to read a play in class and we exagerated the intonation. Terrible, just awful.",7
East Asia,"I dont know how it happend, but a couple of days ago i was memorising my childhood (thats not happening a lot). And then i had a strong memory about this childhood game we used to play as kids in the neighborhood. And guess what? That game was the 1st game those players in this tv show played (i dont remember its name in a foreign language), the one they needed to freeze after the count stop... So i was realy amazed by finding this great tv show. Its seriously shown how our mind worked as kids and how we been more active as kids- as shown Through all the games in this amazing tv show. So yes its a big 10/10 for me.Recommended to any human being on this earth.",10
East Asia,I like it so so much ... It was the first to end in first day ... But i think there will be season 2 bcs its not completed ... I hope its near bcs i can't wait.,10
East Asia,"Really good show, until the VIPs show up in episode 7. Worst acting I've ever seen. It's like the director doesn't understand English himself and hired random American guys off the street. It doesn't ruin the show, but it's so bad. In general though this is definitely worth a watch.",9
East Asia,"I am at the 3rd episode in a row! This is really entertaining in a good manner of modern Korean mystery dramas. Well done, usually I am quite skeptical about Netflix shows but this one is truly good one. Enjoy!",9
East Asia,DefinitelyThe director is a fan of Playstation.>.<,8
East Asia,"Plot, visuals, acts, scale... every elements were so well prepared and harmonized. The characters have distinct personalities and are very interesting.According to the characteristics of each stage of the survival game, the appearances of the characters collide and gather whenever they encounter in extreme situations. All those factors fit each other amazingly well. Each character also represents an aspect of society issue or shape of human beings.This movie is not only giving you entertainment, but also throw questions about matter of humanity, morals, strategy, social issues, family and the weight of life & death.There is no scene to skip.",10
East Asia,"Honestly, i skipped the story of the player's background. But when the game began to play with all the gripping game stage, its excited me. This serial is a mix between the Hunger Games and Saw. You'll never expect whose the boss of all deadly games, if you already watched Saw movies, then you'll know.",8
East Asia,It is a nice thriller drama that kept me hook throughout.I love battle royal concept and this is one of the best in this concept.Acting was so good and cameos were amazing.I recommended for you to watch it.,9
East Asia,This show?! I have no words?! Really good 10/10!! I am amazed.,10
East Asia,"Korean TV shows are traditionally a step below their movies, which have been the best in the world for a while now. With its budget, production quality and talent Squid Game could have been the one show that got away but all is sadly ruined by Lee Jung-jae overacting pretty much every scene he's in, he just doesn't seem to be able to ground his character. Granted, some of the writing is over the top too, which doesn't help but the director should have helped him calibrate. In comparison Gong Yoo and especially Lee Byung-hun own the screen and ooze charisma every single time despite very brief appearances.It's still a good show and overall quite watchable but it's just not great.",6
East Asia,Everthing is amazing i really like it so much i hope there is season 2.,7
East Asia,So boring. Try to be cool but no brain to do.Boring plot. Boring writer.Too drama. No fun. Nothing interesting.All can be is some series that just play and do something else.,3
East Asia,I started it and thinking this is going to be a B-tvseries but it's AMAZING! When I think I know what's going to happen they throw a curveball.What an amazing tvserie.,9
East Asia,"If you're not used to this Survival Game genre, you might find it exciting. As a long fan of this genre, I can make sure that this series is undoubtedly one of the worst among all. The problems lie severely in 2 key points that make a good Survival Game Film: The games and The story-telling. While the games, without exaggeration, are horribly boring, forcing, and lack the creativity to the point I don't even know if they actually spend time thinking about the game or they just pick it up randomly on the internet. The storytelling method badly worsens it with so many unnecessary scenes and lines. Towards the end of the series, I have to watch it with 1.5x speed, and still, it is irritatingly slow. That is not the worst yet. The SUPER CRINGE appearance of the VIPs just to show labor class discrimination is unacceptable and horrifically unnatural. They try to put on life-lesson so bad that the lesson turns out to be pathetically ridiculous.Tl,dr: this movie is cringed, poorly told, wayy overrated, and definitely one of the worst in this genre.",1
East Asia,"Wow! This should an award series of 2021 in Netflix. The story does contain both funny and horror at the same time. In fact, those actors were all perfect for those roles and it really draws your attention to chase the episode like crazy!Even in these covid times, this film creator and director does know how to pull audiences with a mix of keeping the tradition but develop modern series!Thank you so much for this wonderful series!",10
East Asia,This is definitely the most diverse drama I've watched it really is like no other drama I binged it in two days it kept me hooked first episode hopefully there is a second season because whilst the concept was gruesome and inhumane I really enjoyed watching it.,10
East Asia,I really enjoyed this tv show. It was a little slow sometimes but it was still good. I really hope for a season 2.,8
East Asia,"The film making, characters, acting and premise was absolutely brilliant.I did find myself rolling my eyes more times than I'd hoped as characters made completely illogical decisions (I'm looking at you Ali) which conveniently fit the plot. I feel like it was cheap story telling that the writers thought the viewer wouldn't notice.The voice actors for the VIP's were horrific but hey it is a Korean series.Overall I'd give a 7.8.",7
East Asia,I feel like I hace seen this before a lot of times. It just feels like hunger games feel wise(Just the context not the spesific things) But in general executed above avarage.,7
East Asia,"Squid Game. Wow.Korean.Best description? Uncomfortably genius!(Kind of disturbing - small warning but still)I mean there are some elements of The Game and Hunger Games, but this is bigger, more catastrophic in a different way, more clever, plays on psychological aspects, with a touch of closeness between some participants. Its intensely catchy and totally insane.Its set in a today's society with participants being people in economic trouble who owes a lot of money, mostly from gambling, and about their desperation. Great actors too!!They even include a very dark business of todays world - but I wont reveal anything here.Although its brutal - its more brutal in what's actually going on, and what's happening - than being graphically brutal.And you will sit there and feel lots of things - scared and somewhat freaked out as well, and as I said: its Uncomfortably geniusly made in my opinion.If you're looking for something different that will get your HR rising, try this one! *Handclaps*",9
East Asia,"This drama is probably one of the most compelling battle royale content out there. The last episode was a bit boring as it tried to set up a bridge towards season 2, but overall the dram has a really interesting storyline.",9
East Asia,"Even though there are many gameshows that require contestants to survive for one reason or another, Squid Game stands out thanks to its breathtaking visuals and superbly written characters. The former is done through colorful scenery that perfectly fits the ""kids games"" theme as well as the organized nature of a secretive organization's facility that houses so many people. As for the latter, EVERY character is struggling to make ends meet but how they put themselves in that position is extremely unique. The group is diverse with the main guy having to pay a debt he owes to land sharks, his friend having embezzled money from his business, an old man who is living out his remaining time with a brain tumor, a gangster who stole money from his boss, a woman who got scammed and more. Add to that the dark humor, an unraveling mystery surrounding the game show, and violence and you have the recipe for an addictively bingeable show.",9
East Asia,"A series or movie that makes time pass quickly because you're so into it is greatly appreciated by me. So many titles to choose from but only a few leave you with a feeling of satisfaction after viewing. Several Korean series hit that mark, Vagabond, Kingdom, Tunnel, to name a few. The only problem I have is with scenes that go on way to long, Nine episodes could've been cut to six with some efficient editing but other than that I loved it.",8
East Asia,Very well made series. They have done an exceptional job here with Netflix money. Definitely recommend.,10
East Asia,"The show is great games in show is simple and easy for all people in the country religious to play but the show also has disadvantages that has a lot details that not make sense in show, also the plot twists are easy to predict. At this point Alice in Boderland is better.",8
East Asia,Muat watch this series this is a gem well written and such a smooth script no boring scenes.,10
East Asia,"We go through all the emotions in front of this series.One of the best show ever made, Netflix or otherwise.",9
East Asia,"The show has themes and ideas that convey intense meaning. It gives joy and laughter, and every character is thought out to great detail. Keeps you on the edge and wanting more. You'll laugh, you'll cry and you'll feel for character's as if you were them. Absolutely wanting and looking foward to a season 2. Brilliant.",9
East Asia,"Great acting, very interesting storyline. As someone who is fluent in Korean, I am watching the show without having to rely on the subtitles. As someone who is also fluent in English, I am reading the subtitles as well. I cannot believe that this high budget production is ruined by shockingly poor translation. For non-Korean speakers who must rely on the subtitles, please believe me when I tell you that the actual dialog is not that poor. It's shame that Netflix does not have any QC over translated subtitles.",6
East Asia,"Pretty Entertaining.!!It's the first time I've seen Lee Jung-Jae in a series. I know this will be good. I've watched movies where he starred in and most of them are so good. If you liked Battle Royale, Saw, or any other Survival Movies/Series and enjoy plots that involve thinking, psychology and strategy , Do Not Miss this out.The Western actors though are so bad at acting.Warning : A scene contains flashing lights that may cause discomfort or trigger seizure for people sensitive to light.",8
East Asia,Series is good we fans are waiting for the season 2 hope so it will be available in short time.,10
East Asia,Squid Game takes a oft used trope and keeps it fresh and gripping.,9
East Asia,My first review... you will not regret watching this as fans of both thrillers and korean dramas... this film really has outdone itself.,10
East Asia,I never got to watch any series after Mind hunter and Kingdom that kept me hooked. The Squid Game hits off right from the Episode 1. The series deals with all the aspects of human emotions especially GREED! This show cant be missed at any cost. This series deserves 10/10.,10
East Asia,"Absolutely brilliant! Loved it from start to finish, excellent acting (apart from the American actors at the end! Dreadful) Great story, had me hooked.. binged watched the lot!Looks like they'll be a second series which I can't wait to see! Superb.",10
East Asia,"Was not expecting how deeply it makes you feel for all of the characters, there's a real connection you feel which makes you want them to win even more. Great plot with unexpected twists, would recommend this to everyone I know and anyone reading this.",10
East Asia,I ended binge watching this show. Edge of the seat series. Very layered.you will not be disappointed. One of the very best. Hope there is a season 2.,9
East Asia,"I have to say after watching the trailer, I immediately saved this series to my watch list and could not wait until it is out.However, maybe due to my high expectation I was quite disappointed after finishing the 1st season on one run. Believe me, I'm a sucker for this kind of genre so I'm looking for interesting plot, great games and unpredictable twists. If you're the same as me, the series will not deliver these. I found some parts are redundant with unnecessary overacting, I had to skip plenty times. The plot is quite boring for me compared to other survival-game series. But, I cannot deny the cinematography is great.If you have some time to kill, it still brings you some entertainment. Keep your expectation lower to enjoy it more if possible.",6
East Asia,"This felt like yet another Korean remake of a popular Japanese TV show and/or movie (which itself was originally a manga) -- The movie in question is, ""As The Gods Will"" which came out in Japan back in 2014. Sure, they changed just enough so as to avoid any messy legal IP/copyright issues, but let's not pretend this movie is an original idea.I personally don't mind remakes, especially with foreign films being localized for a different audience (& culture). I just don't like it when try to pass off the remake as their original idea.As far as the show itself goes, it wasn't bad. I rather liked it, and liked the fact it was a TV show instead of a movie -- with a TV show you get more time to explore the world & characters. Acting was OK, cinematography was excellent and the writing wasn't bad either. I'd definitely recommend this movie to friends.",7
East Asia,One of the best TV Shows I have ever seen. Simply genious and almost realistic. 6th episode is FABULOUS.I love this TV Show and one of the favourites from 2021.,10
East Asia,"For someone who has seen Alice in Borderland and loved it, I see this series as a more mature and rawer version, without fantasies. Criticism of the capitalism of today's society, ironic how it turned out, becoming everything it criticized.Decent 8/10.",8
East Asia,The details are in every scene. Wish to see another season.,10
East Asia,"Good writing, good acting for most part (except the American actors), good messages, pacing is good.There really isn't much to complain about it once you're immersed into it besides the voices and acting of the American actors.",9
East Asia,A large group of people who are down on their luck are invited to a game where all their money troubles can be solved. The only thing they don't know is that it will be a bloody battle for survival and they will each learn how far they will go just to survive. It is a little predictable in the overall concept but does have some surprises in leading up to the finale. Well acted and a reasonable pace over 9 episodes with a few plot twists keeps your attention.,8
East Asia,"It's really an awesome show, episodes are 1 hour or more long however you won't feel that time coz series never gets bore or slow, once you will start it you will finish it in one go. Watch it, it's really worth of your time.",8
East Asia,"This was one of the best kdramas i've watched on netflix! The storyline, the actors, the acting, it was wonderful. I've never rushed to finish a series before like i did with this one!",10
East Asia,"I liked it but the last few episodes were too slow so I had to watch them at 1.5X speed. All in all, it is an odd and entertaining series nicely designed but not as unique as some claim. I do not know if the actors were poorly directed, if they are bad at acting or if it is a cultural thing but I thought many of the characters were overacting.If you have seen The Hostel franchise, Funhouse, The Maze Runner, Battle Royale, the Saw franchise, you will recognize a lot in this series. However, Squid Game stands out with its colorful design and imaginative theme and I liked it. Definitely worth a shot.",7
East Asia,"You just name it and this web series got it all....love, sex, games, betrayal, humor, emotions, twists, drama and what not!This series is about a group of 456 players who get a chance to get off their economically miserable life by winning 46 billion wons and that is by winning in 6 games, a few of them being kids game. But its not so easy peasy as one thinks as each game has dire consequences and shrewd twists.All these long 9 episodes are super gripping and interesting. The games are quite thrilling to watch as players are forced to make some real shocking decisions and betrayals to win. What you notice is so many different shades of human being comes into play when money is the subject OR you could say, when money is the subject, there is little room to loyalty.I will agree Ep 6 is the best of all. Gganbu! This is the longest and by far the best i have seen. The game that they are given to play comes with a twist when players thought it to be otherwise and that part was quite fun to watch until....they are forced to make some shocking decisions to decide who should win. This episode tests the loyalty of people against the ones they love or have developed a good relation. It throws the audience into thinking....who should live and who should get eliminated! Not to forget, this , along with the last episode oozed emotions.But Episode 9 too is quite great as it comes in with a shocking twist! It puts forward the same question that generations after generation has been asked...""Can money buy you happiness?"". It also leaves some questions unanswered...what is the FRONT MAN's exact goal (FYI, this man too is a twist factor) and who is the mysterious handsome guy who gives Gi-hun that card?There's just so much in this series and everything is executed next to perfectly. The VIPs though are very bad in acting that is one negative. Overall, a must watch entertainer which can be binge watched in one go (or you may take two days considering it is a bit too long).",10
East Asia,One of the best Korean series I have watched and loved every aspect of the show!. All the actors did exceptionally well. Eagerly waiting for another Season!,10
East Asia,"So Initially I liked this.Than in the last couple of episodes everything was ruined.It sort of forgets what the main character wants to become.So the game has been running for decades. Yet it was sponsored by a man who died in the last episode???How does that work?I am sure some of the translations where not correct.The shaky English by the V. I. P. S sort of make that obvious. The V. I. P. S have to be the worst actors I have seen in a Korean show. I can't believe those people even have resumes and all experience as writers.... Can't they tell them to get other talent. Why did the majority of them have to be Westerners as well ???So after this was ruined. I looked back. And thought about what I liked.And I have to admit I was blinded by some of the decors and the art direction.There is too much that doesn't make sense , like the side operation run by some of the employeesSo the minimum I can give is 1 star when I rate a title.I gave it two stars because I liked the acting of the character Sae Byeok by Hoyeon Jung. As well as the other girl she paired up with in episode 5 and 6.I decided not to give a star for the art direction as their were some obvious fails to that as well. But I don't think the art department can be held responsible for that.They did have the best lines and writing as well.Really this is not worth your time as well.... just watch battle royale or tag.The shooting of this might have been a lot of fun. That is why it sort of is funny that the sick organisor says it is more fun if you participate instead of watching . Well I think this holds true for this show.",2
East Asia,"This whole thing worked very well for me. With the exception maybe for the VIP scenes (how were they so bad?). Otherwise I loved all the character growth/progression or degression in some aspects. And I was very entertained the whole 9 episodes, which I watched over 2 days!",9
East Asia,"The show hooks you right away on the first episode, but as the climax comes into play along with some supposedly plot twists being revealed, you realize how the show took the cheap and easy route.The characters don't make sense, especially Gi Eun and Sang Woo. Their character developments change drastically out of nowhere which makes no sense, especially towards the end.Since when was Gi Eun so heroic? Ok, let's say he cared about his daughter, and now that he has won the game, he is going to abandon her again? I really don't buy that his character is going to fight for justice, since he has been a weakling and won a lot of the games by luck. He is also a coward and has relied on others to win the game, so I don't get what he's thinking to go back. What is he going to do anyway? WHO TOLD HIM TO SIGN UP FOR THEM, NOT ONCE, BUT TWICE?Since when did Sang Woo feel remorseful? It's not within his character to stab himself. He didn't even feel bad when he let Ali die or when he killed Sae Byeok.The reveal of the player 1 was really a cop out and is supposed to add shock factor, but it was so cheap and obvious. It has been done a million times already.We also don't get closure from the cop and his supposedly Front Man brother, which shows that they are heavily reliant on a second season.I had other nitpicks with the characters, but it was more obvious towards the end where the flaws lie.In retrospect, I think the show has a good way of hooking you in and keeping you on your toes since you want to see how the characters will get out, and the games were enjoyable to watch. The actors did a fine job, and I think it's within the culture to have exaggerated characters. The plot has a weird way of grabbing your attention and makes you want to binge, but it is a cheap thrill like Money Heist. Ultimately, the ending kind of ruined it for me, since it went against everything that was within its message and having the characters change 180 did not help. If it had ended similarly to Parasite, where Gi Eun is sent back to society, but he is still not happy because money doesn't buy happiness then it works out. But this ending? CHEAP.6.5.",7
East Asia,"Other says Alice in Borderland has much intensity especially in episode 3 . But squidgame, it has a heart, loyalty . It's a mix of As God's Will, Triangle (2011) that ship scene.",9
East Asia,"The main character is a foolish, clueless, impulsive, emotionally self-indulgent jerk.Other characters, flawed but fundamentally good people, die getting him back to the real world with that 45.6B won (~40M USD), but what does he do for the first year of having all that money? Does he help any of the loved ones left behind by those people who died getting him there with all that money?No, he leaves them all hanging, suffering for another year in the circumstances that were so bad it caused those good people who died saving him to go into and then back into that bloody Hell to try to save them.And then what does he do when he decides to go after the people behind the game? He calls them up and threatens them, making sure they know he's an enemy to be removed.He's a very unpleasant, impulsive and judgmental fool. Fortunately, although he's clearly the main character from start to finish, he doesn't dominate too much screen time, and there are plenty of other characters to enjoy watching .... although they pretty much all die.",8
East Asia,"Wow, this show had me hooked from the first episode. I've never been able to watch dubbed shows before but this was an exception! Watched every episode last night... amazing story and actors. If this was a movie it probably would have seemed ""cheesy"" to many Americans. I'm so glad they made it a tv show with plenty of time to build the characters and get the story right!",9
East Asia,"Netflix seems to be able to find these ""box set""versions of visual cocaine that make one unable to stop the 'next episode' button. This Korean paranoid vision of game show euthanasia does kinda feel like something I'd seen it before, Battle Royale, The Cube, Maze Runner and even The Prisioner spring to mind. However, if you can get past the slightly weird dialogue and the slightly uncomfortable attitude towards women then it's a beautiful looking and engaging series.",7
East Asia,"This show keeps you glued to your seat from start to finish. It's done very well from every point of view, just the police actor shoul have been less younger.I hope for a second season.9/10 Bravo.",9
East Asia,"Better cast, script and plot than Borderland!Only downside- edge of the seat and non stop binging effect.",10
East Asia,Wife and I really enjoyed the series. The storyline and acting was great.The only thing I would fault it on is the foreigners in the show. The Korean actors were top notch and believable.... while the vips just seemed like they found random foreigners in Seoul to play the characters. Even Abi seemed a bit strange at times.,8
East Asia,RECOMMENDED. Finished this in one night. I cant stop watching it. Worth every episodes.,9
East Asia,"Honestly the best tv show i've ever watched. Recommend it definitely 100%. Everyone should watch it, I finished the whole season in a day and a half.",10
East Asia,"This has budget, making for some entertaining scenes, but the plot is quite poor, many parts didn't make sense, too much of it down to luck and it's very predictable. The characters' back stories are uninteresting, there's not much character development. It's average at best for the genre.",6
East Asia,"I know that as one ages one turns into a grumpy old flatulating individual passing plenty of not just faeces but righteous judgement on a collapsing morally bankrupt world. All said, this 'review' comes from a person who saw Lord of The Flies when about 14 after our superb English teacher felt it worth seeing after we read the book as part of our education. I found both the book and movie so traumatic they changed my life. But probably in a good way. The point being made that below a certain age or level of training, young people are not suited to positions of power or leadership. More recently, productions and video games based on the Battle Royale principle also alert us as to the ethics of exploiting vulnerable young people for the schadenfreude entertainment of adults and a baying public. Sadly, The Hunger Games put production spectacle and creepy puppeteers ahead of violence, so the point wasn't really made, but it has the benefit of warning a younger audience how some adults use them.*** SPOILER ALERT ***
I had never heard of Squid Game and happened to catch it on Netflix last night where I saw the first episode. What got me was now just how there was NO humor in it at all, common with today's productions, but the pure blood spurting realistic brutality of the scene where the giant 'little' girl guns down those who are caught moving.As per The Hunger Games, the aesthetics and production design is superb, but can someone explain to me WHY such content is produced in the first place? Is Squid Game entertainment or a warning? And why is it a 15, not an 18? Alien was never gratuitously violent (they were at war) yet an 18 or X when released in the 70s. I know, I saw it when 15 and was terrified!My rating is based on the ethics of SG being a 15, not the quality of the production,",1
East Asia,"Meh. Overrated. It keeps banging the same drum about what you'd do in a game if it was your life versus another's life. It's got a certain style, but the acting was amateurish and melodramatic. Sorta like anime.",4
East Asia,An absolute thriller! The comedy gets you off guard even in the midst of a nail biting story! Enjoyed it.,9
East Asia,An absolute gem from South Korea. Amazing show from the first ep. To the last one. A must see...,10
East Asia,"Korean Hunger Games with better acting and much more relatable themes. The plot allegory focuses on the rampant exploitation of poor and desperate people, with the initial invitation to play the game and everything that follows appealing to their need to clear debts. This soon becomes about something much bigger and darker. Not for the squeamish.No spoilers, but I will say I'm a vehement anti-binger when it comes to my viewing habits. In the 10-odd hour runtime of this series, though, I stopped only to sleep and make a chicken wrap.",10
East Asia,"Engaging from start to end. Exciting, shocking, yet with a fresh and unique storyline that's delightful to watch and visually pleasing. Actors play amazing performances. I could compare to hunger games, but probably 10 times better.",10
East Asia,The show is still great though and can't wait for season 2.,8
East Asia,"Although I don't usually like violent weird fictional series I would like to comment on this one, which I found to be quite good if you watch it as a metaphor of the financial game, the squid game is in my view the financial game and I would like to give some hints of why I think this. There may be some spoilers ahead, so don't read further if you don't want to know them.In the series we are introduced to some characters that have already played the game, or similar games like gambling (most of the new players are highly indebted) or are just very poor people that will be invited to play the big game, which comes with the much needed reward, the big money.The gameThe game is the financial game and we see the players being part of it trying to get the big price but dying in the way because of that. Nobody has been forced to play the game but nobody knows what the game is about, and as soon as they are in the game they can't leave it if is not by a majority deciding so. And this is the big question asked for the game designers when participants are showed that the game will play with their jobs, their families subsistence and, in sum, with their lives.""Knowing this, do you accept the game or do you refuse it? ""Nicely, after the first deadly round the vote is tied, and the last voter, the player number one, which later on we will know is a game designer playing for fun, the only one on the game from the elite, the only one that deeply knows about the game and may by himself stop it, votes to stop the game giving to the poor folks the chance to live a decent live far from the deadly game. But the game never stops, so most of the players return to it when given a new chance to win or die.The island, the leader and the policemanThe game is corrupted, so it has to be played in an island, a tax haven, outside the law. This is a parallel plot ran by two brothers, one of them running the game, the leader, that would be the corrupt lawyer or the broker that we learn that already got his money share when he won a previous edition of the games, and a policeman, the law, that manages to get there looking for him as the leader is his brother, and that sadly is being killed by the corrupted brother being unable to expose the plot to the justice.The secondary playersBetween the players we find some of the social archetypes. There is the gangster, used to play by his own wild rules but without the skills and the knowledge to win in the big game, the immigrants, political and non political, playing with their disadvantages and being cheated and murdered, people with family traumas for whom the game means nothing now, the broker who already played the game in the real life before and failed, and who knows that the game has to been played dirty if you want to win, but even like this, you may always loose, ...The old man and the main characterFinally, between the players, there are two of them especially interesting, the first one and the last one. The first one is, as we find out at the end, a game designer that is so implied in it that cannot be like the other VIPs, gambling and watching from the outside, but has to play. His reward is not the money but the act of playing itself. The last one is all of us, is the TV watcher watching all of them, watching the game and being fascinated for it but at the same time refusing it, not willing to fall in its trap, not wanting to be mean, trying not to play dirty but at the same time doing nothing in front of the horror. This is why the old man takes an interest on him and there is a wonderful scene in the game of marbles where he sets up a situation inviting to the honest player to cheat, and he, the honest hero, cheats to save his life knowing that the old man will be unfairly killed for this. And then is when the old man gives him his last marble as reward, because the old man has now win his own game, he has finally won his own reward that isn't the money but knowing that everybody has a price and that everybody would have done what he possibly has done to become who he is. He can get rid of his guilt and he can leave the game as the real winner. However, when the hero wins the final game and may be proclaimed as winner, he refuses to win, he tries unsuccessfully to leave the game giving up the reward, and goes like this after that, being impossible for him to do anything with a money that becomes dirty as it has been earned cheating a poor old man who was killed because of it. He and the old man are on a similar situation now, both are rich thanks to the misery of others, and both feel guilty about it. So, in a desperately bid to get rid of his own culpability, of his own failure, the old man reveals him who he is, which is for some time effective, because our hero learns that nobody died because of him cheating and that he was the one cheated by the old man, so he may feel innocent again and enjoy the reward, until this falls again in front of the truth, revealed now by the recruiting scene of new potential gamers in the metro. Nobody who knows and has played the game may be innocent anymore.",8
East Asia,"I found the show to be fantastic, only ruined by the horrible VIP acting.",9
East Asia,"This movie offers nothing new within this genre of movie but it does deliver its story in a solid, pleasant way, wrapped in very well designed and visually appealing sets.The only major problem I have with it is the acting.It's not that the acting is bad (except for a few exceptions) but more so that characters are acted out in a comic- or anime-style way, which is what the director wanted, I guess.Almost everything is over-the-top and at least for my taste cringe-worthy and comical instead of realistic. For example: you will often see 'fear of death' portrayed (acted) in a hilarious, comical way, which can (at least for some people) be extremely awkward, since the movie has an overall dark, serious and brutal tone. This contrast does not work well, at least for me.So, if you like extreme over-acting and enjoy seeing anime-style behavior in a real movie: go for it. Otherwise you may find if off-putting.",6
East Asia,It was an ok watch to start with but then each episode just dragged and dragged on making it quite drawn out and boring. Should have made it into a 5/6 episode series. Doubt i'll watch another series if they make one.,5
East Asia,"The best way to describe this show is the feel of black mirror and the politics of parasite. I loved every second of this show from the characters,plot to the games,although I loved this show but please don't make a season 2 make this a one time thing it ended great and I feel like a season 2 would just drag the premise. Don't fall into the trap of other shows where the first season was brilliant but the later seasons were downgraded in quality.",9
East Asia,"This series really gave me goosebumps, thrill, and emotional attachment for the first 5-6 episodes (4th game), then the VIPs come and boom, what's going on?The worst part of this series is the VIPs. Idk why would they cast these foreigners. Their scripts and acting is soooo annoying, exaggerated, and their roles and existence?? So unnecessary. Every dialogs from their side are so cringy, and it hurts my ears. Their acting skills made want to skip the whole series or just fastforward it.Then the police. I was so excited whenever I see the police in actions. But the conclusion? Hus fate? Damn it was so disappointing, like all the struggles he went through means nothings. There was no clarity of his fate, and I can only assume that all the recordings and proof were not sent at all as the game still continue a year after and no further investigation were mentioned.5th game and 6th game, the VIPs came for the most exciting game of all. But what? Both were so boring and there was no thrill or emotional attachment like the previous 4 games.The conflict between gu han and sang woo. The hell? It was so rushed! Just after 1 game, and the relationship broke just like that and they decided to kill each other? And why suddenly sang woo decided to kill himself after the last 5th game he didnt feel remorse or guilt to the people he sacrificed???After gu han, who won all games by luck, he decided to did nothing with his money, even to the point he did not help Sae Byeok's lil bro, Sang Woo's mother, and especially reclaim his daughter until a year the game ended??? What was that all about?? And just when he finally decided to meet his daughter, he decided to get back to the game, in which he won all pure by luck? (Except for 2nd game)Plot twist was so predictable as well.Couldve given a much lower stars, but the korean actors did well with their acting, and the first half of the season was still satisfying.",5
East Asia,Loved every episode. Give it a chance. Definitely not the same ol crud that gets pumped out over and over these days.,9
East Asia,"Probably one of the most cliché, ""battle royale"" kind of storyline... BUT... It was still very gripping, intense, and entertaining. Definitely a binge worthy show! I can really see the typical K-drama elements in this show - you know, the unnecessary and far-fetched plot twist that almost makes you feel like it's trying to make up for something? Yeah, that. I could probably list all the cliché and predictable moments in this show but I don't want to spoil it for anyone.However, I can't deny the fact that this really did get me binge watching for 2 days. Perhaps, it's the great acting or the overly indulgent storyline - I'm not sure but I was hooked.",7
East Asia,"Just binged the whole 9 episodes, best thing I've seen on Netflix since I opened my account. Even though it's dubbed, you hardly notice! Watch it, you won't be disappointed! ??????",10
East Asia,"One of the best K Netflix series I've seen in recent years. The plot, cinematography, and acting (with the exception of some masked caucasians in the end) was superb. Several A-list actors were in this show and the cameos by them were very well woven into the story. Looking forward to a season 2.",10
East Asia,"This is a gripping, bingeable series. Without a doubt. It is fast-paced and builds anticipation throughout.But once the mystery fades, we see a pretty shallow set-up. Promising character development ultimately does not hold up, with some making seemingly inexplicable (but plot advancing) decisions. Other supporting characters have absolutely no-depth at all to the point of being gratingly inhuman. Other reviewers compare it to anime/cartoon. I agree.In the end, there are enough open questions to support a second season but unfortunately not enough resolution in the first season to feel we really got the payoff we needed for putting up with all that violence.",5
East Asia,"I use to binge watch shows a lot. Then I kind of went through a slump. This show reminds me what a good show is about. The main cast were generally very good at making me sympathize. I think I recognize the stormshadow actor from GI Joe. The rich elite VIP actors (as other have mentioned) I swear were told to be hammy. Thankfully their scene presence is short. Make no mistake, this show is somber, melancholic and not a rainbow /sunshine kind of show.Some questions about this world is revealed and so It sounds like there could be a season 2 but I really kind of wish they don't focus on the games again.",8
East Asia,"I have finished to watch this Korean Drama, it is very good, will this renews Season 2?",8
East Asia,"I really enjoyed the show as a whole, but it was so predictable that it became more and more annoying with every episode, 0 twists and suprises. I could tell how the ending is gonna look just after the first game. I Immediately knew that the old guy is involved and they didn't even try to hide it, same scenario about the leader of the game, i knew that they are related, about 5 seconds after the cop found the card in his room. But that really can be just me, so my ranking is not affected by that. Acting is on a pretty decent level, except the VIP-s , these guys were really bad, it felt like they got netflix employees to do the scenes because there was a shortage of english-speaking people to do it. Overall the show was really fun and entertaining. One of the best shows that netflix came out with lately.",7
East Asia,"This show is the best versions of a genre which has been done before. It's just unbelievably aesthetic, gripping and full of suspense. Some episodes are funny and some are very heavy. The season ending is perfect and fulfilling.",10
East Asia,"Wow, I cannot believe this show! Ending was a bit
????? But overall excellent great work Netflix.",10
East Asia,"Right off the bat, I smelled something fishy when Player 1 was actually Player 1. There were plenty of plotholes such as:Gi-hun owed the loan sharks and he tells them he'll pay them in full ""next month"" but we learn that he hasn't touched his winnings from the account so how did he pay them off?Diagnosed with diabetes and nearing amputation, Gi-hun's mother is not even in the hospital upon his return but dead on the floor. How long has she been dead?The cop has played every move smartly up until sending the evidence to the police which ruins the whole angleThe cop's brother ""won"" the game but then becomes the Front Man and then kills his cop brother? Why?How did Gi-hun know exactly where to find the girl's little brother?All winners presumably are allowed to go free. What stops them from uncovering this game conspiracy? If any of the past winners accumulated together, they could bring down the corporationIn the first instance, Gi-hun could have asked the cop to insert a tracking device on Gi-hun so when he went to the game the second time, the police could track his locationThere was no rule against crawling in the 6th game when they're crossing the glass. Two people can stand on one tempered tile while one person is crawling ahead. If the glass ahead breaks, the person with them (behind them) can just pull the person who starts falling by their legs and hoist them back upTo my knowledge, tempered glass doesn't shatter. It webs up as we see on a car's windshield. Even so, a huge chunk of glass hits the girl and she bleeds profusely which doesn't seem plausible at allThere are presumably 456 players when the games are starting. They could have easily constructed a human pyramid to reach the money inside the chamber. A few of them could have blocked the doors to stop the guards from entering. Alternatively, the players could have also overpowered the guards by their sheer number alone.Why didn't the cop trigger the bombs when he was escaping?When the cop sneaks into the van as a player, the guards are scanning the players behind their ears. What exactly are they scanning for?",5
East Asia,Seriously?8.3?The ending is absolutely illogical.,6
East Asia,"Solid drama with good story complexity and excellent character build up. Each episode is thrilling and heartwarming. Awesome series, one of the best series i have seen so far on netflix. Looking forward for Season 2.",9
East Asia,"It is one of the best shows that I have ever seen in my life. Interesting plot, great acting etc.",10
East Asia,Great to watch this series. The story was gripping and the acting was exciting... except for the VIPs who came in the last couple of episode. They could have done better.At times I felt that dialogues were a bit too long but you have to complete the time slot. The lead actors were great in their roles.,8
East Asia,One of the best kdramas ever. I will défini rewatch t many times.,10
East Asia,The show was epic!!!! But I want to know who sing that cover of fly me to the moon!!! I know that's not Renee olstead!!! Who is it!???,10
East Asia,"With a premise similar to the likes of Cube and Circle, the odd titled Squid Game helps us question humanity all over again as well as the importance society places on money.As dark and violent as Battle Royal and intriguing as 3% it grabs your attention early on and keeps you guessing to the end.Great binge worthy series with a likeable cast and main protagonist.Knocked off one point as I didn't love the ending but otherwise a really great TV series with some great ideas and worthy of top marks.Season 2? Personally I think it works better as a one off but then again...",9
East Asia,I'm so boreddddd. I'm on ep 3 or 4 and there's Only been one game what the heck? Lol. Hunger games was more riveting.,4
East Asia,"Decent set deco .Battle royal flavors.A bit long in runtime, especially after first half.Very bloody and gory at times.Addictive if thats your cup of tv tea.",7
East Asia,"Man! This show!Does everything right at the best times. Just when you forget some detail that would make you feel brilliantly smart, it comes back to whack you in the face!Like some of it's contemporaries it brilliantly fuses comedy and horror in the most psychological of way's and I must say, I really want more of this, and more like this.",9
East Asia,TBH THIS IS THE BEST KDRAMA IV WATCHED IN 2021. THE IDEA IS DIFFERENT FROM USUAL KDRAMAS. IT SHOWED US THAT THERE ARE MANY GREEDY PEOPLE THAT WOULD KILL AND BETRAY YOU FOR MONEY AND IT SHOWED HOW FRIENDS CAN SCARIFIES FOR EACH OTHER NO MATTER WHAT. I RLY LIKED IT AND I HOPE THERE IS SEASON 2 WHERE THE REVENGE FOR THE PEOPLE WHO DIED.,10
East Asia,Even if you're not a fan of dubbed over movies this will catch your attention. The story is incredible and messed up in a beautiful way.,8
East Asia,"I really didn't expect that much when I started to watch this serie. I finaly binged it and loved it. Got sticked in front of the screen. I really liked the scenario and the acting. A very surprising serie that I suggest you to watch. Be aware however, this is brutal visualy and emotionaly.",9
East Asia,"I started it with no boogers but it turned out to be amazing show. If you like Alice in borderland, you will like this for sure.",10
East Asia,Really enjoyed the series. Probably would have given it a 9...that ending though.,7
East Asia,I'm Korean and felt sorry for the poor translation. The frontman and other masked people all spoke Korean in a strange way. I think the director deliberately created a bizarreness through the horrible acting of people involved in the game including VIPs.,8
East Asia,"There are three types of human relationships that squid game characters have.Type 1. The relationship between Deoksu (101) and his gang to obey by power.Type 2. Human relationships (218 and 1), such as Sang-woo (218), Il-nam (1), that give others to benefit from human relationships (218 and 1) succeeded in society, are intelligent, and elite)
Type 3. Ki Hoon (456), Abdul Ali (199), sae byuk (67) and Ji Young (240) have pure trust (less social experience or unemployed)The best way to relate was to play the 4th game.A. saebyuk-Jiyoung, Deoksu-His subordinates were a team of the same type.Saebyuk and Jiyoung lived a difficult life as North Korean defectors and killers in society, but Jiyoung sacrifices for the saebyuk that opened her hand for the first time (Confrontation between Type 3)Deoksu and his subordinates usually work together, but they have no choice but to turn right away in extreme situations where they live only when they kill each other (Confrontation between Type 1)
Deoksu's betrayal by his subordinates before entering the squid game immediately shows how easy human relationships are to be betrayed in extreme situations.B. Abdul Ali-Sangwoo, Ilnam-Kihoon were a team of different types of people.In the confrontation between Abdul Ali (199) and Sangwoo (218), Abdul Ali trusts Sangwoo until the end, but Sangwoo betrays and wins (Type 2 wins against Type 3).Sang-woo (218) gives Ali Abdul a bus fare, but I think he has changed in the same way as Type 2 as he has experienced a loss if he acts like 199 while adapting to society.-Ilnam (1) and Kihoon (456) are people who have lived opposite lives even in their numbers.Il-nam (No. 1) meets and plays with people like Ki-hoon (No. 456), who already makes a lot of money and feels demonstrated in life as he grows old, and gives no return, and feels joy in pure human relationships.Ki-hoon (456) gives a favor to Il-nam (1) and impresses the writing so that Il-nam loses on purpose (Type 3 wins Type 2)Ilnam (1) is a successful person in life, and he has lived in Type 2 way, and he seemed to think that it was right.Social life, socially high command and a lot of income people who think we should act in ways such as type 1 or type 2.I think I've experienced that type of people win while playing squid for a long time.The scene that shows this appears in the scene where vip bet 101 or 218 times as a favorite.Ki Hoon (456) was a person who overturned all of the above thoughts.-VIP didn't pick Kihoon (456) as the favorite.In the final, when Ki-hoon (456) tried to give up the money without stabbing him, Sang-woo was moved by Ki-hoon and committed suicide by admitting that his beliefs lost to Ki-hoon.Ilnam(1) has lost his mindset while playing the game.He lost to the type of person he thought was stupid who had stepped on to get a high position throughout his life.The last time Ilnam called Ki-hoon to play the game in the last episode seems to have tried to discuss Ki-hoon's reversal of his thoughts for the last time.Kihoon (456) met Ilnam at the end and played a game, and asked Ilnam, ""I won now, right?""
While playing the squid game, Ki-hoon showed ilnam that his thoughts were wrong as a result, but Ki-hoon doesn't seem to know that he did.It was a series that allowed people to reconsider human relationships by showing that people like Ki Hoon, who give trust and favor in no return, beat others.",6
East Asia,"Best Netflix show I've seen for awhile. Had echoes of Spanish film The Platform (2019) and of course The Hunger Games films.Hard on their luck people pushed down and controlled by the top feeders of society, are approached to play a game to win the big bucks and get out of the current holes they have found themselves in.And what a thrilling edge of your seat ride this makes for viewing. Unknown masked dictators are hosting a game-show of sorts were the players (In debt everyday people) are desperate to win the cash even if it costs them their lives.Lots of twists and some deeper observations on humanity follow. Just a warning it's very violent and a bit trippy, so if that's not your thang obvs avoid. It also reminded me of the human sport elements in Eli Roth's Hostel and James Wan's Saw franchise so yes it's out there.Will become a future cult classic and Korean cinema is having a golden moment after masterpieces like Parasite and The Handmaid. Squid Game's hyper realism is pretty visionary stuff for Netflix's typically bland output. Fly me to the moon 8/10.",8
East Asia,"There is no deeper message here. It's just the same old tropes but packaged in very expensive production. It's the premise of Saw dialed up to a hundred, with the same shadowy cabal of puppet masters and wealthy elites making the poors kill each other for sport on widescreens that we've seen in endless iterations already in the last decade, like in Escape Room to name but one example. The show likes to present itself as more cunning and introspective than it really is, when at its core it is just mean-spirited schadenfreude pantomiming as societal critique.It looks visually very impressive, but it is so hollow and cynical that after the first few episodes it just feels like you yourself are being tortured by having to endure the never-ending meat grinder of despair. The cop's storyline is also so contrived, and induces some of the biggest eyerolls in an environment that is already straining the suspension of disbelief far beyond its maximum elasticity.So I guess watch this if you want to feast your eyes on some majestic set pieces and also if you hate people.",2
East Asia,"Everything works for me. The concept, the acting, the twist, the tone, the plot, everything.Superb.",10
East Asia,This show is absolutely amazing! You should definitely watch it.,10
East Asia,"First of all , lets appreciate the aesthetics and the colors of the movie.Now lets make it clear that this concept is not new , its very similar to ""Kaiji"" an anime series I really loved , I started to get flashbacks from ""kaiji"" specially when I saw the VIPs and the bridge scene . I don't mind the similarity because I really liked how the move started The first EP was perfect but after that it became a rip off of a great anime series like ""kaiji"" , The plot holes started from the police man when he sneaked under the car like how is that possible? , and then he passed all the security . How the hell there's no cameras everywhere , why they didn't put cameras in the bathroom and a lot of other small rooms, and the most ridiculous thing they didn't put cameras on the boss's room . A lot of minutes were wasted with that 'wanna be detective' police officer , I really hated him since I saw him and I was waiting for his death .",4
East Asia,"Squid game is what I can only describe as an evolution of the Battle Royale genre, what I mean by that is that you have a premise of putting x people into a deathmatch situation where only the best or luckiest individuals can get out alive. This heavily reminds me of Gyakkyou Burai Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor (Anime) and another movie called As the gods will, but this series did something quite unique and unthinkable which deconstructs many tropes and cliches.Honestly this is very well made, You get to feel for everyone's struggles and motivations to the point where it becomes relatable.I highly recommend you to give it a watch!",10
East Asia,"For me is the best Kdrama in Netflix. So refreshing, thrilled, gore at the same time. Is really mind blowing. 2 thumbs up for this drama!",10
East Asia,"My god!! Where do i even start? The whole series was on another level. I don't know how they managed to make every single minute thrilling and entertaining. I was about to watch few episodes now and rest later then ended up watching the whole series on one day and oh boy the subs were horrible i can pretty much understand everything on korean so i watched few episodes without subs cuz of how bad the subs were. Other than that another masterpiece by koreans, loved it from start to end.",10
East Asia,"First episode was great, then the story fell into emotional moments cliché, come on, at least not in second episode. What's going on? But gladly, the episode 3 was back to good, however my excitement didn't last. Since round 5 the game started to be boring, in fact the 4th game was already not so good, but round 5 was a new low, it is an unsuccessful copy from Kaji, the Japanese manga, and 16 players for 18 choices can be a dead end for the game, so they drag out a former glass worker to help them to finish the game, and at that point I found the show is overrated. And I was right, the final game is nothing but a boring friend-kill-each-other. After victory they made most of final episode to justify the season 2 and why protagonist want to join new game. OK, I got it, Netflix, season 2 is on the way.Btw, I realized 001 was too smart to be a loser at 4th round, just don't know he was the holder all the time. So, it isn't a big WTF moment to me.",6
East Asia,Superbly made. This is something different that was made with thought and passion. If I don't recommend it to others then I don't actually what's actually one should. Bravo!,10
East Asia,"The Squid game is probably one of the best shows I have seen in a long long time. It sure knows how to play around with the viewer's emotions. It will make you fall in love with some of the characters and then break your heart by killing them off in creative ways.Its a tough show to watch simply because you will be fully invested and immersed well enough into the story for it to make an impact on you.Great Character development - CheckPerfect Casting - CheckPerfect screenplay and progression - CheckA brilliant show that is a must watch, that will make you root for the characters, cry for them and generally start to question their morality, motivations and choices.And that's what the show is all about. The ethical choices we have to make just to be selfish, just to survive one more day in this cruel cruel world.I will not give away the plot but would instead implore you to watch the show by yourself and form your own opinions.",10
East Asia,"The TV show has an excellent thrilling and engaging premise. Blood and violence are spilt all over the show. The plot becomes more and more interesting as the episodes go. If you are into ""bloody games"" show, you will certainly like it.",9
East Asia,"Keeps you excited, interesting twists and turns throughout the series. And then, then one of the worst and ridiculous endings ever. Last episode destroyed somewhat decent series.",1
East Asia,"While some scenes were hard to watch.. this movie is jaw dropping, start to finish. I almost always can't seem to get into foreign films but Squid Game had me by my lady balls! It's uncomfortable yet staggeringly exciting. I feel almost guilty for saying that but it's a twist that I have never seen done within a movie. Hunger game, maze runner, none of those can compare. I want MORE!!!!",10
East Asia,"Hands down maybe the best show I have ever seen, can't stop thinking about it!",10
East Asia,Good The thing is they are stretching It out. Story and all things are good but The concept if a new one in the web series world.,9
East Asia,"I found it amazing through and through. Very emotional, I felt horrible during every episode but I kept watching and found the suspense amazing. Well done.",10
East Asia,Woow. Am shocked! Amazing sereies. Defined beauty.,10
East Asia,"The premise and aesthetic of the show had me hooked already. Lots of mystery. Love-able and hate-able characters. The ""games"" they play are always intense and you hope your favourites survive.It was quite emotional too, there's times where you have to be deceitful to your allies.Really great show all round. Although the VIP's had atrocious acting when they were introduced around EP 7. Really took me out the immersion for an episode.Other than that it was amazing, I love Korean shows and you don't get many on Netflix, so I hope the show does well so we see more.TL;DRIt's great, watch it.",8
East Asia,"Excellent show with incredible attention to detail on the psychology of different characters and how the relationships between these characters develop during the game. Definitely worth the binge in one night! The show is incredible in terms of scriptwriting AND acting and has an exciting unpredictability to it. Additionally, the soundtrack was brilliantly consistent and the repetitiveness helped tie all the episodes together.The only element in this show which was slightly worse was the acting of the VIP's from episode 7 and onward. They weren't too bad, but their acting was noticeably worse than the Korean actors.",10
East Asia,"This one kept me watching. Great characters. Interesting, if very dark story. I didn't find myself rooting for any single person. They were all flawed, damaged, even downright pathetic at times. Especially the ""protagonist"", which is a term I use very loosely here. He's not likeable. He leeches off of his mother, he takes money intended to buy a birthday present and dinner for his 10 year old daughter and gambles it away. Again, he wasn't likeable. But he was a well written character who at times I almost found myself sympathizing with, only for that sympathy to fade with another cowardly action.There is no objective good guy, with the closest one being the undercover cop, though even he acted questionably and reckless.Not every story needs a good guy though. I am fine with this. In fact, I applaud this series from breaking the ""hero of the story"" trope. Every single character seems to have a compelling reason for being where they are.In several ways, this series reminded me of Alice in Borderland, which I personally think was better written and one of my favourite series in this particular genre. Though this one was still a good series and well worth watching overall.Cue forward to the VIP scenes. As mentioned before, that could have been done much better. I don't know where they found these guys, but none of them were convincing. Their downright atrocious acting knocked down my rating by 2 stars.I can handle the occasional bad actor. I honestly don't mind when it's a single person in a role that isn't too important, but these VIPs filled the screen for far longer than their talent as actors should have permitted. Especially the old man with his 69 obsession. His lines were bad, his delivery, worse. Whoever he is, I hope that was the last time I saw him on a screen. He wouldn't have been out of place in Troll 2.I want to end this on a positive note. Honestly, the story was really good. The plot twist with player 1 is incredible and one I personally didn't expect, even if I had some suspicions. Towards the end, the main character has grown as a person and becomes someone I can almost respect. Which is quite an accomplishment on its own.But he should have gotten on the plane.",6
East Asia,I binge-watched this one. Every episode was so addictive and tense.All episodes were very emotionnal. Then we reached the conclusion and.... what a letdown. Huge anti-climatic ending.I would still recommend watching it.,8
East Asia,"The show's moral is ""the poor and rich are similar"". The poor being the good guys and the rich being the bad guys. As reasonable as the trope is, this one is executed terribly. Let's call is this a ""Game of Thrones"" ending: I was enthralled until the 7th episode and then it was garbage.",1
East Asia,The series was really interesting and entertaining till the last half an hour of the last episode. The ending is rubbish.,1
East Asia,"Wow he seemed clueless. And selfish before the game, then somewhat unselfish during, unless it suited him. But it would have been nice to have a smarter lead character.",8
East Asia,"The VIP's were, as many said before, horrible actors.",9
East Asia,"First it looked very exciting and fresh content for netflix shows, the first game was amazing but then the following games were quite boring except game 4. The stories about characters were SO BORING, i could not watch most of the storylines about them. The lines were too long and boring and unrelated as well. Police thing was very exciting but then what? He killed by his brother who is the manager of the games(!) and nothing clarified?? Who is he? Why is he the manager of the games? As a watcher, it did not give me the answers so it was a wasted storyline too. And i do not even wanna talk about VIPs and their lines...they were horrible. And the ending, why did you go back? What about your beloved daughter?what about your promises?Besides all of these bad comments, it was a unique show and some scenes were very exciting than i could not even blink. So if you wanna have some disturbingly beautiful and at the same time some boringness you can watch it :)",6
East Asia,Would give it 10 if it ended with an ending.Please don't ruin this with a second season.,8
East Asia,"WOW, there are so much twists, action, suspense, drama, and messages all packed in 9 episodes. It is hard to stop watching once you started. One of the best Netflix show ever. I really like the ending.",10
East Asia,I just came here to say that it worth every second.,10
East Asia,"This is a fantastic show through the 3rd episode. It is mysterious, it will tickle your sci-fi bone as well. It's gory so if you aren't into that pass on this. I love what Korea and Japan are producing right now!",9
East Asia,"You don't have to be a Korean drama fanatic to enjoy Squid game, it is great, the VIP team is lacking but otherwise everything else is just perfect............okay this isn't actually happening somewhere right ????????????, with the desperation for money currently in the world I wouldn't be surprised??",10
East Asia,"I could have done without the mandatory woke content from Netflix, as well as the nudity and useless profanity. This stuff brings nothing to the story. I started watching Korean shows because there is none of that, that is before Netflix started to produce content for this country. Other than that, good show and solid acting except for the vips, you know, the evil white men.",8
East Asia,"First of all, this show will gut you like a fish and use your soul for chum. It's ultra-violent, graphic, and so intense that sometimes I felt sick. I cried a few times but mostly I was just becoming as damaged as the contestants. This show will MESS. YOU. UP. It is hella dark, hella bleak, and once you start it, you won't be able to stop until you know who wins the game. I need Season 2, please.This is NOT Alice in Borderland!!! This is NOT The Hunger Games!!! This isn't Battle Royale.Yes, the same most basic of premise is there. But this show stands alone.Watch it at your own peril. But Watch It.",8
East Asia,"Very addictive. The most intense tug of war scene ever. This show will keep you curious, entertained and anxious the whole time. By the time the show is over you're left with a strange taste in ur mouth, mostly because the protagonist makes some very stupid choices that make no sense, this dude just keeps testing his luck assuming it will never run out. Anyways, this show runs back and forth from the depths of human depravity to the better angels of our nature. Definitely worth watching.",9
East Asia,"Many people talk highly of this show, so I had high expectation. It was good but some things made me disappointed. SPOILER ALERT. Too much plot armour for the police. How did he manage to infiltrate the place with so much security? And how lucky he is to be one of the recruit traitor and get the square mask? The Front Man said the biggest value of this game is equality, yet some participants manage to bring in some tools, and peek their game preparation. Ali lost because he got cheated, not through a legit game. So much for equality bruh. Sometimes the recruit is like not exist at all, they supposed to make sure all the participants play fairly. The last game was the most boring game. It's just like watching teenagers fighting pathetically. And the biggest thing that ruined the show is the ending. Gi-Hun suddenly become a high morale person, trying to catch the game organizer that he abandon his daughter! He was introduced as non responsible person, doesn't work hard, and love gambling, why he suddenly need to be so heroic??? He even cheated with the old man.",6
East Asia,"My score should be 8.5, but I will round it up.The bad:Questionable ending which is suggesting a season 2VIPs acting and visit purposePolice substory is lacklusterThe good:Well written and thrilling story inspired by multiple works in this genre, but piecing some of the best of each (Kaiji, Alice in Borderland, etc.)Different perspectives are brought to the table and the story allows the viewers to know a lot of the different characters.Original soundtrack matched the situation quite wellKR actors acting.",9
East Asia,"Regardless of the plot, subject matter, etc, this was overall some of thee best acting I've ever seen. Keep in mind I'm disregarding the VIPs lol. But this movie is making me feel things I absolutely did not expect at all going into this, lol. I feel ""truth"" from almost every main cast member. Honestly, it's a brilliant performance and, if it were a movie and shot to be a movie, I'd see it making waves in American mainstream similar to Train to Busan. A+++ to the actors, wow, the character arcs in this are awesome to watch.",9
East Asia,"Your eyes will stick to the series hours by hours. I cried, laughed, and feared at the same time. K-drama is always worth watching!",9
East Asia,"I'm sure by this time most of you have seen this series and I'm glad to have watched it as well the minute it came out in Netflix. For those who haven't, there are a lot of memes and clips showcased in FB and Tiktok..and in all honesty watching this is an absolute treat.We are all aware by now how Koreans can leave us in awe when it comes to the series or movies that they create. And Squid Game is an interesting and unique concept, something that left me fascinated until the end. Some may think that it is just a series with gruesome games involved, but frankly that is the part which makes it exciting like hell.Short but sweet as it only contained 9 episodes, and although the ending will keep us curious and wanting for more, it's enough for me to understand the plot and message it meant to deliver.Would you want a Season 2? I know I would.",10
East Asia,"I would give the set design for this series a ""10."" The rest of the show is not very good.Too much of the ""plot"" is obvious. You know the antihero main character will be the one to survive from the very beginning. You know the old man is behind everything because he's an anomaly and, unlike everyone else, has no reason to be in the game. Also, he's number 001, a real giveaway. You know there's some sort of relationship between the ""head man"" and the cop. You know the last game will be the ""squid game."" There are also other obvious things that come out in the first two episodes.The first episode is overlong; there's way more than the needed exposition to set up the plot to move on. The second through seventh episodes are the best, but there aren't many real surprises aside from the excellent set designs. The last two episodes are truly awful and boring. When the indefatigable cop ""disappears"" into the sea, you know that there will be a second season. But the final ending where the main character turns back from boarding the plane is really embarrassing; he might as well have held up a sign saying ""Be sure to watch Season 2.""All of the characters have the depth of comic book personae, especially the ""evil"" ones. The fact that none of them are believable characters wouldn't be a problem if the writers didn't try to create melodramatic moments when we're supposed to actually care about them and believe in their plights. No one in their right mind would leave hell and then let circumstances change their mind and therefore decide to re-enter a situation that leads to certain death.""Squid Game"" reveals many of the problems that plague most of Netflix's movies and series: They are bloated, overlong, and stretched-out in order to fill up a required amount of time. Even the very best of ideas can't sustain themselves indefinitely, and ""Squid Game"" is the umpteenth repetition of ""The Most Dangerous Game"" (1924) by Richard Connell. Combine this with Agatha Christie's ""And Then There Were None"" (1939) and you have the bases for many of the horror and adventure stories and films of the last 80 years. ""Squid Game"" doesn't add much that's new, besides some great set designs.",3
East Asia,"Best series of 2021. The series is very beautiful and interesting, a unique series, and the actors were excellent.",10
East Asia,"A really good series its only need better writing, think carefully about the quotes, for the next season it will be epic if it was in Spain with Spanish actors.",8
East Asia,A refreshing mixture of many genres to form a brand new standard!No spoilers here because this is one to watch and explore for yourself!I'd just say this much that I watched this by chance and been watching for 6 hours straight!Definitely one to watch!,9
East Asia,"This series was overated by viewer, try to watch this and Believe me this series was just typical korean movie. Too much drama. Like every korea movie, life conflict, problem blah blah...you expect this in any korean movie.",1
East Asia,"Most of Hollywood and almost every single(once beloved franchise) turned their backs on the customers. Too busy to lecture us and shove their woke religion down our throats but many other countries still make movies and series to entertain. To give us escapism, good story lines, thrills, believable characters with backgrounds and struggles, some who you despise, some who you care for, many of them grey and no political propaganda.No obvious message from the rich elite in Hollywood. No forced identity (with the exception of the elite watching the fights (poor acting, the sole downside of the movie) but real identities (e.g. Different characters).No all-powerful protagonists. Not total conformism. When a girl or woman fights a man it's believable and no preaching. I love it. No endless preaching from the hypocrites (which constantly pulls you out of the movie experience) but good 'le inventive and exciting entertainment.This is a high quality dystopian series from our Korean friends.If you are sick to the back teeth of modern day Hollywood sensibilities and microagressions like 95% of mankind then watch this macro aggression series. Highly recommended.",9
East Asia,"This Korean drama/series makes me remind of black mirror a lot because of the system of the game and the VIPs. I didn´t like how the VIPs talked because it seems they were reading... This serie talk about the things that someone is capable of doing to earn money, even kill the dearest person for you. Not everything it is what seems in this drama.",9
East Asia,"I applaud you for the work that went into a lot of balls and for trying a drama that is rare in Korea as a Korean. But on the other hand, there were a lot of cliché scenes that I felt like I had seen somewhere, and there were a lot of parts that I didn't understand why the story continued and dragged like that. It was not a series of plausible and shocking reversals, but a series of plausible deaths and deterrence. The script is disappointing.",4
East Asia,No doubt it is a one of the Best web Series. I recommend everyone to watch this.,9
East Asia,"Dystopia theme, cool aesthetics, and ""deep"" ideas do not automatically make something good!!!To be fair, Episode 1 is funny: slapstick and dark humour. And the overall concept, deadly games, is cool. But that's about it. This series is BADLY ACTED, BADLY SCRIPTED, and CRINGEWORTHY throughout.Over-acting makes it hard to take any *deep* conversation seriously.Many conversations are too long and unnecessary - as if the director's just killing time until the next game (the games seem to be the only thing he's good at.)There's some overly dramatic scenes that aren't built up to enough by the plot (e.g. Everyone tries to massacre each other in the night in episode 2 already - before they even got chance to start hating each other...).Many scenes are plain cliché/cringeworthy. Would YOU cry your eyes out at the death of the ""bad guy"" who's just murdered your lady? Cry and cry at your nemesis's death, because you're such a ""good guy""? Ridiculous.The final twists are unnecessary and annoying. I'd rather have seen some better quality acting and scriptwriting throughout.I could say more, but can't be bothered wasting any more time. I already lost 8 hours watching this - and 598 brain cells.",2
East Asia,Hey guys I'm karan and I belong to India and im 19 years old this series is great I like it all actors very good paforamce.,10
East Asia,"Positive surprise, we know long ago that there is no more creative movies or shows from US, everything is just copy paste zero creativity. This show was so unique and strange I really enjoyed it. It starts really slow and I almost gave up on it. But once the first game starts the crazy stuff starts happening.. great work guys !P. S to Netflix Bring back Real PRIME STAR TREK YOU MORON. S ! I will unsubscribe!",9
East Asia,"If you can get past the dubbing, this is a brilliant nail biter...unlike anything I have seen before...I would HIGHLY recommend.",8
East Asia,"Squid game has set an extremely high bar for other shows of this genre. It is intense. It is raw. It is an emotional roller coaster. This is a masterpiece throughout. I actually felt that the poor VIP acting was a good metaphor of modern Hollywood when compared to the incredible performances by some of the main cast members here. I sincerely hope they continue the series in the same style and it does not get the SAW franchise treatment.But Episode 6 - Gganbu.... So powerful. Possibly the best single episode of a show I have ever seen.More, more, more please.",10
East Asia,"For me, the first few episodes was a definite 8 in my books. But it started to be a bit boring and predictable in the last couple episodes. The glass game did not feel like an old children game. A new take on hopscotch perhaps. When the old guy appeared again at the end, I saw this coming, the second they showed the back of the head of The Host. This happened after Player 001 supposedly died in game 3. I was more surprised that I guessed right rather than his screen time in the final episode. Also I didn't get Frontman's motivation. He looked like the leader, but actually a yes man. He left his brother cop looking for him to be just that? A rich man yes man. Hmmm...so I did not understand this bit/character. I find a rather loose story about the brothers.Then we have Gi Hun With his decision at the end. He finally gets a chance to start over with his daughter, the one thing he wants more than anything else. Instead he went back for seconds. No wait, thirds. I guess setting the narrative this way opens the possibility of a season 2.I get the high ratings and hype, but beneath it all its a not-too-bad series worthy of a 6.",6
East Asia,"This series is mind blowing. Fast paced thriller action, I haven't blink my eyes during whole series.",10
East Asia,"10/10 great tv series, must watch unlike any other series you watched/",10
East Asia,"You get into in at first but then it gets very slow, too many conversations, and it moves so slow you get tired of watching. Fast forwarded half of season. Could've been much better.",5
East Asia,After long i get master piece from korean web series bt only disspointment is vip s role.,10
East Asia,"This film try too hard to be another Parasite but fail in many way.About the battle royale, main character is way too useless from the beginning to the end. He contributed almost nothing to the game. His arc is just too simple, nothing significant changed. The games are designed simple and pure by chance most of them. It required nothing smart or outstanding physical.The VIP and bad guys are stupid as heck. Who write those characters ?The plot twist is not that twist anymore since you can easily guess it. Who haven't seen that classic horror movie franchise ?There are a lot of better movies out there in battle royale or social issues. This one does not earn its score.",6
East Asia,You love characters who are good and you actually hate those who are bad. It's that good. Ignore the VIP!!!!,9
East Asia,This show has it all. The English dubbed version is a bit cheesy but it's acceptable. The show itself is gory so if that's not your thing don't watch. It is heart wrenching. I wasn't expecting this.,9
East Asia,"This show sucked me in on the first episode. The acting is superb and the plot is great. The only issue is the VIPs, that's where the acting is bad and writing fell apart. Luckily the VIPs are only in one episode so it doesn't ruin the entire series. I binged this on Netflix after watching one episode. Hoping for a season 2.",9
East Asia,"I absolutely love this show, the story is great, character development, and basically everything keeps you interested in it. I'd say the first 2 episodes aren't as good as the following 7, but that's part of the good stuff. There are many plot twists that blew my mind, and I will defo watch it again <3Something that really made me ""cringe"" were the VIP's. Their scripts didn't feel natural enough and this is something that happens in almost every K-Drama or any Korean movie; they try and force Americans/foreigners in the movie and their scripting is just not good.",9
East Asia,"Fun series, but lacks the psychological complexity and extreme levels of suspense we know from Kaiji. That said, Kaiji I was so intense I had to pop a couple Xanax while watching it to keep from having a panic attack.Squid Game isn't Kaiji, but the productions looks nice and it's entertaining enough. The narrative relies on well-established tropes, making the story highly predictable. You will probably guess the ""twist"" at the end very early on. So watch Squid Game if you are looking for an afternoon of light entertainment, just don't expect it to explore any uncharted territory.If you were hoping for something a bit more psychological, but without the unfettered intensity of Kaiji, then check out LIAR GAME. I like really enjoyed the 2014 Korean remake with Lee Sang-yoon.",7
East Asia,"Just binged season, i was hooked after the second episode.After seeing the vip's i went looking for some reviews. Boy... the acting was so out of place. It felt so weird, upon the VIP encounter the acting was really good. It kinda breaks the whole atmosphere.Nevertheless definitly worth watching.",8
East Asia,Besides a few bits of bad acting this series was very entertaining.??,9
East Asia,Devastatingly perfect. This level of gorgeousness should not be possible. Shakespearean in stature. Prepare all your human emotions for a descent into the core of the human condition.,10
East Asia,"I was engrossed! Very interesting story and characters UNTIL the last episode. I just could have done without the boo hoo blah blah sentimental ""here is why"" explanation. I believe that was obvious. The most worthy of friendships in the game was ruined for me in the last episode.It's worth a go. It teaches age old lessons again but it's always worth learning them, again.",7
East Asia,"Just don't count on cops for real, when comes to a situation like this. They get paid monthly and they are hired by the goverment. They don't know you. Count on yourself and your community which is organic. Asians need to grow up and seek for help from anything other than a strong government.",8
East Asia,"One of the best series i have ever watched in my life (and i watched a lot!).However that VIP acting was the most rerrible acting i have ever seen in my life. Terrible.On the contrary everything else about the serieswas top notch quality. Acting? 10. Screenplay? 10 Director? 10 Camera angles? 10
Game rooms? 10/10.",10
East Asia,"Absolutely fabulous! Truly fabulous. I was terribly bummed to read so many reviews that claim the subtitle translation was bad; as an English-only speaker, proper translations are paramount. I never watch English language dubs as they are horrible compared to watching (and hearing real characters voicing their parts) in the original language with the subtitles on.In all honesty, this likely would have been a '10' had it not been for some slow areas in episodes 1, 2, & 9. That's not to say that they were bad, but there is a necessity for backstory that is handled in these episodes (or post-story, re: ep9) and to me there were some wasted opportunities. Nonetheless, the show is definitely binge worthy. I went through it in two days and am hopeful they'll do another season.Extremely well produced, a super cool mix of fantasy, action, and drama with a novel story line. But hey...what's up with Lee Byung-hun not being credited in IMDB for his cameo as The Frontman? I get that the ""walking around"" character didn't need to be Byung-hun, but it was such a surprise to see his face behind the mask that he needs to be credited.",9
East Asia,"This is the best ""Death Game"" / ""Battle Royal"" type of show I've seen in years. There are a dime-a-dozen of these shows in the anime / Japanese world and Squid Game is the best one in a long while. What's usually wrong with these shows is that they have a super natural element (gods, aliens) to them or outrageous reasoning as to how or why these games are evening taking place. That and the general writing is kind of ... well ... awful ... since these shows are usually about mass killing and the sick ways contestants have to be punished rather than concentrating on the actual characters.It's the well written character dialogues and backgrounds that keep you hooked, not the senseless violence on screen. Squid Game understands this. The best episodes are the ones with no direct violence to them. They will crush you.In other shows ""aliens"" or what seems to be literally a handful of people are running the whole thing. That's not good enough for me. Squid Game keeps it simple. Humans (a lot of them actually) run the show, and humans kill each other. I really appreciate the logistical side of the show, it keeps it grounded.As for the negatives, there is a small subplot involving a doctor that's really not that relevant to the show. Later in the season there's a group of people that you'll encounter and they are horribly acted. You'll notice it immediately when you get to it. Otherwise, amazing show, hope for another successful season 2 in the future.",9
East Asia,"Loved this series and how it kept me hooked until the very end. The very last game and conclusion were rather mediocre and was a cheap method at opening up the doors to a Season 2, but everything up until that point were a clear 9/10.If you love competitive death game/escape room movies/shows, this is one you should not pass on.",8
East Asia,"Humans vs humans is a no brainer for writers. Be it Hunger Games, 13, The Hunt, or Surviving the Game, I as well as others, for what ever reason, are going to watch...in spite of the quality.My first concern was the acting, not the actors ability, but them acting like Koreans. Are Koreans usually this giddy and overly reactive in certain situations? The main character at the horserace or with his daughter was uncomfortable to watch, but it could be it didnt translate well. As for the VIP, a lot of criticism has been on their acting, but does it matter since the Korean version would have translated there words for them? If so, they could have been spouting gibberish and the subtitles for the Korean audience would have remedied that easily.As with the aforementioned films, this one lacks a punch ending. Writers just dont seem to find a ending that is as strong as the beginning. The last game had none of the emotional power and cleverness of the prior ones. The 5th left something to be desired also, except to resolve an issue between two characters.I suffered through all of my criticisms, and you should as well. It is just such a strong idea, wish someone could deliver an ending.",6
East Asia,"It was fun, but the show falls back on usual Korean story tropes (ie forced deaths to make ""cool"" sacrifices) , the acting by the VIPs was so laughibly bad and cringy that it almost tanked the whole show, and some stuff is stupid and makes no sense at all.Examples (spoilers!)1. The players keep acting like they can win the game together and get out of there together with the money, again and again. It's made 100% clear that they either can't stop playing until one person is left alive, or they can end things with a majority vote but then don't get the money. No one ever mentions this again or acklowedges that anyone they bond with will die if they want that money.2. They all left the game and then choose to come back, knowing the above... but a husband and wife joined again. They tried to make it a shocking and surprising thing that this poor couple are made to face each other to the death, but by choosing to come back they knew that one of them would have to die. Really dumb!3. The first time when they quit they say the accumulated money will go to the families of the deseased. When they return that money is still in the piggy bank and they continue from where they left off.4. The missing brothers stuff is in the goshiwon and it seems like rent was skipped for a month, so the cop brother says he will pay the rent and looks through his stuff, goes looking for him because of that card. Later we see in a file that he won the game years ago, and it seems he's been working as the front man for a good long time too. Um...didn't he just go missing recently?4. They gave my fav character a super cheap death. Cmon, random exploding glass took her out? She's there to play the games and no one notices she's been impaled or offers some medical attention so she can compete still...when they say it's all fair? How did they know there damn stupid exploding glass trick would not take everyone out and end the games by mistake? It was just a set up for that 3 in the sleeping area with knives scene, but was too forced.5. They took all interest and moral dilemma out if the ending by neatly killing off everyone, keeping the good guys hand s clean, and making the other guy a clear villain.6. The main character gets stabbed twice in the final fight but carries on fairly easily, but the other guy gets bit in the foot and that's it...becomes completely defenseless after that. The whole ending after that was very forced.7. The red hair thing was a little stupid. As was the case off money for the old lady and child - looks cool but how is she gonna use that or explain it when putting it in a bank? Her son is missing for fraud and the cops already visited her. In the same vein - him becomg a sudden multibillionaire didn't attract any attention from the tax office?8. When he got off the plane at the end: we went full circle and killed the character development because the last thing he does is impulsive, prob gonna get him killed (no way he can take on this shadow group with red hair and some cash - he's easily dead) and he lied and failed his daughter. Again.9. They didn't tie off a few things. The Morse code thing went nowhere if I'm not mistaken. The guy didn't do anything to get that mom back from N Korea.10. Also, cop guy infiltrates stupidly easily - and his iphone battery life is AMAZING. No way there's a charging cable laying around in a facility were no phones are allowed. Even Mr head honcho has to use a land line.11. Will normal people playing games really randomly all out try to kill each other at night? They say they provide less food to stoke tension, but there was enough for everyone if that group didn't cut in line for seconds. No way they'd know that would happen. And it certainly wouldn't guarantee a bloodbath. It's normal people in debt, not hardened criminals (apart from the one guy).And that's about what I remember. It was fun, but a little stupid too. It started very strong and could have been GREAT, but the writing needed tightening up and less reliance on formulaic tropes.",7
East Asia,I'm watching this on Netflix and with the dubbing it's like watching an anime.,7
East Asia,One of the best shows I've seen in a long time. Acting was pretty good and the story and plot were crazy.,10
East Asia,I m speechlesss. Love this series.. One of the best.,10
East Asia,Honestly Netflix can not make many good American shows without a bunch of woke politics and other trash. This show is god damn amazing!!! Its so dark and twisted.,10
East Asia,"A fantastic tale of a group of humans, laden with debt, play games in the hope of winning cash prize.Great acting, interesting plot glues you to the series, from start to end.This is not just another play a game of death story.Squid game definitely raises the bar on drama and story telling.",10
East Asia,"Ep.2 & 6 are easily the top tier episodes. They built tension and characters right. It's a great story. Easily ""A"" tier series until..... The ending.YES, Great story telling, the tension and flow and ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS TO STICK THE LANDING RIGHT and it FAILED. Resulting into a dragging episode and an 8 episodes wasted. I also have to mention ep.4 "" Rumble at night/ lights turn flashing"" scene, it's a bad idea filming against the light or in a dark area, let alone filming with flashy lights (hahahah). It's an unspoken rule but important, I nearly puke and I didn't know what is going on at that scene. That scene is bad but not as TRASH as the ending. Still, I enjoy the series but the ending makes me feel I wasted a cry at episode 6. And BTW, VIP's = CRINGE.",7
East Asia,"This is fantastic! I watched the version dubbed in English, and it felt natural, not forced. Such a cool story, each episode is exciting and good fun. People have said they don't like the VIPs acting, but I think it's appropriate for those characters to have no real depth, they're supposed to be superficial people. Have a watch for an ace fun series, I watched the lot over a couple of nights :D.",10
East Asia,"Fly Me to the Moon
Let me play among the stars
Let me see what spring is like on
A Jupiter and Mars
In other words, hold my hand
In other words, baby, kiss meNow imagine listen to that calming jazz melody, sipping some wine, and watching more than 400 people getting murdered playing some kid's games.A brand new Netflix Korean thriller. This is kinda like Korean version of Alice in Borderland. However, the twist to the familiar premise was amazing. Most of the games were incredibly nerve-racking. The first and fourth games were for sure my favorite. They made me grabbing my pillow, while showing cruel ways desperate people resorted to do to save themselves. Because of this, whenever the game started, I became excited and more thrilled.However, the characters were for the most part generic and categorical. Honestly I didn't care much for them, and just wanted the games to start. However, some of them actually had some sad stories, like the two girls in game number four. Then, near the end there's these English-speaking VIPs that were annoying as heck mostly because of the unnatural way they talked. I'm not sure why they had to speak like they are the final bosses. There's also a subplot about a cop, which didn't pay off well enough at the end.Overall, despite the straightforward characters, I still had an amazing time with this show. Pretty sure season 2 will be made because not everything was resolved. 8/10#**THIS PART IS SPOILER SO STOP OF DON'T WANT SPOILER**Well of course, game 4, the marble games, was the best one because the stuff that the characters pulled to fool the others were sad and shocking. Then game 1, red light green light, was shocking and fun. Probably the most nerve-racking one out of all of them. Then game 5, the jumping glass, was also intense as heck. Game 2 wasn't as intense, but still bloody. When it was revealed, I and the main guy realized how screwed he was. Then game 3, tug of war was fine, but the tricks were pretty surprising. Gotta equip those tools. Finally, game 6 was lackluster and didn't have as much impact as I wanted. It was over a bit too quickly and didn't feel special. But yeah, that's my ranking of all the rounds in this first season.",8
East Asia,"I liked Squid Game, it's refreshing to watch something of this genre besides all the overload of romcoms and other shallow programs that are offered. The camerawork, settings, acting is wonderful (minus the foreign VIPS, oh my god I really hope Korea stops casting those wannabe caucasion actors, cuz they can't act even if their life depends on it, cringe level 1000!)A few minus points: the white actors (VIPS) as mentioned above. Also, the pace is really slow. And A LOT of things were very predictable. Sometimes I was just plain bored, and that isn't a good thing if it's a thriller/suspense genre series, right?Overall there were somewhat interesting characters and a few good moments about bonds, but still, there was something lacking. I wasn't shocked or on the verge of tears when someone died or when a emotional scene happened. Also, the main character was unlikable. He showed a great ethic belief during the games, but then he didn't show much growth (after the games he's still a good for nothing loser).Alice in Borderland on the other hand, has more fantasy elements, but a fast pace combined with unusual turns of events that makes you really sit on the edge of your seat.Last, but not least: please watch it in the original audio (Korean) with subtitles. DON'T watch it dubbed. Don't be lazy cuz you'll have to read subtitles, because firstly, it's not a big deal, and secondly, you'll miss so much emotion, humor and whatnot if you watch dubbed versions (of anything, really). SUB > DUB.",8
East Asia,"I'm Korean, and people around me kept telling me to watch this show so I decided to try it. Definitely exceeded my expectations. It brought much more emotional attachment that many Western shows, and I liked how the show wasn't very predictable. For example, I loved OBX but it felt a little repetitive to the point I started watching it more for the characters than the plot itself. However, this show really did well in terms of both the character development and plot.Also, I've seen reviews saying the Netflix subtitles were inaccurate. But idk, I thought it was well written (as a bilingual person) I loved the dubbings too bc the voices really matched.Lastly, to address the VIP scene, many people said they were poor actors and had cringe lines.I think the lines embodied the American culture pretty well for a Korean crew. At this point, yall should be thankful it wasn't worse. Also, since not a lot of foreigners live in Korea, it would have been difficult to pick up actual actors for the show.",10
East Asia,"First off, I wanted to give this show a 7-star rating. As many other comments say, the horrendous, cringeworthy casting of the VIP's drag this down a star in itself. It literally ruined a whole episode. It almost seems surreal just how bad they are at acting.Apart from this though, the show is very gripping with a great idea behind it. Had the idea been executed to perfection, this should would easily be a 9, and maybe even 10. I'm not a big fan of the extreme acting that's often practiced in Korean movies, and this isn't any different. The actors play well, no doubts, but sometimes it's just too much.Scenery, camera-work and story is all pretty well done.But really, what makes this series unique and worth watching is the idea behind it. No matter if you like the korean film-style / acting, you should definitely give this one a watch - you won't regret it.",6
East Asia,"Great plot, great acting, and all around great show. One of the best series I've seen on netflix in a very long time. Korean cinema is absolutely the best with their story telling. 10/10!!",10
East Asia,The best K Netflix Series I've seen recently.Hope they will release season 2 and 3 and moreeeee!!,10
East Asia,"For those who did not understand the psychological projection of the series. Basically, The series discusses the brutality of the capitalist economy system in such a clever way that you'll definitely notice and say when you're watching ""that character is me!"".It is that under the dominance of the capitalist system all people are in a race to get money that only one person takes in the end. The same money that come from the blood and sweat of others.The capitalist system claims that there is equity And justice in the distribution of the wealth. And this is far from the truth.As for the big capitalists who control the big capitals and companies that run the entire process, money is no longer their pleasure. That they only find pleasure in people suffer.",8
East Asia,Got sucked in immediately by all of it. Was blown away by the performances too. Each actor does an incredible job. I too was derailed by the VIP characters' dialogue.,9
East Asia,This is a hard movie to watch but something that could happen in real life too. Good acting by the main characters.,9
East Asia,"It is quite hard to review the whole series . Because each episode gives a unique portrait .The idea is good old fashion Japanese way with some new modern technology. The main concept is well demonstrate. My best moment is at the last one, when the main hero and a old man playing games weather the homeless guy will get help or not.The rich see the world in another sense. But the life goes on inhuman way towards the poor people. This series gives some visual, good concept , business and class exploitation with Japanese work culture. Among 9 episode the 3 episodes are good. Over all good for nice time pass.",6
East Asia,The story line is way too predictable and there are too many plot holes. 5 stars are for Hoyeon .,3
East Asia,Not original at all but refreshing to see this theme played by good Corean actors.Apparently the gender and bla agenda is not a must for Corean series. Which is fine by me.,6
East Asia,"The story of the police officer was just pointless. He achieved nothing, other than killing like 2 random people.",7
East Asia,"The storyline is familiar. We have seen this before. From the original Battle Royale to the Hunger games, and the most recent Alice in Borderland.What makes the Squid game stand out is definitely the character development of the main characters. You got to know them, you hate them, you feel sorry for them, you love them;+ Great acting from the actors and actresses.+ I like the games, not complicated but simple recognizable games.+ different from others we got an undercover police man in the staff of the game. This was refreshing to see the other side and not only focusing on the characters in the game. And the guy who is playing the undercover is an eyecandy to watch.Less enthusiastic about:some predictable plots, like the main character will survive till the end.somehow I knew the frontman was the brother of the undercover police man, but why and how did he end up as the frontman?-the VIPS, please delete their part. Terrible fake acting.the final episode, of course they finish with the squid game, but It was not so excited like the previous games. Also towards the end was disappointing.Fun factThe main character resembles Hong Kong actor Sean Tam.",9
East Asia,"An outstanding piece of Korean Television drama. If you can see it with the subtitles and not the dubbed version, do so. As others have said the dubbed version is atrocious.This literally is as I have described above. A motley group of Koreans are given the chance to compete for a huge cash prize in a fierce competition where the soon find out to lose means death.Nearly 500 competitors are plucked from all walks of society to take part. What do they all have in common? Poverty or huge debts or both. The eclectic bunch of men and women complete some times against each other and some times in small teams on a string of games which soon sees their number dwindle to a few dozen.While we focus on a few key characters, some of whose lives have collided outside of the game, there's various subplots including one very improbable narrative about organ trafficking. Where the show is strongest, is simply when it focuses on the games themselves and the moral dilemmas the characters have to face. (One man is forced to kill his wife in one round, although several of my school mates would tell you that is a good thing)There are some stand out performances from the ensemble cast, inventive production design and excellent visuals.I don't want to say more for fear of spoilers. Definitely worth your time.",8
East Asia,"A breath taking series
A game of wealthy and pain through pleasure beasts in human form, against desperate people for money...
Betting their precious lifes just for one to take the price and get out alive
Would you play?Watch it now!!!",9
East Asia,Far too long for a plot that only stole some ideas from Cube or Saw. Poor acting and boring dialogues. Please avoid this one!,4
East Asia,.... And it'll do its job. The games gave me anxiety and goosebumps. Definitely worth watching a few episodes at a time.,10
East Asia,"I didn't want to watch this because the thumbnail on Netflix looked like cheap Money Hiest rip off. The trailer had me little intriqued but I've had my fair share of battle royale. Then I watched it and I am so glad I did.This isn't just a rip off of Battle Royale, Hunger games or Alice in Borerlands. This series speaks of the lives, desperation and morality of poor people vs the rich and their filth. Almost as if it was inspired by The Parasite. It's not the first time we have seen the wealthy bet on the poor but this time it's executed well. The deep dive into different characters and their plight really works here. This time it's not just the players but we get to peek into staff and leaders too. The motive makes sense. It's not just filthy rich making poor fight.I liked how they took the childhood games and put a deadly spin on it. When it gets dark it really does get dark. I had a couple of people I was rooting for. My favorite character is player 001. I instantly fell in love with his character and almost all the scenes he is in, are delightful to watch.All the actors have done great job. There are characters you hate, some that are just so annoying you wish they were dead, heroes, faux heroes, unfortunates, unlucky. Technically this movie is well made violence and gore is not gratuitous. Twists are well written, editing could've been tighter, cinematographer captures the South Korean streets and lives well enough, background score was okay. Humor is well knitted.This is a must watch on Netflix. I doubt there will be a season two and there isn't any scope of it.",8
East Asia,"This is a must watch. It speaks for itself. It's violent yes, but the characters are alive with plenty of personality. Pure quality. Perfect storyboarding and addictive. Yes, the weakest part is the WIPs but the rest is perfect.",9
East Asia,"My first Korean TV series I have seen all episodes. Wao I love it like there are violence scenes that go over the border, and good stories of rich and poor, what money do to people in difficult times in life.",8
East Asia,"This show start amazingly thrilling, until the fourth game this show became predictable and the characters are overacting, unlike the VIPs their acting make me cringe to the bone.The fourth game was great tho, Ali's innocence face got me, seo-byeok and ji-yeong friendship, Il-nam the old man (and we found out that he is the founder of the squid game), and the policeman finally met his brother and he's dead like for what?Lastly, the ending, the ending was too long and boring.",7
East Asia,"I've never watched a series like this before. From the characters behavior's stand due the game time to pains in their civil life is effect your brain in the existential sense way. They show us mankind could do everything for some stupid piece of paper with a small games that we played in our childhood. On the other hand as the games progress, you witness other games played behind the scenes and the taste of the series starts to get better. Omg! I don't want to give you spoiler! Just watch it. I hope the second season will airs.",8
East Asia,"Beginning was amazing. However, the sanctimony and dreariness of the main character made it increasingly more difficult to watch. Kang Sae-byeok, for example, would've made a far superior main character. Then, VIPs we're utterly disappointing. What was even the point of Jun Ho, other than being a filler?! Also, this secret organization kidnaps and murders 456 Koreans annually in a very short and specific period of time, yet no one ever notices? Altogether, the concept has potential, but the obvious threads to Saw franchise and insufferable main character just didn't do it for me.",5
East Asia,"Seriously. All things considered, they're a pretty small and self-contained part. The main characters were brilliant in their roles. I guess good actors figured that having parts where they're wearing masks the whole time wouldn't get them much exposure. The pacing and character development were superb.",9
East Asia,"What a treat ! Edgy, emotional. Above all ? Disturbing. I wasn't expecting much to be honest. Oh boy was I wrong.Nicely produced, almost perfectly executed. You feel the tension from start to finish. The actors are are spot on (apart from the VIP's in episode 7).You feel and want to know more about them.This is how good it is.Have a go, you won't regret it.Pure entertainment.",9
East Asia,"Been an avid reader and viewer of several survival games, thriller and suspense series, this series is so predictable and draggy it really feels painful at some points. A 1 minute dialogue can get dragged to a 10 minutes dialogue with simple shouting, gesturing and lots of unnecessary activity.Even though the premise is supposed to be on the real world, it is seriously not realistic. Too much plot armor, plot holes, character personality inconsistencies, unexplained events and so on. It's basically for people who like plot twists but do not think whether it is consistent or reasonable. But one thing holds true, plot armor is stronger in this series than most of the ludicrous manga/ anime/ K-drama/ movie etc. Etc. Series I have seen.As I was browsing around, I found an article saying that the initial inspiration for Squid Game came from an unnamed comic book. Ahh, now I see why. It's basically a typical death survival game plot but heavily tweaked to reflect South Korean culture (unaccepting of foreigners, high household debt, the belief that women are inferior to men etc.And that is why the storyline is inconsistent, choppy, have plenty of plot holes and plot armor in a lot of sections. Because the production crew does not let its characters tell a story, and there was much ""micromanagement"" in order to produce the desired results.It could have been much better, but it's really boring from Episode 6 because it suddenly became incredibly inconsistent, which also made it incredibly predictable. This is where the ""micromanagement"" starts being especially prominent.Overall, it started out great, but went downhill quickly, especially from episode 6.Oh, and Squid Game is a clickbait title. I guess the production crew wanted to draw interest to traditional South Korean games eh? Maybe this film is partly an introduction of South Korean childhood games and social culture to the world. Even the North-South Korean dispute was touched upon, but more in the sense of the difficulties of the detractors.In summary, too much agenda, too little plot.",3
East Asia,Squid game is a conventional drama which is dipicted on living experience of human being addicted to capitality. The various games in the drama is showing a testimony that people are living for.People.,10
East Asia,"First of all, I'll talk about what I like! The concept is great, it drags you in and makes you want to binge the show right until the end, the art direction is also fantastic, taking what is essentially a very dark subject matter and giving it a child like aesthetic is very jarring but in an enjoyable way.Characterisation has its ups and downs, the main protagonist is initially presented as a dead beat who steals from his own mother to gamble, but through small actions you get the full picture that while he's a bit of a waster, he has a heart of gold.Other characters not so much, there's an edgy North Korean female character who's lines made me genuinely cringe. ""I don't trust people"" is one of the lines that stuck out for me, I dislike when a character has to state one of her character traits to let the audience know it is in fact one of her character traits.The dubbing is also awful, I don't know who was in charge of it, whether is was Netflix themselves or a 3rd party but it's woeful, like really bad.I'd still recommend the show though, it's an enjoyable watch regardless of its flaws. 7/10.",7
East Asia,"This series is one you have to stick through, I did want to turn it off because it took a while to get to the point, but I'm glad I didn't. Only thing I was not a fan of was the VIPs, they're very unnecessary and could have been left out. Other than that, it is put well together and detailed. I enjoyed it.",8
East Asia,"Those of you complaining about the VIPs are completely missing the point. This show is so damn clever. The VIPs are meant to be over the top, gaudy, and obnoxious. They're representing the type of rich, entitled aholes that enjoy this kind of entertainment. These are the same guys that would set up a game of hunting for humans. Fantastic show.",10
East Asia,"Poetic yet Gruesome, the story shows the harsh reality of the world through a fictional series, modern slavery. They director succesfully make the audience to have roller coaster of emotions: suspense,relief,grief. They also give attention to small details that made the story truly brings out. The actors also played their role really well, enough that bond were built between the audience and the actors.",9
East Asia,"This is the first Korean Series I have ever watched and I am glad I gave it ago.Lee Jung-jae (Seong Gi-hun #456) made this show for me. Given the fact he is the main character given the responsibility of capturing the audience during the initial introduction, he gave an amazing performance throughout the series.The show itself is a nice mix a gripponh dramatic thriller but with a slightly comedic element that wasn't forced. I liked the way you got a sense of background for each of the main characters. No doubt the costumes and symbolism is going to be iconic. So credit to Hwang Dong-hyuk for coming up with this concept.I think the performance of Anupam Tripathi (Abdul Ali #199) should also be commended. For a Korean Series to achieve such diversity in a show was great and he played his role to a tee.So all in all well played Korea and your spot at the top of many charts is quite an achievement. I gave it an IMDb 9, however really its a 10/10 from me.",9
East Asia,"The switch from game to Vip lost my suspense a bit, as well as the Vip's couldn't act.But other than that an amazing nail biting show with amazing sets and actors.",10
East Asia,One of the greatest shows I have seen in years. The VIP actors ruïned some parts unfortunately.,9
East Asia,"This was well written, acted, executed. VIPs played their role. I don't know what people wanted from their screen time. Overall great show. Some scenes felt drawn out from time to time, but other than that. Great show.",9
East Asia,Loved it. Hooked from the start. Well done! Hope there is a season 2!,10
East Asia,"It's one of the best series I have seen in my life
The VIPs give some boring scenes to the show
But it still the show is 100% worth watching
If you have a good heart
I watched it in 1 day.",9
East Asia,"Just binge the whole 9 episodes
And I will probably say it is one of the best series you will look after
The VIPs give some boring scenes to the show
But the show is still 100%worth
If you have already watched Parasite and loved it this series is for you
I will not recommend you this series in only one condition if you don't have a powerful heart.",9
East Asia,"Guys.How can this show even be hyped ?It's easily in my top 5 of the worst series I've ever watched. I'm totally not kidding. I wasted 9 hours of my life for this trash, just to understand why people like it. And I don't get it. It's bad. It's more than bad. It's boring, it's predictable.And I'm not even talking yet about the absolute ridiculous acting.100% trash - at least for people with a little claim in good series. Trust me...",1
East Asia,"What I loved most about this show is the acting was fantastic (with the exception of the white VIPs - they were terrible actors - perhaps on purpose), the backstories were believable and heart wrenching, and the suspense was very real. This wasn't violence for the sake of violence. I found myself rooting for certain characters and I was invested in the storytelling. The ending also didn't disappoint. One of the best Netflix shows I've seen. Very much looking forward to season 2. Also, viewing tip: don't watch with English voices dubbed over. Do the subtitles. It feels more real and genuine. You really get a sense of emotion in the voices.",8
East Asia,"Good basic idea...
Being a big fan of battle royal, I was immediately attracted by the pitch of the series. But in the end, the series turned out to be a little too predictable in my opinion. It's not bad but I expected better.I also expected more ""gore"" scenes. So... Not bad, but I expected much better.It must be said that for me Battle Royal is almost ""unbeatable"" in the genre :)",5
East Asia,I totally love it so i will give it 10/10. A s a matter of fact all actors were incredible in their acting but the vib were not.,10
East Asia,"The acting, and graphic was good, the cast's acting me have no complain at all, its awesome, me love it.But, how about the story? Well, I would say the whole story was good, but there is some part that confusing, there is a lot of detail that need to be explained, I hope they explain the details in next season.",6
East Asia,"This show is so well made. From a technical standpoint, it's shot beautifully and in a way to differentiate itself completely from other shows with similar tones. The lighting, the sets, the costumes, the locations, all fantastic!The idea is great! Most things made sense both story-wise and character-wise. There were a few moments that were questionable when it came to character decisions but it's very easy to look past those as the majority of Squid Game was fantastic. The entire second episode was pretty much dedicated to really making it clear to the audience WHY these characters would subject themselves to such a game and it's done in such a way where it's all very believable.I imagine there is, as always, some errors with Korean to English translation as some of the dialogue (in subtitle form) was incredibly on the nose and structured in a way where people simply don't talk that way but once again, it's easy to look past as the show is so interesting throughout and enjoyable.It felt more like a 9/10 hour movie, rather than a series as each episode flows so seamlessly into the next and carries the momentum, especially when binge watching.Highly recommended.",7
East Asia,"Pros: acting, art direction, visuals, detailed storytelling
Cons: filler scenesWith more than a decade in making, Director Hwang Dong-hyuk has nailed this series, possibly allowing for more Korean creators to explore this genre.The acting by many of the characters in the show has been phenomenal. Their backstories were believable and emotional because of the emotions they conveyed (if being watched with original Korean audio + English subtitles, instead of English dub).The artistic design throughout the movie was aesthetically pleasing and creative as color choices in many scenes are intentionally done. And with that being said, the attention to detail carries this show beautifully.The only complaints while watching were the filler scenes; making the show feel as though it's dragging at some points. Some complained about the acting of the VIPs, but I think that was intentionally done by the creators.",9
East Asia,"The plot is super interesting! It offers you almost identical storyline to the one of Alice in borderland, but it's even better. The characters are all round, none of them are flat. The gore is great and it does leave you on the brink of being creeped out by the events it creates. Love every bit of it. Moreover, the plot twist at the end is really well done, if you keep your eyes peeled at every little detail, you can figure it out yourself, but it's not really all that simple.Really recommend it to everyone. Very interesting and can't wait for season 2.",10
East Asia,Nothing crazy the ending was pretty alright. I enjoyed it but people are going way too crazy over it. Most characters I just didn't really connect with and a lot of things were very predictable.,7
East Asia,"Enjoyed a lot of it but..
It was predictable for the most part which is fine in most cases but I think a better plot twist at the end could've improved it. Also the Vip thing was weird and disappointing, the acting on them was... Pretty self explanatory.... Most characters were written quite well which I liked.",7
East Asia,This is honestly the best series i have ever watched i finished it in one night and now i cant stop thinking about it everything about it is perfect the storyline the events are not exepcted a lot of plot twists i have every single emotion watching this stress anxiety anger happy and i mean it i will never regret watching it good job.,10
East Asia,Turned off on the preview - the VIPs were that bad.,9
East Asia,I'm not really into films with dubbing but this was done well so you don't even notice. Probably up there with my favourite every series.,9
East Asia,It's super dark and intriguing and shows the lengths different humans will go out of greed. Messed with me a lot though sheesh.,10
East Asia,I just created an account to rate this. Perfect korean thriller series! We need more of these.,10
East Asia,"I'm not into Korean movies, but I actually binge watched this one. No way to stop until the end. Every episode is a crescendo, until the end.",9
East Asia,"The Escher sets and the island hideaway that could have come from the Pinewood 007 stage are memorable but the programme is sunk by ithe moral vacuum at its core.SPOILERS ABOUND BELOW
Hundreds are despatched as so much deadwood so that we can have meaningful encounters with those granted speaking parts and they in turn dutifully expire so that the supposedly morally conflicted main character can feel a bit upset and buy off his complicity in the slaughter by chucking shedloads of his winnings at the sole dependent of one of the 400+ victims. Yes, he does look morose and affects appropriate hair growth to the point where he really must be saddened by the whole unpleasantness and even goes as far as having a salon dye his hair red (and do a terrible job at the rear - if you take away anything from this drama it is to ensure you get them to use a mirror to show you the back if you visit a barber in Korea).The contortions of probability required to support the reveal of the old man as the kingpin of the enterprise point to a rethinking of the physical world more radical than that proposed by Einstein and the logistics and financing of the operation are underpinned by no more than the fact that someone conceived of them in an idle moment and never troubled themselves to give it a second thought.The second series is a slam dunk but I'll follow the example of the few who chose not to return to the game - life outside may not always be a bed of roses but returning to the unpleasant stench of this narrative is a far worse proposition.",3
East Asia,"If you liked any Black Mirror episode, imagine this series is 10 times better. Perversion, simplicity, emotion, action and drama, all in 1 package. A must watch.",10
East Asia,"If you've already watched Alice in Wonderland and As Gods will, you're gonna be disappointed.The first 4 episodes were good, the plot was promising.And then came the Second half, which felt rushed and the writers out of ideas....
The plot with the VIP was already seen many times and it felt awkward and ridiculous. And the rest was over dramatic and the ""plot twists""/reveals so typical...
I felt like I've wasted my time with this series....",4
East Asia,"The title of the movie is a little strange, but it is not surprising cuz most Korean movies have weird titles. However, it is quite entertaining, immersive, and highly addictive. Is season 2 going to be an octopus game?",9
East Asia,"Very cool
Way way better than the Hunger Games.... Its in the same twisted vein as the recent Japanese TV series Alice in BorderlandA must watch.",10
East Asia,"No dull moments, a show where the interactions and scenes really matter. If you watch carefully and pay attention the the players numbers there is a ton of foreshadowing.The acting is great, and Gi-hun's character growth is astounding. The games range from brutal, to jarring, to gut wrenching, to jaw dropping. Fairly gruesome.Terrific ending, but I can't imagine season 2 living up to this. Really great show can't recommend enough.",10
East Asia,"I was hooked into the series right from the start. It has a good plot and getting to know the main character. From there it is a blast. Some people may find it disturbing, but it is a part if the show. You will have to watch it. Only down side is the last episode.",8
East Asia,"The plot is exciting.. keeps the viewers on the edge of their seat.. but the ending is so rushed and not so great.. the final game chosen, the squid game is not so exciting especially for only 2 players .. then to make it worse it turned into a boring cliched knife fighting scene.. they should have chosen a more exciting game for a great climax..in the earlier part it's kinda weird that sang woo showed his caring side to Gi Hun in the first game but then suddenly in the second game he showed his selfishness just after he agreed to team up with him.. I get it sang woo is being competitive to win the money but it does not seem he looks at Gi hun as a threat and there are still many other opponents at that time..so why showed Sang woo's good side just to expose his selfishness so soon?And in the end I get it when sang woo suddenly has his conscience and finally let Gi Hun wins, because he knows Gi Hun is a nice guy that will make sure his mother will get somethingbut it is kinda boring that Gi Hun is being too nice and too kindhearted and wants to end everything at the edge of winning just to let that selfish sang woo lives...not after what sang woo did to everyone.. It will be more satisfying if Gi Hun just wins the game fair and square and just let sang woo be killed by that masked staffand at the end it is so irrational to use the sad emotional music while the mastermind is explaining why he did all that.. so are we suppose to feel sorry for him and forget how evil he truly is?And how does Gi Hun save himself from all the loan sharks for one whole year? He didnt use his money so there is no way he settled his debt with them..And I dont like it that Gi Hun left his plane in the end I mean for what? Yes he has won the game once but there is no way he can get his revenge he is no match for them..dont tell me after he is being depressed for one whole year than suddenly he will be heroic and all smart in the second season? (If there is any) Unless Jun Ho, the policeman is actually not dead maybe they can team up with Gi Hun's money and all the information that Jun Ho got, they might get somewhereand if it is really the end of Jun Ho, it is so bad to write him off just like that, not after he took so many risks to gather all the proves but to no use..The acting of most characters, the cinematography and the idea are nice, only I just wish it has a better ending.",5
East Asia,"This show is really good. A 'BIT' like a Korean 'Hunger Games'. The story is great and the struggles that dominate the plot create a lot of great tension. It reeled me in right from the start. Give it an episode and you'll be hooked.The things that hurt it:EXTREMELY poor dubbing. A few of the character's voices are so comically bad that it's pretty cringey at times.One actress is absolutely terrible and should've been either played by someone else, or the part should've been written out. So bad.The VIPs are pretty ridiculous.Other than that, I look forward to another season. Not sure what they can do with it after such a great start.",7
East Asia,"I get the premise.. I get the idea.. I just don't get the acting. You have characters acting super goofy at times and then super serious at other times.. like, not on a real world scale but a comical scale.. it's like watching Jim Carrey switch from Ace Ventura to Keanu Reeves' John Wick (in the beginning of the first one).. how are you gonna have a goofy nerd making absurd faces and dancing around like and idiot some badass later on? It makes no sense.. certainly have never witnessed this in any human behavior I've ever seen. It's like they wrote the part for 4 very different people and then combined it into one.. I give it points for originality but I hated the characters. They all could have died and it would have probably turned out better.",6
East Asia,"Squid game offers everything you can ask for in a guilty pleasure gore filled thriller. They also take their time to really flush out the characters even with such a diverse cast, highlighting all aspects of humanity that would expect to see in a game of life and death.With a 9 episode run for this 1st season it's a great weekend binge show.",8
East Asia,"This show is a great Korean drama adventure that will make the audience at their edge all the time, well written and great acting.Hands up for Netflix & Korea for deliver this show and looking forward for more cooperation to come in the near future.Unpopular opinion: This V. I. P characters acting is dumb and the way they talk is annoying but I think a human enjoy watching other people suffering has to be dumb and have a brain damage somehow!!",9
East Asia,"The concept of the show is very unique and it was really interesting. But the show was really slow paced. So, if you don't have the patience you might even quit. Acting was good except the few VIPs whose acting were horrible. The show makes you emotional towards various characters.",8
East Asia,"So good I can't even describe it , story acting everything is soooooo goooood !",10
East Asia,Quite the unique show. I was hooked from the first episode. Haven't binged something in a long time but could not stop this one. Totally out of the box creatively. Loved it. Give it a watch.,10
East Asia,"Way better than Hunger Games. Great story, actors, and moral choices and animal instincts of humans.",10
East Asia,Entertaining and demonstrating human nature via this drama. My conclusion is not to be poor otherwise become a chess from rich.,7
East Asia,"I don't know what to feel about this movie series. The main protagonist questioning the morality of others, where he obviously lacked it when he cheated against the old man (pre-character reveal). And still he continues to question the morality of the game even when it just started, it is already clear that you have to surrender your morality in order to survive.I also have to fast-forward some drama moments because they are very cliché to be honest.",3
East Asia,Episode 6 really got me hard.Only thing is the subtitles need to be improved.Never had this many tears. Amazing series!,9
East Asia,"This show was like a mixtape of other (and better) shows. You can virtually see the Netflix algorithm in action: ""The capitalism parable in Parasite won an Oscar, so let's go with that. And people responded really well to the colorful uniforms and weird masks in Casa de Papel, so let's give people a chance to dress up as our characters on Halloween which will give the show free PR. Oh, and Battle Royale was really successful and influential, so let's pretty much steal that whole concept right down to the classical music and cheery female speaker!""The VIPs get a lot of flak for their acting in many reviews on IMDb, and rightly so. But let's be honest, the Korean actors are no better. This show is filled to the brim with bad Asian style overacting, something which is far too common in Korean and Japanese shows. The bad guy with the face tattoo is right out of some school play, and the guy in the lead is pulling faces like a madman. I have no idea who they are but I wouldn't be surprised if they originally are comedians. The best actor in the whole show is the main character's daughter and she's only in it for a couple of minutes.As per usual for a Netflix production the story is stretched very thin in order to make it nine hours (!) long.",4
East Asia,My first K Series ever and I was not disappointed. The story and acting were both amazing.,10
East Asia,"Amazing acting by the main actors and side characters. VIPs were the only annoying part of the movie but they did their part. Music was a bit annoying at times but it gave a lot of it tension that was really needed in all of the ""games"". The ending is incredible and I don't think there should be a season 2. I would love to see more tho. I feel like they didn't really think the show itself is going to get really popular so they ended it right there.9/10 only thing that was bad were the VIPs. Would love to see more with the VIP plot etc.",7
East Asia,"What an amazing series taking you on a roller coaster of emotions, we couldn't stop watching it. I agree with the other viewers that the VIP acting was rubbish but equally I think they are meant to represent caricatures of the most vile people who enjoy killing for sport. Wow the acting though from the Korean cast is first rate and the story line has a deeper message for all of us. Episode 6 had me wrecked!",10
East Asia,Damn what I just watched. And.episode 6 just squeezed all the tears out from me.,10
East Asia,"It's disturbing but all the more entertaining for it. I rarely watch series with a plot, let alone that fast (took me less than 4 days, which is super unusual for me). Read some reviews saying there was no character development but I will have to disagree. All major character change from ep 1 to their last respective scene. Some scenes were very emotional as well, ep 6 had me sobbing. The acting by the VIP's was a bit off-putting but ultimately didn't bother me as much. I loved the games too, being of Korean descent. Only the 5th game was somewhat out of order and dragged a bit. The additional storylines around the games made it even more real, somehow. There are some open ends which have me looking forward to the 2nd season.",10
East Asia,"The survival game trope isn't usually my thing, but this one was actually done really well. The characters are complex with backstory so it's not just all about the games.I agree with everyone else about the VIPs. Prepare yourself for them and try to pretend they didn't happen. I can't wait for the day kdramas stop sticking random English speakers into their shows. They're always the worst actors and no matter how good the show and the Korean actors are, the English speakers always instantly make the scene cheesy and look and act like a fish out of water.To be fair I have spoken to a Korean friend who told me that due to the language barrier this awkward delivery isn't picked up on in Korea. But just a warning, the English speaking scenes in this show were the most cringy I've seen in any kdrama, both acting wise and writing too for some reason. The rest of the show was great.Otherwise, highly recommended. I loved the last episode, and it seems they left room for a possible season 2.",8
East Asia,"We make poor choices in life. That's the truth. But we must learn from them.This show is about a man, Gi Hun, who isn't really down on his luck but more so just plain stupid. That's the first episode. Instead of buying a present for his daughter he chose to gamble away the money and if that couldn't get worse he doubles down.This show is like that, endless repetitive doubling down. Which makes it... nonsense. Completely.I'll explain why. From the get go, the audience (in this case, me) find it difficult if not impossible to root for Gi Hun because he actively and knowingly create situations where he will lose. He's gambling-addict I get that. But to take money from loansharks, then gamble that away and proceed to waive his physical rights (is that even legal) is whole another level of stupid. Fast forward little bit he meets a mysterious person working for the squid game in recruiting players, the man invites him to play a game where they will bet serious money (that Gi Hun does not have) and we find ourselves yet in another situation, Gi Hun gets completely slapped left and right because he cannot pay yet he continues to gamble and winning once, he is completely satiafied.Now we find ourselves in the squid game where players have a chance to win billions. But after the first game with hundreds of players die, they vote to end the game so no one gets anything and get to go home.This is where the internal logic of this show falls apart. Supposedly everyone is in it for the money and after going back to play again they are completely ready to die. Only they are not ready to die, they think that they have a better chance here than they do in real world.It gets worse, they are made to believe that the games are fair but they are not. As some of the players brought contraband, one player is the mastermind behind, and one player knows the next game.Only one person in that group gets punished, rest did not face any consequence.Fairness is thrown out the window.Rules are arbitrary (front man/vip shows his face but the rest cannot?)Sacrifices are made meaningless because it's either the person who sacrificed is alive, or the person who gets saved dies.One ordinary cop can get through security but the police has not caught a whiff of squid game?In the end this is just another death game show with poor worldbuilding. Poor choices.",6
East Asia,Honestly I'm good reviewer.. this series is great go and watch.,10
East Asia,"I think if I spoke Korean and could watch this without it being dubbed, I would probably love it and give it at least 9 starts. But the dubbing is bad and the dialogue is amateurish. I'm guessing they have to make the English words fit the time frame of the actor's mouths moving and maybe because of that it is not a direct translation and that is why it is often so bad. But beyond that, the voice actors doing the dubbing are often pretty flat in their delivery. So while this is an intriguing watch, it is marred by the voice actors doing the dubbing (and the writers who I think could have done better with the dialogue).",6
East Asia,"I remember watching Korean films back in the day and they had .. something. These days it seems they copy American style with a bit of a twist, but still disappointing.In episode 4, they make a huge plot mistake which makes no sense (food, without spoiling too much).This show is like news media... using something to shock you, to get you to watch, but no quality or depth to it.",1
East Asia,It used to make me cringe. But I'm not gonna watch this in the original language. English is already my second language. Hating substitles was the reason i learnt English before school to begin with.,5
East Asia,"A very slow series, there are many much better Korean series/ films if you want to watch foreign films. Just don't bother with this one - the acting is poor, the dubbing is awful, and the ending is an absolute mess!",4
East Asia,"Why giving rich people stupid ideas? Acting is so good, actors are very honest and Koreans are so beautiful, but the VIPs... it is so bad. Love for Wi Ha Jun.",7
East Asia,"I don't usually review, but when I do, It is really really good.",10
East Asia,"I really liked the show, the beginning for me PERSONALLY was just a bit boring but I clung on and was attached to the show by the end of it. If you have watched the show, you'll know about THAT episode and.. I was speechless and broken by the end of it and it was great, the actors were amazing at portraying all the emotions.The ""VIP's"" voice acting / acting were.. horrid HAHA it was so bad, I just couldn't help laughing. The ending was rough and messy and I wasn't a big fan of it especially how they forced hinted the second season :/Overall, I really recommend it, the show is great, the actors are awesome and you really feel the emotions and the vibes they emitted. It truly was a rollercoaster and I recommend this ride. Each episode leaves you wanting to watch the next.",8
East Asia,"Let me keep it straight.Squid Game has a better cinematography (see the color contrast!!!) but Alice in the Borderland is way darker (n thus better, personally) as a thriller and horror series. I dunno why but Japanese directors are more capable of creating stunning gore effects and death/necro scenes. Which is to say, If u can't stand the horror and jump-scare of Alice in the Borderland, then Squid Game is the one more u. It is visually mild in every aspects, plus a warmer story to make u feel easier.Back to Squid Game, I think it's not something original and groundbreaking. As a survival horror series it is too warm, too humane. The baddies are not that bad (at all!!). Finally, why there is always a super clean-n-tidy, pale skin, ""handsome"", smart, literate, elite entrepreneur young prince???? Where is the alpha-male?????!!!!!!",6
East Asia,"I heard so much hype for this so I was excited to watch. I did enjoy the first episodes a lot and was really positively surprised with diverse characters like Ali and Sae Byeok. I wish we got more depth to her and surely she would have had very interesting background/flashbacks. I wish there had been more winners honestly, cos i thought multiple winners were possible. The whole VIP rich guys pay to watch people die seemed quite predictable too. I never really found Gi-hun that relatable and wasnt much character growth. I really think Sae Byeok shouldnt have died - but survived and won the game for her brother and family. It was nice touch Gi-hun did keep his promise and gave her brother better life, but still. The end of him going back to the game is promising for S2, but cliche.",6
East Asia,Im still thinking about it. Its freaking genius!!!,10
East Asia,When I saw the preview it didn't look that interesting but when I was on TikTok there was a scene they were playing a game it was so crazy and I'm like wow I need to watch it so I'm already on episode 5. If you want to watch something would blow your mind this is it.,10
East Asia,"This series is exceptional. It poses a narrative which delves into the human psyche. Themes of duality, choice, power and control are played out within the game. The series is analysing socio-political, gender and class binaries within stunning scenography, beautiful symbology and a compelling story line.I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Battle Royale, or Asian Tartan Extreme films.",10
East Asia,"Squid game was really good, beyond my expactations. However, VIPs part and final was so cheesy! You shound watch behind the scenes video and see that most places, they were real!",8
East Asia,Korea is turning to one best movie makers . What a fascinating serie.,8
East Asia,"One of the well-made, and original shows. The highlights: its writing, creative direction, Large and beautiful set design, character developments, and an uncovering of the truth of Humanity. Though it is not for faint-hearted people as it is brutal and disturbing in many ways still A masterpiece that every movie premyy should watch. Highly Recommended! ?",10
East Asia,This show is violent and there is a lot of death in it.But it is compelling and well shot.Don't speak Korean so I cannot comment on the translations or the voice acting of dub people.,8
East Asia,Best show! The story is excruciating and the best one so far on my suspense k drama list. A must watch drama.,10
East Asia,"Predictable and melodramatic to a fault. The treatment of the female characters was botched, the whole production felt unbelievably forced... And don't even get me started on the VIPs.",2
East Asia,"The show is essentially a show that begins with a realistic interpretation of the psychological aspect of a ""battle royale"" life or death game where people are desperate and motivated by the insurmountable debt they have accumulated. It quickly throws this idea away half way through the show where the money doesn't matter, life is more important than money, and winning a life or death game with a ""good heart"" will show the true winner. This is the Asian concept that I put in my title that I thought was too melancholy for my taste and ruined the realism of peoples actual reaction to this type of turmoil.The first game in the first episode is a game of red light; green light, where if you are eliminated you are shot. Over 200 people die and they barely win a vote to get off the island because they did not expect the games to be this inhumane. This is a respectable understanding and it made sense for the story. But many of the people who voted to leave, found out that their debt back home was ruining their lives more than they remembered and choose to reenter into the games.This is where the show starts to get too stereotypical for me. The games don't matter because plot armor is already established and they instead treat the games like they are ""forced"" to be there and must win by being the most compassionate and caring of all the players. This makes no sense and is contradicting when they chose to be there not once but twice.All instances of life and death situation is thrown out the window and many pretend that everyone is of good nature and, ""we can win this with everyone still alive"". Then they turn one character into a psychopath because he did what he had to do while actually playing the games and then ACTUALLY turn him into a psychopath purely to make a ""final boss"" enemy in the show.I won't spoil everything in the show if you choose to watch it but they also have a lot of "" saw that coming"" and ""give me a break"" plot twists in the show that I thought were reminiscent of the Asian cinema stereotype and it kind of ruined the show for me. But the show deserved at least a 5 or 6 at the least. But knowing Netflix, they will make a second season off of this because of its popularity when its not needed and ruin the entire story line even further.",5
East Asia,"This is my first time writing a review on Imdb and i am only doing this because of this series.I have to say that it's one of the best series Netflix has brought to us so far. If i ever had the ability to forget everything and rewatch it, i would have done it.A really exciting and dramatic series at the same time. It almost made me cry at some point.",10
East Asia,I would never thought that a show could blow my mind that much its really deep and also very dark i recommend it for everyone with a strong mind. One of the best shows ever.,10
East Asia,"It is the first Korean TV series I watched. I found it very interesting, with fast action. It also gives you food for thought. Unlike series of similar cases, it has the main difference that the players are there voluntarily. This creates different dynamics and plot. Watching the first 6 episodes I was excited. From the 7th episode until the end, there was no surprise and everything was predictable.The explanation of why all this happened,was just what was expected. The story with the policeman and his brother, did not finally seem to have special meaning. The ""plot twist"" with the old man, was not a plot twist at all, if you have watched ""Saw' 1 & 2 and many of the thrillers that followed it. Perfect up to a point, but without a climax. This could have been a 10 but..",7
East Asia,"I really wish at the end, the frontman was just Mr Beast. Seems like something he would do just to mix it up a bit.All seriousness aside, this is a real thrill ride with some absolutely brutal moments and really shows the lengths people go to stay alive. Greed, guilt, remorse, relief and anger are just a handful of the emotions shown by the cast.Very thought provoking and would highly recommend to anyone.",9
East Asia,Super good cant believe this was based on a true story. We have to stop them.,10
East Asia,"Awesome.VIPs tho, so dumb. Horrible voices, line delivery, and acting. Would have been better if they said nothing at all. It was like they were all doing bugs bunny impersonations. Horrible.",8
East Asia,"*light spoilers of plot details*Squid Game is a story about a large group of deeply indebted Korean citizens who willingly take part in a deadly game in the hopes of taking away a massive cash prize at the expense of the other participants' lives.Now, that's all well and good. Who doesn't love a good show of violence and human selfishness? There are many great character moments in this series, moments of shameless manipulation, hopefuly naïvety, and self deception. However, this story paints the lives of the participants in a way that is often boring, uninteresting, and downright unbelievable. Honestly, none of the characters act like real people, and there are several GLARING plot holes and nonsensical plot points to boot; for example, 456 people go missing at the exact same time, staying missing for three days, 255 of them NEVER RETURNED, and absolutely nobody, anywhere, seems to notice this insane phenomenon that would've made international headlines in the real world. I mentioned this to a friend, and he pointed out a detail that I missed: these games have been going on FOR YEARS. How have several mass kidnappings, involving hundreds of people disappearing in a single day, remain completely unnoticed by anybody? Wouldn't the police be taking missing person reports more seriously by now? How... that's it, just how. How? How. Any of this, all of this, just how.But, don't worry, because our main character, the very sane man that he is, goes to the police! Good boy, maybe we can do something about this mass murder! However, none of the officers take him seriously. So, what's his next move? Go to a different police station? Call a news outlet? Nope. Our hero gave up right then and there. Didn't even write a blog about the horror show he was subject to, he just fully gave up because the police were mean to him. He saw more than 200 people shot to death in a goofy red light green light death game, almost died himself, and this is the best he can do to for all those dead people. I suppose we have to assume that nobody else went to the police, and if they did, they were also laughed into complete silence. All I can say is... how? How. The only police officer who did half of his job was a detective who overheard our main character, and only because his brother is one of the people who went missing, decides to investigate it OFF THE BOOKS, conveniently informing noone of his investigation or wherabouts. First of all, the fact that he's only investigating this because his brother is missing is mind blowingly selfish. Second of all, WHY DIDN'T HE WRITE ANY OF THIS DOWN? Is this guy even a real cop, or is he just role playing? HOW IS ANY OF THIS HAPPENING THE WAY IT'S HAPPENING? HOW DID NOBODY NOTICE THAT 456 PEOPLE WERE MISSING FOR 3 DAYS, AND 255 OF THEM NEVER RETURNED? Honestly, once the detective character goes all Solid Snake and hops on the bad guy boat, not making any calls to his unit, with nothing but a pistol and a cell phone, you have to wonder ""How bad are things in South Korea right now?"" It must be damn near post apocalyptic over there for this groundbreaking case to be in the hands of a madman who probably isn't actual law enforcement.Speaking of the plot, I couldn't write about this show without discussing the insane premise that it relies upon: all of our main characters decided to take part in a game that would kill all but one of them. All participants are made aware of this fact, and surely realize the simple reality that they and everyone they met during the first game have virtually no chance of survival, yet nobody acts as if this is the case. Only 3% of the people who were unknowingly thrust into a lethal game and witnessed 255 people killed before their very eyes decided that their lives weren't bad enough to warrant throwing them away in a game that only one person could survive. Not even gonna ask how on that one, I'm just gonna call bulls**t. Everyone with a family and loved ones, everyone who voted to end the games after the first session of bloody horror, all of them determined that they, in fact, had no reason to live OR were going to die anyway, and every last one of them decided that the only chance they had at a normal life was to give the murder games another shot. Who cares about the odds, amiright? Furthermore, our beloved main characters, all stupid enough to enter this lethal lottery, continue to develop friendships between and during each murder game, forever in denial of the fact that they will die. I don't understand how any of these people, excluding the actual psychopaths, can rationalize reentering the game. Sure, maybe they didn't even consider the odds, maybe all of these degenerate gamblers are so stupid and so arrogant that they all believe they will be the sole victor. Why not. However, that hardly explains why a married couple entered the games, knowing for a fact that AT LEAST one of them would die, and the husband had the imbecilic audacity to get upset when his wife died. What did you think was going to happen? I knew what was going to happen, and we both have the same information, so why didn't you know what was going to happen? I found myself frequently asking my television this question during my initial viewing of this series.There are too many impossibly irrational character choices in this show to list, and far too many for a critical viewer to ignore. Without reasonable people or a remotely well thought-out story, it's damn near impossible to suspend my disbelief. I watched it anyway, just to see how much further down the plot hole-hole it could go, and thought ut technically could have been worse, the story would have had to change my life to counteract the inexcusable implausibility. By the way, the last episode is aost unwatchably dull and features two very different yet equally flacid plot twists. Also, the first two games are the only decent ones, and they all kinda suck after that.Really quick, before I wrap this up, let's do a plot hole/stupid character choices lightning round: having the elderly founder participate in the games, including several physically demanding ones like tug of war, is an impossibly stupid gamble; metal detectors exist, the squid games facility might consider trying them; the rules of every game arbitrarily change in favor of the plot; tempered glass refracts light differently than normal glass, such that just about anybody could see the difference; Gi-hun's gambling debt put him is such a dangerous situation with loan sharks, yet he was able to survive for years without touching his money. I'm getting tired at this point, so I'll just leave it at that.If you don't give a good god damn about attention to detail, and you like a mediocre, violent spectacle that comes to a grinding hault for frequent and irritating character drama, this might just be the series for you. Also, the production design was actually quite fascinating, so if that's something that interests you, watch an episode or two.",6
East Asia,"The show is a bit overhyped but it has its reasons. It was good for a long while until the very end.I like the show from start til episode 8.The last episode felt like it ruined the good things in the show. I wouldn't discount the good story but I still cant get over what happened in the end. Is it just to have a second season? I wish it could have been done differently though. I would much rather have a good happy ending where he just lives normally with his daughter and adopt Sae-Byeok's brother not just leave money for an old woman to take care of.The show isncalled squid game but the final game didnt really justify squid game properly as they both end up fighting for survival. I mean at least make the series reasonable with its title. We spend so much minutes on ther challenges and we could barely get 30 minutes on squid game.He could have straightened his life instead of going after the squid game organizers.Also what happened to the cop? There was no definitive ending for him. Was he really dead? Was was there no closure for him and his brother?But I wouldnt discount the good plot. Overall I like the story. It is really good and the characters really showed passion in their work. There were some hit and miss especially when the vips came to the scene, they have the worse acting.Overall, This is still a great series just really cant get over the final episode.",6
East Asia,"This is a must-watch series . It's very unique and it had me at the edge of my bed right throughout the season. The ending was not expected, but it was very interesting and I can't wait for season 2.",10
East Asia,"Great series, but I agree with most other reviews. The VIPS were ridiculous.",8
East Asia,"I have never seen a ""last man standing gets the money"" movie/series that pulled me in as much as this did. I was at the edge of my seat the entire time. (Not just because I had to read the subtitles) the raw emotion and human spirit that was shown throughout, and especially at the very end by the main character, was emotionally moving, to say the least. The mental and emotional damage shown by the players towards throughout felt so genuine. You found yourself cheering for the characters, only to be hit by the gravity of what is to happen after. They say money doesn't buy happiness, I disagree to an extent. Money would solve all of my depression right now. I have a happy marriage with a lovely wife, a beautiful son, and a decent house. However, we are so in debt due to NICU bills and other debts, and are about to lose our home. I have been thrown so low to the point of some of these characters, and I could relate to them. Would I be a part of Squid Game? Definitely not. I have too much to lose. Beautiful, yet sobering series.",10
East Asia,I loved this show for many reasons. The story was great I loved the concept and characters. The violence and gore was great too. The downfall is the bad acting at times it's kinda laughable bad. Overall a great surprise and I want more seasons even if it's with a new cast. I want more !!!,7
East Asia,Gi-Hun is played by Lee Jung-Jae not my Greg Chun.Kindly edit the cast.,9
East Asia,I really enjoyed this show and can't wait for a second season.I really liked the characters and became invested in them.A few things I didn't like was I wished they focused more on the games. A lot of the episodes focused on the characters.I also wish the main character put his daughter first. That was a bit annoying to see because I like his character.I still don't understand the point of the games and offering the money. I wish it had been explained better. Seemed like they tried to and I still don't get it.But other than those things it was enjoyable and very unique. I was on the edge of my seat so many times and I had to remind myself it's only tv.There are a few twists in it too if you like twists like I do.Highly recommend it.,8
East Asia,I haven't enjoyed a first season like this since Westworld and can't recommend this enough. Was a little bit jarring at first but really merged a lot of genres that had never been done before and knocked it out of the ballpark. A+,10
East Asia,"""Squid Game"" is definitely a slow burn in its first 2 episodes (but they do give you a taste of what's to come). As for the rest of the season, you probably won't be able to stop watching thanks to its story, characters, thrills, twists, games and, of course, gore.",10
East Asia,"Sure, it's a complete rip-off of a Japanese classic movie but it's still one of the most imaginative and visually stunning shows this year.Love it.Watch it!",10
East Asia,"Great acting, heart and soul, lots of action and hard decision making. A tad slow at first, but after ep 2, I couldn't look away. At times I wanted to but I just couldn't. Definitely recommend.",10
East Asia,"I watched this show in the original language of Korean with English subtitles.I'm writing this review after watching the first seven shows, because it's very interesting. One big thing I like in shows is morality. Everyone has morals, and they differ in each individual. I enjoy Star Trek because of the focus on morals. Same thing with The Orville. This show is no exception.One important thing regarding morality is that every single character is there by their own free will and choice. This is important, even though the creators of the games didn't give any details as to what the games would be.Spoilers: The first game involved a deadly game of Red Light, Green Light. Unlike the original game, players caught moving on a red light were shot. The creators used technology to detect movement. Upon realizing the deadly aspect, most players panicked and tried to leave but ended up shot due to being caught moving.What got the players to come was potential prize money. Each eliminated player added money to the pot.After the first game, some players remaining didn't want to continue, even after seeing the amount of prize money they were playing for. Players signed a contract involving three clauses, one of which was the games would stop if the majority wanted to stop. Therefore, the game's creators put it to a vote. They barely reached a majority, the games ended, and they dropped off the remaining players in different locations.However, the games would continue if the majority of the players returned. The game's creators enticed players to return and, eventually, all but about 10 to 20 people came back.I don't want to get too detailed regarding the plot, but the point of this review is the morals. My thinking changed during the course of the show.While watching the first game, I'm thinking that I would be playing very carefully after watching the first person getting shot, so I wouldn't die. I'm hoping I wouldn't get too scared and freeze completely.For the second game, I don't know if I would have passed. I might be too scared to try, or I would be too careful and run out of time. Each game had a time limit, and they shot any remaining players that didn't complete it.For the third game and even during the riot, I didn't think about what I would do in their situation. I probably would have tried to find some place to hide to avoid others from attacking.For game four, this opens so many possibilities. Would I sacrifice myself for the other to move on, or would I sincerely try to beat the other? What game would I choose? Of course, it would depend on who my partner was. Also, would I to trick the other, so I would survive and move on? I probably wouldn't be able to live with that guilt for the rest of my life.One character went against his wife and couldn't get over the fact that he won. He wanted to end the games and tried to get players to join him. One character pointed out that ending the game would make his wife's sacrifice pointless. I was thinking along those lines, too.For game five, the first thing I would do is try to tell the difference between the two glass panes. One of the later players ended up doing that. The host turned out the lights to remove the advantage.Many players during game five got scared and hesitated regarding deciding which glass pane to choose. It was a 50/50 shot, and the player would fall to their death if wrong. There was a time limit involved. When one player sat on one of the glass panes and started praying, I got the feeling that the player behind should push him.In summary, this show got my attention and my interest. I was even cheering for some of the characters, and I disliked a couple. The morality aspect is the most interesting part of the game, and the show even surprised me on more than one occasion. The show isn't for everyone due to gore, profanity, some suggestive dialogue, one somewhat detailed sex scene, another scene where a guy tries to get another guy to go down on him, and one scene where naked women appear as furniture.",8
East Asia,It's simply one of the best thriller series I've ever seen. I'm starting to dig in the Korean TV series to find sth similar.,9
East Asia,"I really loved the show, it was absolutely nerve wrecking and kept me at the edge of my seat most of the time. Plot wise and cast wise its all good. I didn't really like the ending, i felt it was rushed a bit. As for the VIPs i really hated how they were portrayed. They're supposed to be the main reason for running the game but they're a bunch of old ridiculous perverts. This really annoyed me. Apart from this, i enjoyed it alot, waiting for season 2.",8
East Asia,"Take Battle Royale, Alice in Borderland, and Ultimate Survivor Kaiji - put them in a blender with all the best parts of each - BOOM you get Squid Game. Incredible plot, great acting (yea the English VIPs were awful, but not enough to the people who are complaining about them in reviews), and the intensity...wonderful series.",10
East Asia,"Squid Game is another bullet in the chamber against streaming television.What other, also terrible films (""would you rather"" immediately comes to mind) have managed to do in 2 hours, Squid Game takes 9 to draw the same conclusion: people suck when money is involved.Hundreds of people down on their luck agree to take part in a series of games with an unannounced prize fee. After a few hundred are shot down in a game of ""red light, green light"" they get told every life is worth quite a lot of cash. Gi-Hun, Sang,Wool and Sa-Beok are our eyes as they go through the tortures and trials of the whims of the rich, hounded by the poor.Nothing here is new. The twists have all been done, the characters are all so broadly drawn that their motivations are unreasonable except in service of a story. The conclusions, as to why they're playing children's games, and why it's all happening, might offer some comfort, but it's all nonsensical. Scenes that could have given understanding to why one manipulative shrew eventually sacrifices herself and another for the good of the survivors would have been favourable to repeat scenes of endless people in tracksuits walking up and down stairs. Giving us a true villain in the game with a counter POV for the final games would have set up a much better war of ideologies in an uncaring society than two sides of the same coin and an emotional bond that had been severed several episodes previously. Having an omniscient operator accuse a player of cheating and ruining the ""equality"" of the game is laughable, when you consider the same faceless man does everything in his power to handicap adept players, and ensure as many people as possible die in unfair circumstances as possible.The Korean actors are all swell, but it's so difficult to comprehend how they chose the foreigners who appear in the final few episodes. They sound like they're badly dubbed, and even though they wear masks, their performances are stiff as the gold encrusted animals they wear.Skip over this. Netflix needs to stop financing every poorly thought out idea they land on, and begin considering quality over content.",2
East Asia,"Standard down on their luck beginning of characters, then the storyline quickly goes into overdrive with many social mores broken.I guessed the ending but the reason I don't give this 10/10 is the last episode is somewhat muddled. The angst and actions of the main character is weakly explained.",9
East Asia,"I rarely write reviews but this show is bingeworthy, it gots me laughing, crying at the same times and the color of the movie, those actors' acting skills were heart-touching, spectacular I must say. I guess I was a bit confused due to the last episode but to dig deep down inside the main character, he has a really warm heart from the moment that he fed a cat to the moment that he stop the game for his friend, so I guess it has never been easy for him to use that money immidiately. And after seeing the death of 455 players, it is understandable why he didn't choose to break his daughter's new family in LA (which can be considered as paradise) but come back to Hell Joseon as a new human-being (when ppl change their hair color, it means that they want to be a new them) to maybe get revenge for his friend or change the whole system of the game ^^? Can't wait to know what will happen next so please release season 2 the sooner the better!!!!",10
East Asia,There are a bunch of much older Japanese dramas & films of this genre (survival games) that are far superior but less popular. Talk about marketing and promotion...,4
East Asia,I loved most of the series but I think the end of this first season made no sense. Why the red hair color? He wanted the money to be a good father but when he won it feels like he completely forgot about his daughter... I really disliked the way the handle the end.,6
East Asia,"The acting in Squid Game is phenomenal. I've seen so many negative reviews based on the acting of the VIPS - in which you BARELY even see. It's the typical rich people acting - is it worth an Oscar... no, but the acting from the Korean cast is worthy of awards no doubt.Squid Game is a fun, fast paced ride I would take again. Highly recommend!",10
East Asia,If you are looking for a show with amazing performers (except the vip) then you need to watch squid game. Episode 6 is heart breaking. A tv show has yet to make me cry yet this one did. If I could give another standing ovation then I would.,10
East Asia,"Koreans now to the Emmy awards. Great, surprising.But ending is disappointing. Maybe It's because of there's another season ..",9
East Asia,"If you like Battle Royale, The Prisoner, Hunger Games and a good drama - this is for you.Set in South Korea in the present day, this series is a stark look at what people will do when society has failed them - richly character driven and with a wonderfully original take on the sinister, this is a Netflix series that has depth, drama, entertainment and shock-value.It's a not afraid to be a slow burner at times, but the mystery and slight surrealist nature of 'The Game' drives your attention throughout.It's worth watching and taking time over. Really recommended.",9
East Asia,"I loved it. Right up to the vips, which were pathetic, however didn't ruin the show too much.Well worth the binge on a Saturday night.",10
East Asia,"We've seen every element of this before. My wife and I sat here predicting how every single scene would play out. The acting, while carried by a few good performances, was uninspiring and the lack of character development made it hard to care for the fates of anyone in the show. More enjoyment came from retranslating the poor subtitles than actually following the story.",3
East Asia,"A Korean series that shows a group of people who are put in a deadly game for money until one wins and manages to survive. We saw the story before but it has moments that are captivating, the message of social criticism is interesting. Obviously it's not perfect there are script conveniences, moments when the story is unnecessarily slowed down. It's worth it anyway.",6
East Asia,"Squid Game is a nicely made series with decent acting and they clearly had a decent budget. Episode 1 peaks your interest and then episode 2 just draws it out and we all know what is inevitably going to happen, you can basically skip that episode. From 3 onwards is good and keeps the interest. Episode 6 was my favourite. Episode 7 onwards with the VIP's becomes annoying because they serve no real interesting aspect to the story. I feel that the ""twist"" ending was predictable as I'd thought about it prior, but it still serves purpose to the narrative.A couple of reasons why I'm only giving it a 6 is because it becomes less about the games and it encourages murder between the players. This contradicts the rules it had threatened players with prior, where no player can disadvantage the participation and/or rights of other players. I also felt the ""intruder"" role became monotonous and the climax unsatisfying with many questions left pondering. I also found the death of Sae-byeok to be a let down as I believed she deserved a better ending.Overall, worth checking out for the story, acting and questions it leaves the viewer about their own circumstances.P. S. Would you play?",7
East Asia,"What about the first 200+ casualities on the first game who didn't know they were going to die if they participate? I think the old man was kind of an ass and wasn't really a chaotic neutral character they tried to portray him to be at the end.Overall, good show.",8
East Asia,Znnznznznznnsnsnsnsnsnnsnsnsnsnsnsnsnsnsnsnsnsnnsnznsnsnznsmz.,10
East Asia,"I watched the movie because I heard from my friend this movie was good. When I watched this movie for the first time, I really liked the story line. It makes me curious. I watched episode 1 - 9 in one night.",9
East Asia,"This tv series is so entertaining. I couldn't switch it off, it hit every emotion from shock, tears and wow.A must watch if like gripping tv shows.",10
East Asia,"The first episodes were definitely hooking and story and characters were well built and interesting. But the second half got really boring and predictable. Full of of really stupid situations, non-logical story telling and absolute non-sense actions of many characters which kind of ruined it. Also, the open ending for second season...? Just finished it because...But many times, I was just in mood to turn it off...",6
East Asia,"The plot:10/10
Characters: 10/10. Cast:10/10
Everything was amazing. It is pretty short but a lot happened. Its a rollercoaster of emotions. Definitely recommend.",10
East Asia,"A pretty gripping show that has 7 solid episodes.Sadly it has one filler episode and falls apart a bit at the end, but for the most part it's a season that you can't stop watching.Definitely worth a watch and am recommending to my friends.Don't think it needs a second season but I imagine one will be made.",7
East Asia,It's a lame ending to a good show. Kind of ruins it.,8
East Asia,"Perfect to binge watching, this series holds a gripping premise into a stunningly crafted, twisty plot full of turns and jaw dropping moments. While not really perfect, this is a perfectly fine Netflix entertainment. Totally recommended!",8
East Asia,First going into this I was hesitant it seemed like a typical portrayal of an indebted person doing anything to be free however it just kept getting better each episode. Every character was very important to how the story progresses and the acting was phenomenal expect for when the VIPs arrived. I really hope they decide to continue the show for a second season.,10
East Asia,"A likely tale based on real life experiences. The elites (VIPs) participate in these types of twisted events. ""The Most Dangerous Game"" ""The Game."" Did you notice many of the movie's scenes resembled kill rooms similar to those leaked during Clinton and Podesta's #pizzagate? So ask yourself, why this soft disclosure movie full of kids' games, toys, color, and imagery? What kind of people are REALLY directing ""The Game"" and who are the INNOCENTS forced to play? This series is once again attempting to disclose the same sickness Kubrick did and was killed for in ""Eyes Wide Shut""!",8
East Asia,The dose of enthusiasm and suspense is very beautiful .. but the end was supposed to be more beautiful.,9
East Asia,"I see a lot of shows like this that start with a good idea but often fizzle out by resorting to common dystopian clichés like forgettable actors and leads, predictable plot lines and character choices, and the like.I was pleasantly surprised by Squid Game! It engages lots of different subplots in addition to the main game, and manages to make each one very invested and entertaining. If you're someone who wants some fresh takes on the thriller/dystopian scene, pick this show! It'll keep you gripping your seat, theorizing with your friends about who will live and who will die, in and out of the game itself. I had so much fun with this show and recommend it to any group of morbidly curious friends.",9
East Asia,"Intense. Massively intense!!!Games. Choices. Money. Decision.Oh what a twist! Salute to the Scriptwriter and Director, Hwang Dong-hyuk!Cheers to all the actors! It made me scream and cry!9.5/10#SquidGame.",9
East Asia,"Only 6 or 7 episodes worth of material stretched to 9.The American dialogue is pure shallow stereotype trash compared to the Korean's. You could still make them bad, but given them decent lines. Even the worst Korean parts had meaningful dialogue and had some sympathetic qualities.The script played a decent 8 and 2/3's innings. The last out could have gone for the fences, but instead was a meaningless 3rd strike check swing.",7
East Asia,"There's something about Korean shows on Netflix always hitting the gold spot. Furthermore, so excited for another season.",10
East Asia,"I came into this with high hopes being a fan of Korean and Asian cinema and was not disappointed. I wouldn't honestly put this up there with Train To Busan - it had the same level of character development - you genuinely care what happens to these characters. It also has a battle royale meets would you rather meets hostel vibe. Just don't watch it dubbed, stick with the original Korean and subtitles.",10
East Asia,"The show made me cringe on so many levels and so many times. I feel like I've seen that show many times already and the characters as well as the actors behind we're subpar, typical and very predictive.Doing a show around this kind of concept where humans are subjected to man-made situations of violence and survival, similar to hunger games, is attractive to viewers, for some reason, and it was to be expected that there'd be weird explanations on why this kind of situation even takes place. So for this part I don't blame them.What disappointed me was the VERY poor characters, their development and interactions between them. Some characters, like the bully who led it's mean boys clan, or the girl who didn't name or child and ended up with the bully, only to get ditched by him, wow that was bad acting.I know people will still be entertained by it, I just wish they'd put some more giving this kind of show more personality than the stereotypical good guy, bad guy, etc.",5
East Asia,"Here is why we wanted to say about Squid Game. I miss movies and shows like this. We haven't had anything similar for awhile. I thought the character development was top notch. I seriously cared about 8 characters. This made it fun because I had no idea who would die or win. All of the characters are flawed. There wasn't a typical hero or someone you really hated and I loved that. The acting was really really good for several characters. The directing and writing was really good. It was exciting and fun with lots of twists and turns. The concept was pretty cool and you could do sequels and it would be just as fun as long as you can find more actors as great as these. If you enjoyed the Hunger Games you will probably really like this series. My husband said it was a cross between Saw, Hunger Games and the minions (only for the outfits). I haven't seen Saw and don't like torture, but I enjoyed this. However, if you are not cool with lots of people dying you might think it's too much. Also, we all binged the season in two days and are still like wait a minute? I was thinking about this and wow, is this what really happened? Enjoy!",10
East Asia,"Curiosity got me and I started watching it. I found it thoughtful, it gave me another perspective of nowadays society. It's absolutely worth watching it, better than many other series now on Netflix. If you watched ""The Platform"" (Netflix), you will find it amazing for you.",9
East Asia,"Even though I have Netflix, I only watch when I see a trailer on a social media platform I use. What got me hooked was the simple fact when granny used her bank pin as her grand daughter's birthday, I KNEW I HAD to watch. 6.8 baby here & plus I'm part Korean.",7
East Asia,Behad bakwas..kaun de raha 8.5 isko?Such a dumb & predictable story & such a drag.Too much filmy nonsense & it drags n drags n drags. Such likeable actors but such a dumb story that you don't even want to knw how it ends & actually you won't miss much coz ending sucks too. Bhai kya bawaseer tha ye..isse achha toh tara Mehta dekh lo.,1
East Asia,A dangerous man? Great idea. But the VIPs are very poor characters.,9
East Asia,"Complete garbage soap, shallow and vapid characters, interactions, dialogue, garbage cinematography and picture quality, godawful choreography and camerawork. Scenes and setting both looking like haphazard trash, while also being excessively extended and serving no purpose at all. The show simply capitalizes on vulgarity and shock factor to attract lowbrow audiences.",1
East Asia,"Seriously this show was like watching an anime. I saw that the director did name a couple of mangas that inspired him but I was shocked this wasn't based of a manga by the same name and story. Really addicting to watch. I see all the other reviews on here dumping on the VIP's but I'll add this... While the acting was atrocious, you're not supposed to like them. In this day in age, villains are always sexy/relatable. I choose to believe the terrible acting helps break the illusion of a ""bad ass"" or a ""sexy villain"". So maybe you can see it that way as well. I have a bigger gripe with...
and I'll spoiler mark this*Spoiler****
-that one VIP got held at gun point and knocked out but he didn't even so much as complain about it to frontman.. TF? At least mention it. I was left hanging there like... So he's cool with that happening to him even though he's ""hard to satisfy"" and was attempting to be this bad dude with impossibly high standards? But that's my only gripe so I still give it a 10!",10
East Asia,"I continue to be impressed by Korean shows and movies. I really love them. This is a great show that I hope will go on. The characters are excellent, the games are anxiety-inducing and scary, and will have you dying to see what's next, and actual character development takes place throughout. I felt so many emotions watching this; I was moved. One of the biggest highlights for me was the relationship between Gi-hun and Sang-woo. The tension was built up over time and subtlety at first, and the story as a whole was done nicely. I also really liked the undercover cop/brother of the Frontman, and was heartbroken when his story ended the way it did. Everything he did was to find his brother, and what happened to him really made you disgusted with the Frontman and the whole organization.I thought the Tug-of-War challenge was the most disturbing one. To think about how it would feel standing at one side of the rope knowing you have to yank a group of people to their death so it's not done to you makes me wince.If I had to add some critique, I would agree with other reviews about the VIPs. Their acting was horrible and did not fit in with the rest of the show. But they just weren't a big enough element to really affect my rating.",10
East Asia,STRONG start! It gets its tentacles wrapped around you and slowly looses its grip midway without taking a big enough bite of your brain to leave a lasting impression. I think they tried to cram too much while also slowing the pace down. I felt the marble episode was the turning point. It really dragged its feet even tho it introduced so much more story. Had they trimmed the fat and maybe kept it to only a few episodes it could have been great but ultimately it more sinks than swims by the end.,5
East Asia,"It's nothing but something that kids who love playing gore-type, violent video games. No interesting story, just boring predictable scenes. Bad acting, cinematography is a joke. Watch it and you'll easily forget it in few seconds after.",1
East Asia,"Spoilers (sort of?)The reason I gave this a star down is purely the fact that all the good hearted people dying got me so depressed. However, I should have expected that. But aside from that everything was amazing! The story line stays entertaining throughout the whole season and only gets better. I'd watched this a thousand times over.",9
East Asia,"First, I will start by saying; this is NOT an original idea. It's been done dozens of times, especially in movies. Most recently The Hunt comes to mind, and I think I enjoyed that more.This was not a bad show, in fact the first episode really drew me in. Then they lost me with the next few episodes, but got back on track with the very strong episode 6. That's where they hit their stride.This show would have benefited greatly by making it 6 episodes instead of 9. It would have cut out all the superfluous story lines, like the organ harvesting, and based on the final episode, the whole Detective story line.I think if they just focused on the games and the people playing them (like episode 6), it would have solved some of the issues. I mean 6 games, 6 episodes. Makes sense.Oh, and I get that all of us Americans are fat, white, capitalist pigs, blah, blah, blah, but that hurt the story more than helped it. I wasn't offended by it, I just felt it didn't serve the story or stay authentic.I HATE watching dubbed, so I always watch subtitles, and it was just weird when all of a sudden everyone was speaking English. And yeah. I think they threw a Chinese guy and Russian guy into the VIP mix, but it just felt off.Then, the elephant in the final episode (not literally). But the ending. As someone who has dabbled in screenwriting, I had a feeling something was up with the old guy from the start. 001. Hmm? And then when you don't actually see him get shot I was like, yup, he's behind it. That's a fine ""twist"", but my God, his ""explanation"" was awful. And the fact he entered the game and wasn't killed by anyone or anything felt kind of far fetched. It's the kind of twist I felt like they came up with at the last minute.Then the whole Front Man/ Cop brother thing I saw coming too. But I wish I didn't as there was no resolution on it. Yeah, season 2 etc, but there should have been something that showed he was alive or something. I wasn't feeling that.And actually, the twist with the old man (for most people) was probably a major reveal and I felt like it could have been so much more dramatic or a much bigger reveal somehow as opposed Gi Hun just being like you're a bad man. And then they bet again and the old man dies happy because he made a friend and whatever? And that was the catalyst for Gi Hun to get a makeover to go to LA and go on RuPauls Darg Race, I mean finally do the right thing and go see his daughter? Which wasn't that his motivating factor all along? And then he just bails and is like, No. Katniss needs me as tribute and I'm going back to the Hunt to Survive the Game of the Hard Target Hunger Games Battle Royale style.And it kind of annoyed me at the end the card slap clip thing guy recognized Korean Annie Lennox from across the platform, hair color change and all, and just HAPPENED to be a train there for him to ""escape"" on. I guess that's another thing, just too much convince for the sake of plot. Like the guy being an expert at glass, or none of the guards noticed the one woman had to lighter to melt the Honeycomb?Also, what happened to the whole bit about the Morse code through cough? Was that just supposed to be the was 28 and 29 committed?And when the cop came in and was like, oh yeah, what was I doing yesterday? And the people jist answer him without being WTF?And last thing for me that kept it from getting a higher score, the ""rules"" kept seeming to change, depending on the episode and circumstances. I wasn't a huge fan of that.All in all, it was good, but could have been great.",6
East Asia,"(Contains mild spoiler)
What an amazing show! Korean drama of this type is so different and well done. So unique in every element - the set, filmography, costumes, plot, acting, emotion - all was just to the point.Aesthetic in a creepy way, emotional (I got all teary on the Gganbu episode), it also had so many life lessons that touched on so many aspects of life. The players there got me thinking about the fine line between good and bad. Another thing is that in comparison to the other actors, VIPs seemed to be more relaxed and preposterous as I was expecting them to be scary and serious. But that's the charm, I guess no one will be expecting those VIPs to be some old bored rich bummers.Adults playing kids games with their life at stake. Despite all those horrors that were shown in this drama, the rewatch value is 10 on 10.1 star down cause it didn't answer all the questions and I hope there will be a second season that I'll be waiting for.",9
East Asia,"The overall series is very accurate and interesting will make your interest on high octane edge. The actors have done a brilliant job, Character developments are also so impressive and fantastic. The makers should need to season 2 as soon as possible because It's been a long time since I've seen something new. Therefore, it should be taken forward.",9
East Asia,"Really interesting and different. Definitely binge worthy.Characters were well played and acted. Managed to keep tension throughout.I felt that the addition of the VIPs didn't lend anything to the story line, however I am hoping in series 2 that this will be explored more.",10
East Asia,"Having watched all the episodes in a few days this was very enjoyable. Despite the games could've been a whole lot better (Takeshis castle type?) this had likeable and hateable characters to run through the story, some bits were slow paced and certain elements shouldn't have been there and used as a time filler but all in all was very enjoyable esp episode 6. Wish more stuff like this.",8
East Asia,"So good to see a truly entertaining TV show for a change, enjoyed every single episode, a big round of applause for Korean entertainment. And don't worry about the bad VIPs, they're not in it for long and the masks are beautiful.",9
East Asia,"Every actor is fantastic performance
Great story great direction all best.",9
East Asia,"It would probably be more thought-provoking if it weren't for the glaring errors.Also, it proved to be rather something of a bait and switch. First, they say it's all about pulling oneself up by one's bootstraps but it turns out to be something quite different. Everyday, vulgar banality is all it was, after all.",7
East Asia,"It doesn't appeal at first, but if you you'll stay tuned, you'll see a really good drama series with some very well written characters.Watch it!",9
East Asia,The production was done quite well. Love the direction. Cinematography was on point. Actors did a good job. That being said the story really starts to take a turn for the worst towards the end. Branched storylines resulted in dead ends. The failed attempt at trying to be artistic and deep was quite cringe worthy in the finale. Would i watch S2? 50/50.,6
East Asia,"Good idea for a show but poor execution of it, totally overrated.",7
East Asia,"This serie could be on the top so many years.Variety of games, colors, act, scenes, suspense and even reality, who knows? Jaja.Great 1st episope at the half of it starts the action
2nd one was like... oh no are they gonna leave the games??Later on the games are spot on and the only downside is the end. Although we know for sure it will be 2nd season.Just waiting for that.",9
East Asia,I caught this on Netflix and it was a phenomenal series! I wasn't even sure I would like it but I ended up loving it! This is a creative storyline that gets pretty twisted but they were still able to add in some real sentimental parts that were surprising. Also has some mind blowing twists in it. Be prepared episode 6 is a rough one. I couldn't believe how much you end up liking certain characters so when those certain ones were eliminated it gets really upsetting.This ended where they could do another season so I looked it up to see if there were plans for it but there isn't yet. I read the director actually wrote every episode himself on top of directing it. He said if he does do another season he would use a writers table asks other seasoned directors.Do not miss out on this series!,10
East Asia,"Terrible performances from the VIPs, but not enough to ruin that fantastic tv series. This is marathon worthy: I couldn't stop watching until the end. More than the sick games, the mistery behind the main plot was engaging and the end was surprising.",9
East Asia,"Best Series I have Ever watched my whole life. I DONT think that I will ever watch a series so bingeworthy , so fun , so exciting ...
Just Amazing.",10
East Asia,The first half of the first episode might be a little boring vut the rest of the show is perfect. I couldn't stop watching till the very last minute. It's a MUST watch.,10
East Asia,"Had no idea what I was going in to, came out of some episodes with tears in my eyes.",8
East Asia,"Very original, very strange. I like strange. Ooh look at this, it is so cute and harmless like a puppy until it bites off your index finger.",10
East Asia,"So, I just finished watching the Squid Game and I have some contradictory feelings about it. For instance, some episodes get my heart racing. They're so good that you cannot look away from the screen and you start sweating in weird places!!! Then some episodes do very little character development, there is very little drama, there is very little addition to the whole series.Another thing that I think could've been improved (and maybe should be - if there is to be a second season) is that a lot of times there are enough clues in an episode where you can guess the exactly what is going on. The fact that doesn't ruin the show, must tell you how great it is. But, if you're looking for a big mystery, maybe this isn't your show, because you'll be able to guess what the heck is going on after just a few episodes.",9
East Asia,"It was a very good series, I really enjoyed it! I do like this type of genre so I was looking forward to watch it! I think that the plot was entertaining and I also think that the series took inspiration from different popular series such as Money Heist (the guys wearing red suits) or Star Wars (the guy wearing the black mask looked like Darth Vader) or even the typical play station logo with all the basic geometric shape, which I didn't mind. I also noticed that the series is pretty similar to Hunger Games and Alice in Borderland on different aspects but I still find it unique and interesting. I didn't mind the VIP acting tbh, I've seen worse and that was ok. However there is one thing that I would have changed. I would have made the evil guys on red suits more stronger and I guess more 'bossy'. Idk but I felt like on a few scenes the red suits guys weren't really that strong and able to manage the participant properly. I remember one scene where a red guy had to take off his mask in order to handle the situation with a participant (knowing that doing so, he might die!?) Are these red suits guys been trained well enough for their job or not? It just felt that they were weaker than the participants, if it weren't for the guns these red guys would have lost immediately. That's my opinion tho, It's not that big of a deal. The rest was good!Again I liked the plot, I liked the characters and the writing was good. Yes there are things that I didn't quite understand such as why did the brother killed his brother?? Just like that?? What was the purpose of the police guy if then he ended up like that? And there is moreHowever I did enjoy the series and I can't wait for the next season.",8
East Asia,"I absolutely love it! It reminds me of JIGSAW and ESCAPES ROOM. It make you feel like you are part of the squid game while watching. It will definitely leave you guessing who will survive in the end. I absolutely love HoYeon Jung acting, she's really tough, really cute and beautiful all around. I loved HoYeon Jung character, she kept to herself, strong minded, didn't trust anyone and I love her serious image. She was really amazing! I wish HoYeon Jung could stay for more seasons but unfortunately she died towards the end and I was really upset about it! It was really sad. Keep it coming for more seasons.",10
East Asia,Very interesting movie and the game seems easy yet super tricky. My favourite part is the honeycomb game.,9
East Asia,I really enjoy every second of this TV show it's so perfect and amazing it deserves 10 out of 10.,10
East Asia,"On first episode meeting the girl who stole his money was a mistake from the director because it showed how easy I could predict what happens next . Last episode has many faults
I enjoyed the series but I hoped the scenario would be smarter than what I saw ??",4
East Asia,Remarkable series but the VIPs must be the worst actors i've ever seen.,8
East Asia,"The VIP's were awful omg, and I actually sobbed when Ali and the other girl died in the 4th game. 067 is a goddess who we all should aspire to be like. Can we please force 456 to dye his hair back ??",9
East Asia,An amazing movie I love him. I recommend it to peek it's great so I recommend take a look.,10
East Asia,"Slow at times, but intense and engaging throughout. Acting was on point and I loved how they mixed different elements of society and human behavior.The only issue was the VIPs. Quite the buzz kill in terms of acting and overall performance. They didn't fit in there they way they should. Casting failGive it a watch peeps!",9
East Asia,Watch ep 6 and then u will understand why this series is so famous.,10
East Asia,"Seriously, you guys really didn't know who was behind it? Didn't you really figure out very early on who the Leader was? Every plot of this show was outrageously announced by the director/acting. I give it a 5 because the idea is excellent! Out of the box. But the execution was terrible. It is a very serious mistake to let the viewer know the most important plot of the show in the FIRST EPISODE!!!!!I understand the folks with grades 9, 10. I believe there is a little more repertoire missing.",5
East Asia,The decision making of the characters is painfully bad and most of the acting is over done and cringey. There are also random side stories and characters that have absolutely no relevance to the show.,5
East Asia,Only thing i disliked was the amount of Plot Twists. English Dub was alright.,8
East Asia,"I feel conflicted after finishing the series. After watching the 3rd episode I was hooked! Just absolutely amazing! A solid 10! I'm glad there were only 9 episodes. At this moment I'm not sure exactly when it started going wrong. I agree with others, the VIPs were awful and cliche. And regardless of how much you are into the game you wouldn't sit for hours with such heavy gold masks on! They were beautiful but completely distracting with the awful dialogue. The final episode was very disappointing. After winning the game, they throw him unconscious onto the street. I don't understand why they would stuff the bank card in his mouth. Makes no sense. Fast forward a year later and Gi-hun is a mess. He hadn't yet honored the promise he made to Kang about her younger Brother. Okay fine. And he finds out Il-Nam, the old man is still alive, which was good and bad. We never saw him die, but the reunion didn't work for me. Turns out Il-Nam is responsible for the game. Regardless, after he passes for real, Gi-hun appears to get his act together. He goes to a hair salon and dyes his hair bright pink! Why? I'm sorry I didn't find it funny or necessary. Then he visits and adopts? Kang's brother but dumps him and a load of cash with the dead 'Big Bad's' Mother! THEN it looks like he's going fly and see his son in the US but after an incident and a phone call he turns around with the look of- I'm headed back to the game? Maybe if this had been done differently I'd feel satisfied. But what started as a freaking great show, left a sour taste in my mouth. Sigh.",7
East Asia,Simply i enjoyed every single minute in the magnificent series.,10
East Asia,In my opinion they played so ridiculously bad to portrait what they think about the Americans and to mock them with their bad jokes. Their cast was really good and i dont think they just didn't get the right actors to play the Americans.,8
East Asia,"The show started good gor the couole of episodes but began to downgrade at the endings. The VIPs were awfully bad and full of cringe dialogue of 9 year olds. As for the main lead actor of the show, he was not good in any aspect. The Pakistani guy was more likable than him. Except for one episode I don't think there is any scene in which the main lead actor is useful.",6
East Asia,"The luckiest unlucky? The question, what does success mean to you? Just try to ask yourself after watching it. What a brilliant, dark, fun & fast paced show to demonstrate metaphor of capitalism. I would love to take this ride again. Excellent showcase of human mind and emotions. The acting was pretty good and the story & plot was crazy. Its the battle of strong people against the weak people covering all aspects such as morality, honesty, sacrifice, smartness, cunningness and so on. Ending was somewhat predictable bht definitely a good show. I do recommend for you to watch it.",10
East Asia,"A mix of Hunger Games, Parasite, Hostel and Saw.It shows how human nature really is.",10
East Asia,"Despite how predictable was the plot, I watched it in two days. Well done!BTW, wtf with those VIP characters at the end, they were obnoxiously cringe. Bad acting or they made them on purpose?",7
East Asia,Definitely gives viewers a good look at what people who are struggling financially with major problems are willing to do for money as well as what people with too much money are willing to do for entertainment. Planned on writing how absolutely nauseating the VIP's were in their acting abilities but SO many people beat me to it. Seriously the dialogue was so awful I was actually getting irritated whenever they were on screen and the delivery would have sounded more human if it had been robotic voices. They manage to grate on your nerves while completely taking you out of the story.,7
East Asia,"I understand its success, and I see that Netflix knows how to catch with a series (especially with such a remarkable visual production). But on a personal level, I did not enjoy it, I saw it complete just because it is entertaining, but just. It seems to me that the only way to enjoy it would be to ignore the multiple script holes and inconsistencies in the plot, or to appreciate only the technical-visual section.",5
East Asia,"Nice Korean TV show intense, funny and likeable characters.",10
East Asia,"It is an ok show nothing that great - typical netflix show.Feel free to watch it, but let the the high rating/reviews inflate your expectations
Nearly everything was really predictable and the things that weren't were of no consequence.",5
East Asia,"I literally freaking screamed. Sae Byeok was easily the best character in the show (sorry Ali) and quite obviously, the ultimate plot armor for the final game between the two men to happen.It was such a shame cause she was the only main character who never played dirty nor tricked anyone in order to win the games (ie In the red light green light game she could've pushed the antagonist who beat her up but didn't. Only used the knife she smuggled when the antagonist tried to kill her. In the marble game scene, aka the most depressing shh ever, she insisted on playing fair). Also, she was actually the only player brave enough to get insights about the facility when she snuck up in the bathroom's vent. Of all the elimination, hers was the most frustrating because she was the most satisfying winner out of the three. She was fair. Couldn't help but compare her to Usagi from Alice in Borderland. Both of them had knocked some senses into the main characters.Moreover, the actress, Jung Ho Yeon, stole the show for me despite having limited scenes. And now her being an obvious fan favorite (gaining millions and millions of followers on the gram ever since the show debuted on Netlix), I really wish they saved her up for the sequel instead.",8
East Asia,"It's the twist no one wanted. But I still thought it was a very interesting season. I watched most of it on planes and would not recommend that, I felt bad for the passengers all around me.",8
East Asia,I don't know what to say except this series is perfection. It's original and it draws you in if you give it a chance.,10
East Asia,"Just watch it. No hesitation. BINGED WATCHED IT IN ONE GO! I want moreeeee! Didn't know, how this would take me for an emotional/thrilling/suspense / unexpected roller coaster.",9
East Asia,"Binge watching till the end of the nine episodes!Anxiety, horror, anger, fear, compassion...with all the mixed feelings. Korean series are always good at capturing the humanity in people and the depression of the society. Hopefully there's Season2 coming! TBC...",9
East Asia,"Is it realistic? This game invented in 1988. Every year so many people disappear and their body never found. Why is the police thinks main role is like crazy dude. And the banks is a joke? So much potholes and predictable dialogues, actions. Meaningless deaths who bet on the who can shape their candy without break.",2
East Asia,"The series started off with a bang and it just hooked me from the very starting 1st episode and I binge-watched the whole show in 1 day.IT'S ENGAGING,VISUALLY IMPRESSIVE AND THE CHARECTERIZATION OF THE PLAYERS WERE ASLO GOOD. Though it's not a masterpiece but it's an unique take on this interesting concept. AND, ALSO I loved the CLIMAX TWIST.WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND TO ALL OF YOU GUYS!!",9
East Asia,This series has a really good storyline.You think you know how an episode goes. But it always takes a different turn.It has been very well thought out.Well done and i would say check it out!,8
East Asia,"Wow, this got off to such a great start and sustained it for 6 episodes. I liked it so much that I binge watched it. Then in episode 7 it did a face plant!! As many reviewers mention: the VIPs are unbearably ridiculous and painful to watch. But in addition to that, in my opinion, the ending is ridiculous!! Such a let down to what was a glorious series. Sorry I wasted any time at all on it!",2
East Asia,"It started good but end up pretentious.There were many things left unexplained like
1- the videos were already sent to police .2- how did the cop's brother become a master and for what .3- there were people who's supposed to take the MC kidney, but somehow and even though he never paid them back ( since he never used the money ) after a year , he still had his kidneys .4- I don't remember how many players were there but how did they manage to split into groups of tens. It doesn't make any sense .5- the cop that was shot, the body will be found and even if it didn't , he would still be remain missing, which is a huge problem since he's a cop not just a citizen.6- when the old man told his assistant to excuse him from watching the game with the vips and wanted to play with the players, the vips only watched the glass game and the old man was expelled earlier so this doesn't make sense eitherI don't know what is it with Korean drama but they always mess it up , they start good but finish badly , the acting the story line , the plot holes .My god every time they show us the English speakers characters , I just want to throw up . The whole scene , the decorations , who the heck thought of that , why ruin it .And I must finish with , if you're gonna watch this , you should watch the movie serie saw instead , it's better anyway , since this was a huge rip off.I wished that the girl would have won .. and that the MC would have ended just as greedy and betrayer as others , it would be a better story line and very unexpected since she was only a side character .",1
East Asia,Very unique storyline that entertain you each of episode and very much engaging. Each game that are featured is simple yet thrilling. You don't want to miss this one.,9
East Asia,"When they kill the doctor there is 39 of them left.The woman was moved to the next game and 38 of them went to play the marble game, but when the game was finished only 16 of them came back and it should have been 19, since they played in pairs.",7
East Asia,In our present day there is reality shows like survivor looks like the squid game but not killing but I'm surr soon we will see the real squid game in our live.The serie is very good and attractive. I like it.,9
East Asia,"I enjoyed the suspenseful ride and twisted concept of the series! Actor HoYeon Jung stood out most to me; especially after finding out it was her acting debut. Death scenes in this show comes by form of execution, which was almost too much to watch at times. Show lacks no detail within the games facility and does a great job of forming bonds and friendships in such a doer situation! Only thing I wish for was a ending that brings actor Lee Jung-jae closer to his family (daughter) at the end.... More than just a phone call was needed after leaving her standing in the rain like that ??. Overall great show, great acting, great concept, season 2 worthy Netflix!",9
East Asia,"Genuinely interesting all the way through, it plays out like a living anime. All the characters are super fun to watch and everything feels genuine. There will definitely be a few things you can call a mile away but a lot more you could never tell, no doubt best thing Netflix has put out in years!",9
East Asia,I'm in the type of person that can normally get everything that's about to happen in a movie and or shop well they were parts of this where I was shocked maybe last second I would get it but anyways it was incredible regardless of how bad the VIPs act this is one of the best shows I've ever seen in my entire life absolutely incredible.,9
East Asia,"I have watched a couple of Netflix shows, like Umbrella Academy, Stranger Things, Lupin and La Casa De Papel.But this show, is by far the best.I heard about this show by various pages throughout social media, and from a couple of friends, so I thought, lets give it a try.After the first episode, I was already in love with the show. The show is very bingeworthy.And man, what a great show this was, I hope after that ending a season 2 comes soon.",10
East Asia,"If you're looking for the stereotypical K-Drama with romance, no cussing, nudity, sex, or gore, DO NOT watch this. Netflix has absolutely smashed the Korean television stereotype out of the park - in a good way. The twists and shock that this series has is mind-bending. It will have your jaw on the floor after each episode. I'd say my only gripe is the open ending. I know 99% of K-Dramas don't get a second season, but I REALLY hope for a continuation with this one.",10
East Asia,The headline tells the most. The series in itself is great. But by the time the VIPs came i started cringeing. The Vips sound in their lines like the read it from a paper and their intonation was really bad. Otherwise great series.,8
East Asia,"A powerful series, a powerful message. Amazing experience.",10
East Asia,"+ brilliant storyline, keeps you gripped until the end
+ great acting from the main actors
+ dubbed in English was fine and easy to follow, subtitles well done too
+ really got attached to the characters, got a bit emotional in parts!left me with a lot of questions at the end of the seriesfound the ending a little frustrating, maybe I didn't understand it?!",8
East Asia,"This series really exceeded my expectations! It's almost close to perfection actually. The rules and regulations of the game isn't that unfair. Moreover, it's the most considerate survival game challenge i've ever seen. Given the fact that they themselves are the one who made the decision to participate.I can see in this series the combination of gantz, saw, the purge, money heist and alice in borderland. If i were to compare this to Alice in Borderland, i definitely would say this is better. Maybe because of the pandemic when it was release and made but nevertheless, i must say that the Squid Game has a very unique content.Games are not too complicated and not that easy but they needs some improvements. Games actually went well because of the certain roles of the players and great portrayals!And lastly im very fond of the thrills the series brings in every episode that makes you end up rushing to see the next scenarios in the next episodez.",9
East Asia,"The marble episode is simply gratuitous. There is no reason for it to be as drawn out as it is, and there is no reason to not simply imply instead of showing the deaths. Anyone who likes this episode is simply sadistic.Beyond that, the ending two episodes don't meet what one would expect from a story. Basically, you get a cliff-hanger that is misanthropic. The old man is upset that people are killing each other and he preaches about life to the main character, yet he's the force behind all of the deaths?And what about the religion that's brought in? Why go after religion when it doesn't matter to the plot?After the marble episode, I only finished the series because I thought there might be something upcoming to redeem the story. I was wrong to expect that kind of intelligent writing.This is a mess; don't waste your time.",2
East Asia,We didn't need to see foreign vip actors that wasn't necessary.,10
East Asia,"What a amazing series from start to end ,really no words .best movie or serie regarding games .Korea took it in extream beauty level .so much lessons to learn by this series .I enjoyed more then money hesit season 3.4 and 5 .thx to Netflix showing or making series like that .hates off Korea and Netflix.",10
East Asia,"Just a silly scenario, with a big investment, and a cheesy end. Please stop comparing it to Casa de Papel.",1
East Asia,"Just binged watched 4 episodes in a row. Amazing!Extraordinarily original and fresh. There are some feelings of Old Boy, Parasite and Japan's Battle Royale, and of course hints of Black Mirror (the title graphics make that very clear) - but overall the production style and content is incredibly fresh.It's best to go in without knowing much about it and just let it tell the story.I see a few here complaining about VIP acting, I have no clue what that is, but I found the acting overall very good.I don't speak Korean, so maybe they sensed more than me.Since it's mainly a character study, elements of the hapless yet hopeful fool (the main character) and stereotypical thug (the main antagonist) obviously exist to narrate the story as it progresses.Let's face it, if this was just outright brutality that would be very off-putting and just become an average SAW-type horror story, this is clearly not the intention here. Subtle messaging abounds. For your consideration.The design of the production varies from the bleak harshness of the outside world to the colourful Escher and Minecraft inspired world of the childish game itself.With Star Wars like drone soldiers mindlessly ensuring the players stay in line. Under a hierarchy based on shapes and a Vader-like controller that keeps you wondering what exactly the entire situation is about.And that's where the Old Boy feeling really kicks in. Is this controller seeking revenge from some childhood slight or is it intended as a learning experience?Overall, I would just suggest watching episode 1 and if you get hooked like me, then you've found something you will absolutely love.Can't really say any more until I'm done watching it all.But I'm going to take a break because binge watching is a crime.Or it should be. Especially given the work gone into this.Thanks for reading.",10
East Asia,Wow so exiting and good! Loved it so much! Highly recommend it you wont regret it.,10
East Asia,So fas so good but please Netflix there is no need to season 2 you will ruined it.,8
East Asia,The poor and the actors are very realistic however the vips ruined everything with the terrible acting.,8
East Asia,"As a Korean series, it was good actually. Good acting from the Korean actors, but foreigners? NO, It was extremely bad as you feel that they are just reading what they have to say
Anyways, it takes eight for all.",8
East Asia,"This is not as provocative as they want this to be. Many books and stories have the same genre of ""all humans are capable of doing bad things when pushed too hard"".",7
East Asia,"First of all, that was one of the best designs I have ever seen in my life! The idea is great but there were many flaws, like the overdramatizing, overeating some characters are just don't know how to act! The VIP actors were terrible. You get bored in the middle episodes I don't understand the hype about this show.",6
East Asia,"This tv show is very good to me, something different from what we are used to watch, for me is very original.",8
East Asia,"Very good. Worth watching, can't wait for season 2.",9
East Asia,"Squid Game is one of the most interesting and gripping shows I've watched in a while. It grabbed my attention and kept it, and while that doesn't take a lot to do, this one made me come back again and again. It's creative, the atmosphere it creates is truly unique, and it shows a horrific perversion of the human mind, both in the VIPs and the Front Man himself.The VIPs were okay. I thought the character design and writing was spot on for what they wanted to portray, but the actors were definitely sub-par. Seems like everybody has said this already though, so I don't need to say much about it.Definitely a 9/10 for me. I'll come back and rewatch it when season 2 (hopefully) airs.",9
East Asia,"This show is a masterpiece, very deep in many aspects, the only negative aspect are the VIP's.",9
East Asia,"The first episodes hit you like a hard punch in the stomach. Original and well produced series. Disturbing, bizarre and unpredictable. Many very good characters with the big exception of the VIP people that were very bad acting. Korean filmmakers show more and more their ability to make high quality dramas. You are kept on the edge of your seat for the first half of the series. Then it loses some steam and focus. The ending a bit disappointing and the opening for a second seasons feels totally unncessary. One season is enough and it is a very good watch for the not-faint-hearted-viewers.",8
East Asia,"Parasite, Saw, Hunter X Hunter, Cube, Black Mirror, The Platform, Oldboy... Takeshi's Castle?An unexpected mix of all my favourite things - Squid Game is the best thing I've watched this year.An intriguing premise that actually delivers. I went in with no expectations and was blown away!",10
East Asia,OfbjsnsnsmymmanNNKYKKYSKSMSNS S DNJJjsjsjsksksmmsmykksksksskksykykmsmsmsmyyjjyjy.,9
East Asia,This serie was mindblowing but the vips actwork was so terrible i cant give it a 10. Thankfully vips were not a major part of the serie.,9
East Asia,"With nods to 2001: A Space Odyssey (Blue Danube score and depth of meaning regarding some of the eliminations) and Battle Royale (an all out fight for survival), whilst some of the acting leaves much to be desired, the concept and plot raises this to be an addictive, binge worthy series.Granted I watched this with the English dubbing, which may lose some of the intended dialogue, but the main characters give a boost to the otherwise mediocre acting of some of the other members of the cast.The story - albeit an old one of man versus man in a primordial sense - is engaging and keeps you interested. The side story of the masked individuals is perhaps an unnecessary addition, and I found it disengaging from the main plot. That being said, if you ignore it and focus on the primary plot, it can be forgiven.Overall 8/10. Watch it and enjoy!",8
East Asia,Me and the missus really enjoyed this series we watched it all in the evening.Saying that we both thought the ending was a little too predictable and we both had an inclination about the ending from episode 2.Give it a watch by all means because there's some really good characters and action but don't expect a blockbuster ending.,7
East Asia,Nostalgia. Reminded me of the 90s where I went through a phase of buying or renting every VHS tape that had a tartan label. From there I couldn't sleep for a while! This show is very good and will hook you in. However like other reviews it is slightly ruined by the cheezy B list VIP actors! It's like they ran out of actors late in the season and grabbed a few guys from a bar! Please take note of this for the next installment as it's an entertaining show.,8
East Asia,Squid Game has an interesting plot that hooks you on the first episode. The rules of the show is ever changing though with surprises on each entry. How far would you be willing to go to play the game?,10
East Asia,"I hate movies/shows with subtitles but, I absolutely loved this show!!",10
East Asia,"Wonderful acting and great suspense, old wine on new bottles maybe, but tapped in a way that will surprise you all the time.Please watch it with the Korean voice acting and not the dubbed English, no matter your native tongue, it will give the show much more depth for you.I absolutely loved this series until the episode where the vip's came along and almost completely ruined it for me. Still good, but they took it down at least a few stars.",8
East Asia,"Long time viewer of both Netflix and K-dramas, and this one is a fantastic blend of the best of both. The amazing, succinct story-telling from Korean dramas plus the uncensored gore, cursing, and production quality of a Netflix original. This show is unpredictable, well written, well acted, and extremely unique. When I initially saw the premise/trailer I thought it was going to be a copy of Alice in Borderland, and while there are similarities, there are a ton of differences that made each one unique (I liked Squid Game better).For the love of all that is holy, PLEASE watch the original Korean language version with subtitles. The dub actors did okay, but the speech and inflection nuances are left out. Plus the English dub seems to go off the subtitles rather than the actual language, (I can understand some Korean) so there are definitely some liberties taken that change the meaning/tone of certain scenes and characters.For those who are complaining about the VIP's: yep, that is a trademark of K-dramas, using bad actors for the English/foreign characters. I recognized some from other K-dramas, and their acting is unfortunately stiff and subpar. Perhaps now that the show is so popular and may even get a second season, future foreign characters will be played by decent actors.Either way, this show is a great, gory thriller that has a thought-provoking underlying message: what would you be willing to do for money?",8
East Asia,"Seriously, 10/10? A true thriller fan would find this painful to watch.",3
East Asia,"Watching Squid Game makes me think about a lesser known horror movie ""Would you Rather"". Same concept of people participating on a game for money and ends up all being dead except the main character who goes home with the money but with a dead loved one. Acting is pretty good, as well as the effects, but the plot was predictable right after they came back to the game. The MC's actions feels unrealistic, suddenly making an enemy out of his friend after he actually just barely saved all of them at the stepping stones. He also didn't do anything about his daughter who was the whole point of him joining the game. The police man intruder sub plot feels more like a filler since it doesn't do anything about the actual plot, it could have been entirely erased from the story and won't change anything about the outcome. Even the old man twist at the end doesn't really do much about everything. Overall, still pretty watchable and a nice way to kill some time during Pandemic. Hopefully, if Season 2 does come, they could connect all those plot holes and make it work.",7
East Asia,"First I hate not having the option of listening in the original language with English subtitles. No option other than dubbing...my absolute least favorite way to watch. Now, the acting, or rather overacting big time. The main protagonist is an absolute waste of space and acts like Jerry Lewis on acid! The overacting and drivel dialogue makes it a ZERO, but not possible here.",7
East Asia,"One of the best series i have every watched! It gives you suspense, drama and exciting moments. The plot becomes more and more interesting as the episodes go. The characters are well established, the performances are exceptional. Please do watch it!",9
East Asia,"Another series were it keeps you on your toes, but then the ending has you scratching your head. Why?????",6
East Asia,"I genuinely enjoyed this show from beginning to end. A true social commentary on humanity, competition and avarice. When the carnage is occurring it's nail-biting and between the games you get compelling human drama - a fantastic addition to the ""kill game"" genre that seems to always be elevated by Korean talent behind and in front of the camera.",8
East Asia,"The first couple of episodes a very well done and pack a punch, but by the end it just seems to run out of steam. The marbles episode was the last real swerve, after that it becomes paint by numbers to the point that I started fast forwarding through most of it just to get it to end.Early episodes are an eight, final episodes are a three.",6
East Asia,"Even tho some elements fall flat, what works in this show works brilliantly. Whether the stunning visuals, gorgeous set designs and production value, interesting and likable main characters, spot on casting, the suspense of an engaging and unique story, decent plot twists, dark and mature subplots rarely covered in mainstream tv, good acting and more. I myself would also take great notice to the second episode, ""Hell"", that really makes great effort into showing realistically the sad backstories of our characters to justify why they would even put themselves in such situation.The flaws include a couple of bad performances, the VIP's seem like a really wasted opportunity to actually have memorable villains instead we got generic and awful eye-rolling performances, some decisions are questionable, the whole plot line of the cop had an underdeveloped ending that made the subplot feel pointless and underwhelming etc.But overall i def recommend this series as it is unique and engaging in a way that will leave you enjoying every minute of it and asking for more.",8
East Asia,"This is a great show at first i thought ""Squid Game"" what a awful name but i got tons of good recommendations to watch it so i did and it was GREAT!!! Acting was good and the plot wad always aligned you can pretty much but two and two together towards the end if your smart but for most who can your in for a big surprise anyway good show. I recommend all to watch this masterpiece.",9
East Asia,It's an amazing take on a really dark side of entertainment and games.,9
East Asia,"Sorry. That's a crude summation of this brilliant series. It's a brutal, tense satire on the economic systems we are all trapped in. Would those who lose most at the game, who gamble and get into debt far beyond what they can repay as wage slaves, would they risk their lives to be free? Of course; they would play the Squid Game.Motivations and characters are carefully fleshed out. The concept of the games we play as children having life & death consequences in adult life is intelligently, deviously developed. It combines quality, international art house drama style with thrills & bloody horror. If you're ready for something challenging and intense play the Squid Game.",10
East Asia,"The Cinematography is good, not boring as a series.",8
East Asia,Series was tracking as a solid 7 or 8 prior to the last episode. All of the finishing 'revalations' and gotchas were just plain stupid and not needed. Otherwise great upto that point.,2
East Asia,"Since you're here it's not really possible to tell you to go into the series not knowing anything about it, like I did. I read something about the VIPS being poor actors so I was constantly looking for them VIPS who eventually play a minor role at the end of the series.I see some people giving the series such a low score because of it, but in my opinion you're doing the series no good by that.I had such an amazing time with the series and tried not to finish it too fast. Eventually I finished it in 3 runs but I could finish it in one run it's that fun.The series never follow the American standardized way of a build up and the way choices are made. There were many moments where I expected something to happen where the opposite happend.The series is fast and original with great actors. Yes there is a lot of gore and violence, but fast enough you'll see it's not (solely) about that. Especially the episode Gganbu is some of the best I've ever seen in a series.If you're doubting about seeing it; give it a try, it is amazing!",9
East Asia,"The story, the motif is great, but the conversation, the acting between characters are so lame.It could be a cultural things that Koreans speak that way.Just my opinion. Take it or leave it.",7
East Asia,"I truly enjoyed this show from the beginning but eventually less and less when people started comparing it to some of the greats.Squid Game is meaningful and has a strong message against capitalism but what people fail to see somehow its a rip off of Alice in borderland..In a nutshell, You will enjoy watching this but don't let the hype get to you.",7
East Asia,I have an account for 10 years on IMDB but it will be my first review. I had to write it because I'm so angry at this stupid show.This show is so so so dumb and predictable. Already in the second episode I knew that this was the old guy plot to relive his younger days (the black and white footage) and that the last stand will be between those two colleagues. It was also very apparent that the brother of the policeman will be either one of the VIPs or the front man. 9 hours wastedThe show is only saved by the great acting.Never again.,2
East Asia,"The sereal started very interesting. You dont know why happening this, who is behind this, and what kind of child game thay will play. But after episode 7 when the vip-s arrived, the whole concept are turnd up side down. All the serial become predictible, like im feeling my self as a precog. Who is the vip-s, who is the firshand whatever. That makes from 8 star to 7. But is still a good seral. A new type of battle royale. But the most annoying thing is, the concept was the child games, and that is gone when the vip-s was arrived. Why this concept changed? That was the moment when i changed my mind ftom 7 to 6 star. And of course the vip-s are super lame, but the concept change are way more worst than bad acting.",6
East Asia,"Great story, great pacing and visually, it packs a punch! It is similar to Battle Royale however, it delves deeper and provides great character development and a real feast for the eyes in terms of the colourful sets and and costumes. It's raises many questions around humanity and how far you would go to help others or save yourself.It's a wild ride from the moment it begins and the relatable characters really draw you in. There have been a lot of comments about the VIPs - just ignore those! The version of the film I watched is dubbed so maybe there's a reason for the slightly off-pace intonations; but that doesn't take away from the performances.It's certainly binge worthy and if you can handle the odd violent scene, then go for it!",9
East Asia,"I do love my typical hero's journey Marvel/DC movies/series but this one was something different entirely, a breath of fresh air.Unexpectedly I opened up my Netflix account and this show's plot synopsis grabbed my attention. Next thing I know I'm getting pulled all the way through an unexpected 1-day binge session (about 9 hours).The show is slow at times yet never boring, just taking its time between brutal fatalities (and brutal they are). The characters are troubled, each of them with their flaws (even the main character). That too felt fresh compared to the typical Hollywood protagonists who always seem to be so likable with a ton of charisma and humor.Creative story wise but also in its graphics. I loved the looks of the location with its game rooms and the characters. Speaking of Marvel, the costume of the Frontman would make a great Dr Doom outfit.Anyway long story short, just go watch it. You won't regret it.",9
East Asia,"The series, Kalash Jamila, from Iraq, I wish, Part Two, Asun.",9
East Asia,"At some scenes, the actors are overacting. The cinematography is not too good. There is a nonsense part, where they play that rope game, why the old man's hands gotta be locked if he was the maker of this game? And yeah, they not supposed to be blame each other players in that arena! The ending is just ruined all the previous episode. Peoples need to see hunger games before they say that this is the best korean series -_-",1
East Asia,"Good theme, but story developed in a bad way. POOR DIRECTION
Idle for 2hr movie release than that of an 9episode series.",5
East Asia,A unique film and a nice concept. I was enjoying this series until the VIPs arrived and ruined it in about episode 5 or 6. I think these VIPs just happened to be teaching English in Korea at the time and applied for some extra cash. The acting was horrible and severely cheapened the whole film. It left a bad taste in my mouth for the rest of the series unfortunately. I can't recommend this film to family because the acting form the VIPs is just so embarrassing.NETFLIX - remove/replace the VIPs with real actors - budgets can't be that tight.,7
East Asia,"This show is incredible and sad at the same time because it shows us human nature in a world dominated by the value of money, how far we can go by having money on one side and how sick those who have money are, in short we are doomed for money.",10
East Asia,"I haven't read any reviews yet but I don't have to for this one. This was a little slow to pick up, cliché, predicable, has some spotty acting, and I didn't like the progression of the games or the last episode. Those are all my nitpicks and even with those, I still feel like I have to give this a ten.So, why the ten? This just reminded me of Breaking Bad and A Game of Thrones when it should have reminded me of Battle Royale and so on. This is because I simply chewed through this content. The character development is amazing, loved the anti-capitalism overtone, the scenery was great, the dubbing was very well done, the acting for the most part was topnotch and there are some really good memorable, quotable and heartfelt moments. I'll keep it short. If the trailer interested you, you probably won't be disappointed.""Everyone is equal here"" ""You think money can fix everything""?",10
East Asia,"Promising storyline, interesting plot points, with a realistic cultural context aswell as the social dispute. Squid Game has many interesting and unique elements trough out the show while showcasing our present reality and how cruel it may be, with a decent written script and great acting. The only cons about the show is defiently the VIP's acting and the ending. Would recommend.",7
East Asia,"I think I haven't seen a more creative kdrama than squid game. And you can really see the hardwork and dedication the director has put into this great work of art.The characters, their motivations,cinematography, acting ,everything is top notch. Only complaint I would have would obiviously be VIPs but nonetheless best drama from korea till now.",9
East Asia,The people's bar hit that low ? People who whatched real thrills they really think that is enjoyable!? Or it is all about the tik tok generation. The public tatste tendency is horrifying.,1
East Asia,"Pretty well done, This series is heavily inspired by the anime Kaiji.If you like this series, you should give it a try the anime version, which is kinda old but good!Story is great, actors are average but story covers for them!",8
