North America,"The intrigue of Bridgerton comes from its tangled ecosystem of friends, frenemies, suitors, and voyeurs. The most exciting moments often come not from scenes of bombast but in the whispers that shape the season. There are men in this story, all of whom are interesting and often deeply alluring, but this is a show most concerned with the plight and passions of women. It does not feel the need to force high-concept drama or unnecessarily soapy details into their lives to make them interesting. There are romps in the meadows, kisses in the rain, and meddling mothers at tea-time, and it is all executed with such delicate flair that Bridgerton makes the usual fresh again. This is not just a show that takes its own concept seriously: It's one that respects the romance genre as a whole, and I cannot tell you how much of a relief it is to see that, especially given how widely ignored or derided romance novels are by the cultural mainstream. Van Dusen has enough trust in both his source material and the very concept of a Regency romance saga. The show gives every character in this vast ensemble room to breathe and the attention their unique plights deserve.
Creator Van Dusen makes Bridgerton's many twists and turns satisfying to the end, even when they're predictable, and the young cast of mostly unknowns brings zip and depth of feeling to material that could otherwise feel slight. There's a charming wink to it all - this is a show that knows exactly what it is, and wears its corset proudly.",7
North America,"Here are my thoughts#1. I have to note that I had reservations about this when I first saw the casting of Simon and other POC actors. As a black women I didn't know if it was pandering to my ethnic group or if it was for genuine inclusivity. And after seeing Simon on screen I must say that he is PERFECT!! I literally can't picture him otherwise (and I've been picturing him for over a decade. (I also have to say the same for lady D))#2. I was surprisingly pleased with the Marina character (btw she's not new to the series. Just early). She will fit in like a puzzle.#3. I'm enjoying how flushed out Anthony is. I admit he was a little 1D for the first book since he wasn't a main character so I appreciate that tv allows him more dimension and build up.#4. The rest of the siblings are excellent too. The seeds of their characters are coming through.5. The visuals, directing, and music reminds me of a TRUE historical romance book. This doesn't feel like a made for tv show. I love how they managed to make the colors so beautiful and vibrant unlike other historical romance movies/shows that have everything ""accurately"" bleak.This series was my very first introduction to the romance genre of books when I was a little girl and I could not have asked for a better pilot episode. The characters, the chemistry, the intrigue, the intensity (this list goes on and on) is exactly how I pictured it and how I felt when I first read this series years ago.To all those that worked on this series , everyone from the actors to the crew, your artistic talent has not just made beautiful period piece show. No, your artistic talent has magically translated all the beautiful things I love about historical romance books and the writing of arguably the most famous HR author of modern times perfectly to the screen and to that I thank you from the bottom of my heart.",10
North America,"This is such a good!!!!, The soundtrack and the story is amazing!",10
North America,"That Regency London was so ethnically diverse? Apart from that (which was laughable), it was an entertaining way to spend Christmas Day afternoon after a hectic lead up to the day and a tummy full of food. I've certainly watched far worse and frequently, sadly.",5
North America,"I first read the books years ago and this adaption has done it justice. Perfectly cast. The people obsessed with the ""diversity"" should know that this isn't a factual historical show, but a version of Georgian history that lives in the minds of all of us who love this type of thing and really need to get over it. They also didnt play string quartet versions of ""bad guys"" or ""thank u next"" back in the early 1800s. Basically, it's what I've dreamed of and waited for!Adore that they've kept the main storylines but complement them with lines that add, rather than subtract to the main line.Thank you Shondaland!",10
North America,"Let me just start that I am a fan of the books so I am watching this as I did when I watched all the live actions of Pride and Prejudice, with eyes finally getting my wish of seeing my fave books come to life, and I was not disappointed. Is it a masterpiece? NOT AT ALL. Is it accurate to the books? Not so much but they did get the heart of it. There's a lot of issue I find with it but somehow I still find myself watching it because I love the genre.To note: If you are into the ACCURATE retelling of history then I'm telling you right now SKIP THIS. This isn't about the accurate retelling of history. So if the ""diversity"" and ""wokeness"", the designs of their costumes, the way they acted takes you away from the story because of inaccuracy then you will have a bad time. This isn't a documentary. This isn't a biography. This isn't a true story.Now first of, the books star different siblings so each season will focus on different Bridgerton with splice inserts of side stories. S1 is more steamy and shoves a more lustful play on their romance it's a fake love turned real love trope. S2 is a slow burn and might be boring for some as it is less steamy, it's an enemies to lovers trope.Now. If you're into the book series do give this a try! Of course it wouldn't be 100% accurate but I did feel that it was very true in how romance book genre goes. It's like a whimsical romance. Glazed over. Or whatever term. Something like those Hallmark Christmas romance movies but with more mature scenes. Modern music made classical. They really brought to life the family dynamic of the Bridgertons. I love how they interact with one another as a family.Finally. If you're just looking for a Pride and Prejudice or historical setting romance show then do give this a try! You might just like it.",8
North America,"Another Shonda Rhimes hit! Loved it!For those low ratings, don't listen. If you read the comments, they all have the same theme, ""divers."" Not sure what divers have to do with the show but...oh well!I enjoyed the diverse cast :)",10
North America,"Yes embarrassing what a way to ruin a book, ruin history. It upsets to think that Julia Quinn who wrote the source material that was so well researched in all areas sold her rights to made into this drivel. I hate to say Julia Quinn. Who was my go to re-read will never be re-read again. I am so sad the someone should sell her vision to be made into this embarrassing Tosh. I admired writers who hold on to their dreams, Rowling, Meyer and even EL James.
Just so so embarrassing!!!!!!!!",1
North America,"I wish people would look beyond colour. It's a factious period drama. So what if black people are Dukes, ladies etc.",10
North America,At least we would have gotten more of the actual story as written. I can't believe Julia Quinn agreed to this unrecognizable adaptation to a truly enjoyable story. This trashy novella was not worth putting on film.,1
North America,"According to most, current and pressing issue with this show is diversity however the true fault in this show is it's acting and plot - the fundamentals of creating a good show. The plot is, to put it simply, incoherent and ridiculously produced. I could not work out whether or not the show was a parody! In addition, the acting is shocking and a true insult to modern theatre. I was terribly disappointed. Usually I like to be introduced to new actors and shows, but this offensive portrayal of aristocrats and the below-average representation of film actors left me with nothing but second-hand embarrassment and disgust.",1
North America,"It's a one time watch. Acting is decent.
The Narrator sounds like Gossip Girl.",7
North America,"I binged the entire season right after it dropped! Like JQ's well-written books, I couldn't put it down!!",10
North America,"I absolutely loved it..
it's classic and romantic and enchanting.. love the cast.
it's perfect for everyone who loves the old classics.",7
North America,"Facing a Christmas Day at home alone this splendid release was perfection.
I'm halfway through and I'm in love with Simon the very handsome darcyesque Duke, and the lovely Daphne and the Jo March frustrated Eloise. It is gorgeous to look at. It is witty and warm and faithful to the romantic ( or even erotic ) literature it is based on. The hand touch between Simon and Daphne is far more sensual than anything written or portrayed in Fifty Shades. Just luscious !",8
North America,"The sets, the costumes, and the cast make this regency romance sparkle.",9
North America,"There are a lot of aspects of this period drama to be criticized but i'm here to make a shallow comment on the lead actress. I've loved much worse quality period dramas if actors brought the emotions to me. But this Daphne girl...she's like a formless white piece of canvas , she looks like twelve and it's so awkward to watch her live an ""adult"" life.",6
North America,"This show is so far the best adaptation from this gender, I can see how some people is going to be unhappy over all the changes but In my point of view all changes came from help it!
I love how they gave us something we was asking but also some details we did not know we wanted, as any adaptation.
I'm also deeply happy that they kept all the important moments but changed the lines.
Regé is PERFECT for Simon role, Phobe was able to make Daph even better then the original character.
Even this small detail about Anthony falling in love and having a broken heart over his affair with Siena, which we do not see in the books at all, was a good thing from the place I stand.
It's a DRAMA show and that's precisely what Shondaland gave us. I can't wait for more.",9
North America,The charm of Julia Quinn's Bridgerton novels is in the truly likeable and engaging characters. The tv shows has made them bland and obnoxious. Unlike some reviewers the diverse casting doesn't bother me. The terrible adaptation of some of my favourite novels does. God awful. I can't get past the first episode it's just a travesty.,1
North America,"Such a fun and joyful experience to watch. Love the casting, truly some of the dreamiest actors around!",10
North America,"Halfway through I already fell in love with this show. The characters are beautifully chosen and I like their acting. The story is light but yet entertaining.I haven't read the books so can't say anything about accuracy, but most of this downrating reviews can't barely hide their racism.In this show I feel that it doesn't matter which colour we are and it's a nice thought, that history had gone the way it's told here.Well done Shonda! And haters gonna hate ...",10
North America,"We have all seen movies or tv shows that are based on our favorite books/series. Some have been horrible: Flowers in the Attic, Montana Sky or any other of the Nora Roberts books, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, The Hunger Games. I could go on but you get my point. As I watch Bridgerton, I am enjoying the similarities and differences from the book series. I think the diverse cast makes the show all the more interesting. The actors and actresses do a great job of telling the story, Daphne and Simon have great chemistry. The whole cast is wonderful. True fans of Julia Quinn and Shondaland will appreciate the great performances. Looking forward to additional seasons.",10
North America,"Ever since hearing this was going to be made into a series I have been anxiously awaiting it. This series has gone beyond my expectations. I love the costumes, the pageantry, and above all the cast. Each character is very well represented by the actor/actress portraying them. I love the addition of a diverse cast. It in no way detracts from the story and makes it a beautiful representation of today's society.
I was nervous at first that the move to the big screen would not carry over the beauty of the story but I am happy to say that I am in no way disappointed. This is a great series and I highly recommend it to everyone loved the books or just loved a great romance.",10
North America,"Eloise and Lady Danbury are by far my favorites but I liked it all overall, quite different than the book but keeping essential plots and the essence.
I do love the diverse casting.",10
North America,"For me it wasn't about skin, but about beloved heroines from the book. I was expecting some familiar vibes, but no. We have foolish Anthony, Simon and od course Daphne. We have younger but plain mrs. Danbury. And oh, no, mean, stupid Penelope, my favorites.",1
North America,"I see people crying here that 18th century London was as white as white could be and they have given rating 1 without watching more than one episode (written clearly in their review, thus actually they are unfit to review this ) but as racism is filled in their mind they are saying let the history be accurate when the story is BASED ON NOVEL NOT HISTORY!!!!!!!!I liked the story and beautiful cast and by the way I have seen half the season",8
North America,"I have read all the books and I enjoyed it. I was very excited about this tv show. When I saw the trailers I was a little bit disappointed because the actors where not like I imagined them in book. But after I started watching I really enjoyed it. Yes, there are some differences in plot, new faces like Ms Thompson, but its cool. I would say that maybe has more vivid plot that book itself. Yes, ofc it would be nice to follow the basic plot, but its just fine for me. Diversity is fine too. It's all part of our creativity and imagination.",8
North America,"This is ridiculous! The acting is barely okay, it's superficial, the mix of ages doesn't work for me! Maroon 5 or Billie Ellish have nothing to do in a ballroom in the 17th century. Some rules have to be respected to be true to period dramas. I had great expectations but....",1
North America,Disney and merchant/ivory have had a love child. Guaranteed to fill you with self loathing as you binge it to the end.,4
North America,"I am well aware of Quinn's Bridgerton series, but people are not focusing enough on things such as directing, plot, acting, etc. Who cares if there weren't black aristocrats? This point keeps dragging and it's honestly quite pointless. Quinn herself expected a very inclusive cast and a re-interpretation of the series. Stop wasting your energy in worrying about ""pc culture."" Have some imagination.Now, the plot is predictable for a novel series like this. I chose to watch it with my mother and it was enjoyable like an afternoon conversation with friends. Nothing deep really, lack of subtlety. But that doesn't have to be a bad thing. People often forget who are watching series and films, forgetting that some may not understand the undertones of a message. Bridgerton's lack of subtlety is beneficial for them, for my mother who doesn't understand English aristocracy because of our background. She loved the series.It is a VERY colorful setting. Wonderful clothes and scenery. There is a lot of individuality represented through that. Some characters certainly felt re-interpreted from the original material. For example, I hadn't imagined anyone with particularly loud personalities, mainly in presentation. The series provides this. Admittedly, Daphne was an absolute bore many times. I was not passionate about Thompson. So basically, some characters were louder, some were more tame when compared to the original. At times I welcomed the change, but not every time.Anyway, I look forward to the progress of this series. I also look forward to people relaxing a bit and trying to understand that media enjoyment is different for others. Literature majors may scurry away from the predictable and superficial, but (for example) someone whose main language isn't English and has always lived in a low-middle class neighborhood may feel welcomed into a different culture and may start a learning opportunity. It's not about absolute accuracy, it's about captivating our attention at first sometimes.Oh and also, I don't think the subtitles in Spanish are the best. There are words that change tone when translated. I listened as I read the subtitles. I had to re-translate a few times so my mother.",7
North America,If you enjoyed historical romance with a bit of scandal and swoons thrown in then this series is for you. The historical accuracy is nearly zero but the series was well told as it almost retold the novel. It was as captivating as the book and an easy watch,8
North America,"Full marks to the cast and crew to bring our beloved characters to life from the page! Though there are some major diversions from the books, the stories of all main characters remain essentially the same. It does give us readers something different to look forward to, some surprises!Absolutely loved the cast. They are inch perfect. Acting is stellar and I had no trouble imagining them to be exactly who they portray! Thanks for bringing the Bridgertons to life, all of you. Looking forward to season 2 already!",10
North America,So refreshing to see the heart of a story embraced!,10
North America,"Overall I really enjoyed the series, the characters were interesting and all the scenes with the siblings were funny and realistic. Episode 6 was very problematic, and I wish they didn't include it. Also, the lgbt rep was pretty lousy, laughable even.",8
North America,"A gorgeous-looking drama based on Julia Quinn's bestselling romance novels. This adaptation is fresh, exciting and a whole lot of fun. Think Austen and Gossip Girl, mixed with Downton, The Crown and perhaps a dash of Outlander. A splendid regency romp with a spectacular cast that are perfect as their characters. Sit back, relax and enjoy some good fun. Absolutely cannot wait for season 2.",10
North America,"Its a great series. Not supposed to be the books, but a different version inspired by them. I like the diverse cast and the amazing costumes. I've been a Julia Quinn fan since she started writing and I think this series does the Bridgerton books proud.",10
North America,"Absolutely fantastic show, for lovers of the books and the new finders through the Netflix series. Julia Quinn's fantastic and well loved Bridgerton series was wonderfully turned to film by the people at Shondaland and gave it a new light. The brothers and sisters of the Bridgerton family tell their stories in a steamy way, and you get to see them in a new light. Best thing that's come out this year!",10
North America,Awesome series. Can't wait for more! The costume and cast were great! Loved how the book was brought to life.,10
North America,This is the best!!!! You must watch it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,10
North America,"The series is fast-paced, witty, fun, sexy, and everything from the actors to the production are extremely pleasing. Episodes that have no boring parts that you just want to skip over like other series. A modern touch on Regency romance that viewers around the world can enjoy.",10
North America,"I started watching this series and I must say that I really enjoyed it! This series is fun to watch, especially if you like Gossip Girl. The costumes are well chosen and the characters are fun to watch as well. It is not an accurate representation of the 18th century.
However, it is a series, which is why it does not have to be. Diversity in a series is good! In my opinion, netflix did a very good job with the cast and the entire series.",9
North America,"Thank you Shonda Rhimes for your exquisite talents! The writing, the wit, and casting was well done! You gave a modern take on the period drama. Mere morals are not worthy.",10
North America,Should have made it more realistic for the place and time period. But once again Hollywood has to impose their social justice narrative! I started to watch it and quickly realized how unrealistic it was and what Netflix was once again doing with their racial obsession. How about we remake Roots and Porgy snd Bess with all white actors!,5
North America,"Only two episodes in, but highly recommend for its almost perfect blend of genres with a delicate touch of mystery, comedy, lust and scandal. Once I lowered my expectation of a deeply moving drama and relaxed into Shondaland's virtuoso ability to entertain, Bridgetown becomes most entertaining. Nowhere near a Marie Antionette, but could classify with Downton Abbey.",7
North America,I loved it! I watched and finished Netflix in 2020 but this today on xmas day was such a delight. I need season 2,10
North America,"I had to stop watching after just a few episodes. I personally see nothing wrong with the diversity of the cast, accept the fact that the acting is just a no. The accents and voices seem so unnatural that when the writers try to capture over hearts it honestly made me cringe. The leading actress has vertically no personality and might as well be a plank of wood (I haven't gotten too far but still), and because of this I was more interested in the supporting couples. The set and wardrobe are really quite beautiful tho so I guess that counts for something (the only reason for the 3 stars).
I just hope that for the sake of my mother, who has decided to continue, the series get better!!",3
North America,"For the first few minutes, I was wondering if it were a SPOOF but I found I was wrong .",4
North America,I am thoroughly entertained and thrilled by this show's revolutionary vision!,10
North America,"I would probably give this series a higher rating if I had not read the book. Daphne and family bears little resemblance to the characters that Quinn created and that I fell in love with.Daphne is not a ""diamond of the first water"" in fact she is quite on the shelf. Her brother while being defined as a rake has always put his family first. Violet Bridgerton would have never allowed her son to speak to her as Anthony did in the first episode. The only characters that roughly resemble the book are Eloise and Simon.I have no issue with color of any of the actors; however it does seem a bit forced. That said the only reason why I gave this 4 stars is because of Page's performance.I waited so long for this and feel like the wonderful Bridgertown family and the differences between them and the normal 1800s British families have been so violated.",4
North America,"Beautiful story, cinematography, and cast. Definitely recommend.",10
North America,"That's it. Just perfect. Watch it. I've seen it all at once on Netflix. The books are quite good too, but you don't have to read it to watch the show.",10
North America,"It is as good as I expected from the trailer. I have waited for a few months and I didn't regret it at all. One thing that I don't like is just it is come to an end-I demand for the second season to come next year!! I have finished it in one sitting because the very first episode has captured me perfectly! Oh, and also, Rage-Jèan is my new obsession for the whole month!!!",8
North America,"I do not have a problem with diversity or that this series does not align perfectly with history... but my problem is that it is a period piece. And while they did not hold to truth on the race of aristocrats - you should expect this when it is a Shondaland production, think Hamilton - the issue is they held true on the language used and the seriously deep misogyny. It is almost every line and well, the very theme of the series of events that take place to show the eligible women off to marry a wealthy man.I cannot watch much more of this... so far I'm at 18.5 minutes... and I'm very disappointed.Rule of thumb for me, with all that is out there to watch or even re-watch and might I add READ as well... there is no shortage of entertainment. At 18 minutes my attention should have been grabbed. Rather I picked up my iPad to bang out a note of warning over my complete disappointment with this series.Unless you are a HUGE fan of period pieces, flat acting, misogynistic themes (a woman better get married or suffer the life of a spinster; ""after she went and ruined herself"" UGH!) and as I've seen from the other reviews if you are able to overcome the racial diversity that was not even remotely true (again think Hamilton) - then be my guest.But for me, there is enough oppression out there for women without having to slog through eight 50-minute episodes reminding us how poorly women were and are still treated.For me this is a solid PASS!",1
North America,"This show is well made, nice costumes, good actors. It deserves at least 7 stars or more. Love the soundtrack as well. Some people are just haters for no reason.",9
North America,"Like Gossip Girl meets Downton Abbey. Is that a good thing? Maybe for a few escapist trashy hours, but like gossip girl, the fun probably wears thin and it becomes a boring rehashed soapy plot that no sets and costumes can save after three or four episodes.",3
North America,"Costumes are great. The sets are perfectly lush but I really don't care for the writing, the acting or the pacing. People screaming for historical accuracy need to get over themselves.",3
North America,"The reviews for every film are usually justified, except for this one. All the bad reviews are because of diversity. However, let me remind you that it was never meant to be historically accurate.
It is a great quality tv show where black people are equal to white and not portrayed as servants only. Finally, children will be able to sympathize with the main hero instead of asking their parents why are we portrayed as slaves in nearly all movies. The main message here is to imagine new dawn for humanity, which some time ago were two separate societies divided by color until a king fell in love with a queen. Love conquers all and can change everything. Be kinder.For anybody who wants to watch a visually stunning tv series, with great actors, and a captivating story - give it a try.",10
North America,"I read this book many years ago and can see why Julia Quinn's series would be made into a TV series. I am glad it has been developed a bit more as times have changed and character backstories have more depth. It's like the easy beach reads have had a 'Chilling Adventures of Sabrina' glow up. I have no issue with the diverse actors used, as they all act well, and the female characters while understanding their role in life (making good marriage connections and producing heirs), they mostly understand and strive for more. I like the use of modern music, dances and costuming, which together make the series feel modern. The broody rake-ish type is a bit repetitive and yet we still love that (plus Regé-Jean Page gets topless). Stand outs are Adjoa Andoh (Lady Danbury),Nicola Coughlan (Penelope) and Claudia Jessie (Eloise) are brilliant too",8
North America,"Look, if you want a costume romp and to forget the setting, this is your lot. Everything is so obviously an American writing on British historical society that the facts and manners are not so much ignored as put on a ship, sailed out of Portsmouth and roundly cannoned to the depths. All the British actors on set must have been falling about between takes with laughter at the whole shebang! Enjoy for the story. I'd say The Crown was more historical than this flight of fancy....",5
North America,"Waiting all season to see Julie Andrews unmasked as the Lady Whistledown and then it's little Pen. I do love a ""wow, did not see that coming"" moment. All though hard to follow, it is not an easy watch. The cast each delivered good performance for the 1800's but stand out performances for me came from Elrose, Antony and Lady Delacorte. Nice touch with making modern music instrumental to suit the era. All in all not a show I will watch twice but I'm glad I did.",10
North America,Loving it so far. Read all the books and this is such an enjoyable show.,10
North America,"Beautiful settings and couture.
Nice story of daily worries of the so called upperclass",10
North America,"I enjoyed it a lot. the acting and everything, good to find a good show during this year",9
North America,"First off, the inaccuracy in this show doesn't come from black aristocrats as so many people have been complaining about. Clearly, these people are uneducated idiots with no comprehension of English History, particularly in the late 18th and early 19th century, who have also never watched the film 'Belle', based off the TRUE story of Dido Elizabeth Belle, a mixed-race British heiress, born into slavery, taken back to England by her father and raised by an Earl. So the idea of black aristocrats is not so ridiculous as these ignorant, foolish ""critics"" complain about it being. (Not all black people were slaves in England, maybe try looking at black communities that existed during Elizabeth I's reign who were ordinary people and not slaves to correct your clearly ill-informed assumptions - particularly the BBC's article entitled ""Britain's first black community in Elizabethan London"").
Now that that's cleared up, I will say that this is historical fiction/romance, and as always, allowances can be made for historical inaccuracy because the 'history' part is often less important in these sorts of stories than the romance, and I'm certainly not watching this for historical accuracy - if I wanted that, I'd watch something on the Smithsonian channel.
I don't normally go in for romance, but I have to say that even the rather outlandish plot, the hideous fashion that the Featheringtons favour, and the slightly over-dramatic nature of the entire thing hasn't put me off or dulled my enjoyment of this series. It is entertaining, and an escape from the dull, rather bleak reality we're all living through at the moment, and so in that way, it provides the perfect kind of escapism, something completely unlike real life, where true love wins, despite all of the troubles along the way, and the bad guys have their downfall (I'm thinking particularly of Daphne's first suitor/proposal. She throws a particularly good punch, so well done Daphne!). Gossip Girl set in a historical (though fairly inaccurate) setting, and thoroughly enjoyable",10
North America,I really love most of the changes they did from the what was on the book. Love the cast they did wonderful! They truly played their characters well! I had fun watching this series and do recommend to watch it!,10
North America,"Julia Quinn created a dream worthy, charming Duke in the book. The chemistry between Daphne and the Duke should be palpable! He is supposed to be dashing with blue eyes. I can't buy into this, there just isn't anything brooding about him. Zero chemistry, ZERO. Not off to a good start with this one...",7
North America,"Is a great story, really well made and enjoyable to watch, I think the actors all did a great job and is really refreshing to see people of color in period stories.
And if you are mad about that last thing then stay mad and quiet thanks.",10
North America,An enjoyable watch that I was unaware was based on a series of novels.,9
North America,"Sorry but I could watch only for 10 min. The queen who behaves like a drank sailor in a pub. Where is the grace and benevolence? Really???
Editing my first review: after seeing a high score ratings, tried to whatch one more time, picked episode 3. No!! It is impossible. I have very sophisticated taste in movies and degree in art history.
This movie is nothing but a disappointment",1
North America,Terrible casting and even worse acting. The whole thing does a fun book series a disservice. I am disappointed.,1
North America,"I love the culture, costumes and cast!I enjoy the storyline and believe the show will continue to do great.Check your racism at the door! Stop trying to make everything black and white - judge the show on the acting and true storyline.",10
North America,"First off, I couldn't care less about the diverse cast. The actors who played Simon and Lady Danbury were great. But the personalities for Anthony, Violet, and so many others were just...wrong. I wasn't a fan of the addition of Mr Featherington, or the boxing they included.
And why has no one mentioned the absurdity of the royalty plot?? Why was that needed? Ruined the whole thing for me.
The fleshing out of the other siblings was nice, but it also left a lot of blank spots in Daphne's development.",3
North America,"As long as you realize that it's fine. I thought it would be more witty, more sparkling like the new Emma movie which was quite quirky. I kept expecting it to have more of a contemporary spin. But its predictable tosh! And heroine looks insipid, not sure why she called an incomparable when she is so timid!Nice sets, lovely dresses shame about the plot...",7
North America,"Things I liked- costumes, sets, mama bridgerton, Eloise, the Duke is hot, Marina change up and seeing Sir Philip early, musicThings I didn't like- Papa Feathertons arc and the queens arc...both didn't add much to the story. And revealing the identity of Whistledown too early.....it should of been cut considering the series was renewed before it even premiered.Something interesting- you see the bee throughout the series but no mention of its significance...",9
North America,Everything from the cast to the costumes to the plot was just wonderful! Things are always bound to change in adaptations and in this case for the better. Casting for Simon and Lady Danbury in particular were marvelous choices! I am so very glad this show has been created and look forward to seeing many more seasons to come that will depict all the other Bridgerton books!!,10
North America,Wonderful and really keeps you on your toes. for real a very good watch to curl up on the couch.,9
North America,"Fluffy, pretty, captivating! Well written and well acted! People who fuss about historical inaccuracies obviously either haven't read the books or haven't read history. Quinn takes as much liberty with history as Shonda takes with Quinn's source material. Both are fun and entertaining. If you want historical accuracy, read Hilary Mantel (also a great read/show, but much much more grim. As is history)",9
North America,I'm okay with watching this film just for the fun but Jane Austen is an artist and her usage of words and ability illustrate people and their world they live in is comparable to a skilled painter and his brush strokes.,6
North America,"Like a huge fan of the books I have to say that I'm delighted with the show. It's absolutely charming, modern, beautiful... So happy with the result, so happy about de whole crew, actors, actresses, directors and specially shondaland team! Thank you all for this show.",10
North America,"Delightful n Delicious - binge watch if at all possible - plan to watch it again n again - should come with a warning label - the Duke is HOT, has a great behind, wonderful eyes n expressive face n body - yep, defgonna watch n rewatch - n probably a few scenes rewind n repeat. Great period details. Loved the blended cast. Great series that should have wonderful future seasons!",10
North America,"I absolutely love this adaptation. I've read the books and Shonda has brought the characters to brilliant life. The music, costumes and sets are breathtaking. I can't stop watching. Can not wait for Season 2!",10
North America,"I have read all of the books and the movie was beyond my wildest expectations! Loved the actors, costumes, storyline, etc... I can't wait for the next season!",10
North America,"This show really captured the FUN of Julia Quinn's work. While I did find the diversity of the cast to be a bit blatant, the story moves right along as of their skin color didn't matter. I REALLY liked the portrayal of Simon once I knew the writers weren't adding in some background of African roots. Just the actor's skin color; no big deal.
Costuming and sets are gorgeous. It's a bit fantastical rather than perfectly historical, but it balances nicely between the two in a nearly believable, but still fun, way.",9
North America,"A refreshing take on historical drama. The humour is inspired, the costumes are divine and the cast all played their parts perfectly. I was hooked from beginning to end. Definitely recommend.",10
North America,Simply wonderful. Well acted and delightful in its visual design.,10
North America,"This show is very wrong and i am not talkin about the diversity the show honestly that is the only part that is respectable!! i am talking about the language, the dresses( shape and colour). on top of that it has mediocare writing at best. this could have been done more gracefully ofcourse. the idea was fine while making it reality something went horribly wrong. And please do not just say a show is good because it is diverse it is very important being diverse yes try to look past the big corprations maniplations and see and hear everything not just like a show because it is a bit different when it is empty an 2 dimensional.",1
North America,"I loved this show! People need to understand that it is not a history lesson, it's fun and romantic, as it should be. And I loved they took the opportunity to showcase amazing POC talent playing parts that had not been usually portrayed by them.
Shonda is a genius.",10
North America,Loved the series! Better than the books! The characters are faithful to the spirit and I loved every moment.I hope Netflix does right by Shondaland and keeps this running for all the books!,10
North America,"Better than my expectation, i have to admit. the story flow quite good enough whilst the casts are not the superior good looking but lovely & adoring. cant wait to watch the season 2",10
North America,The acting style is painful to watch. Costume and set choices are tacky. I cringed through the first episode hoping it would get better. It didn't. If you are looking for an imaginative/funny period piece watch The Great instead.,1
North America,I read all the series of The Bridgerton and it is icredible how i could see the characters in the actors. I really loved everything,10
North America,"Nothing redeeming about this show, why even call it Bridgerton when it completely butchers the story beyond recognition",1
North America,"Not 100 percent true to quinns novels but books to screen never are, something I prepared myself before watching.A wonderful series even if hadnt read the books before would have still enjoyed. Love the twist with morden music in classic form, the sets and costumes are exquisite.
The cast are amazing and well casted.As for those saying its not historically correct, its not meant to be, hate to tell you this but this isn't real!!! This isn't based on real life, it isn't a true story, and never once claimed to be.
Dont let your racism show and enjoy the show and the actors for their amazing work and not judge the colour of someones skin ( your only embarrassing yourself)Only Wish the characters especially the bridgerton family members were more like their orginal novel selves. There is a reason Quinn fans love the bridgerton family so much writers please don't change that.Can not wait for series 2!!!",10
North America,"I must admit I don't catch everything because they talk so fast in their British accents but I'm enjoying it so far! The costumes are lovely and while some of the acting is a bit campy, I still enjoy it all. It's a spectacle to be hold for sure!",8
North America,"First off, question for those complaining about historical accuracy over a purely fictional story: black aristocrats are an inaccuracy, but string quartet covers of Ariana Grande and Taylor are historically spot on? Give us a break from your racism and pettiness.As for the show, I find myself not liking Shonda's work more often than not, but I've managed to willingly sit through this one because it is a time period I'm most interested in (Pride & Prejudice is one of my all-time favorite movies). I appreciate the elements that give the show a slightly modern twist for a period that is usually portrayed as completely modest and proper. The setting is visually beautiful and it's refreshing to see a diverse and eclectic cast (reminds me of Brandy's Cinderella). The plot is standard yet I enjoy these little matchmaking/suitor storylines, and I'm interested in seeing more of the show.",7
North America,"Even though I am an enormous Regency fan I had never heard of these books, let alone read them. I'll admit that the first episode was a bit disconcerting since I didn't know anything about the show before seeing a short trailer, but I soon realized the genius of the casting. The actors are well chosen and play their characters with believability - isn't that all we really need? I laughed, I cried, I fell in love with Daphne and Simon. And especially with Lady Danbury. I'm going to see if I can download the rest of the books and I'll probably be up late tonight, reading more about my new favorite people and seeing them all in my mind's eye. I cannot wait for season 2!",8
North America,What happened to this series ?? Tell me Julia why did you sell your story? Why did you allow Shonda to change it that way? I am very disappointed !!!,1
North America,Really enjoyed it watched the whole season in one setting Hope there's a season two??,10
North America,"This wonderful and romantic book series has been beautifully brought to life in the Bridgerton series! As someone who has read the books over and over again, the introduction to the Bridgerton family was so cleverly done. They took the over lapping timelines from the various books into the series and set into motion each characters personalities and laid the groundwork for their eventual love story. Daphne and Simon were played so well, whether they were flirting, fighting or tearing each other's clothes off. I laughed, cried and swooned as I binged all 8 hours in a row. I can't wait to watch it again and this was such a wonderful Christmas present (and a 2020 highlight.)",10
North America,"I can't wait for more I'm obsesses, i know it is probably not for all people who read the book just give it a try it won't hurt",10
North America,"A lovely indulgence show. Enjoyed every moment. Every single one of the actors was so attractive, I literally could not tear my eyes away from the screen.",10
North America,This show is amazing! If you've read the books then you understand the importance of this show. Absolutely wonderful!! I'm so thrilled with all the episodes.,10
North America,"As many people have mentioned previously, this series is an adaption of Julia Quinn's steamy romance series. As a long time fan of her work, I was not amused by the direction this series went in. I have read the entire series multiple times. The books were lighthearted, funny, and rarely accurate to the historical time period themselves. As such, the historical inaccuracies in the Netflix show amused me rather than irritating me. The partially black cast may not have fit with the time period, but then again neither did Quinn's original characterizations, most of whom treated women with the respect they rarely had back then. This is a work of fiction, as reinforced by the random snippets of Taylor swift and Ariana grande. The thing that did irritate me was the direction they went with many of the characters I loved in the books. Everyone that provided comedic relief in the books suddenly became mean, awful, or unnecessarily dramatic. All of the comedy was replaced with drama. Simon and Daphne were the only characters in this season somewhat accurate to their characters in the books. Due to the changes, I'm not sure if season 2 will be able to redeem some of the characters enough for me to like them again.Summary: Do not watch expecting a historical accuracy or Quinn's or lighthearted comedy. STEAMY: Do not watch with anyone you wouldn't watch GOT with. Watch with the reminder that this is from the same person that gave us Grey's anatomy. Overall, decent way to kill time in 2020",7
North America,"A sumptuous and romantic adaptation of the first book in one of the best regency romance series of all time. The cast are beautiful and engaging and the story top notch with a swoon worthy happily ever after for the ages! Can I get season two now, please?",10
North America,Pure escapism. I've read the books so was looking forward to this. Virtually stunning.,9
North America,"This show is the absolute definition of a perfect show in my opinion, it has everything you need and are looking for in a tv show, it has the drama, the romance, the tension, the anger, the humour, and much more, i believe as well that any person of any age would enjoy this show as much as i have.
Yours sincerely,
Lady whistledown.",10
North America,"I hadn't heard of the books but added this to my list when I saw it was produced by Shonda. Julie Andrews as the narrator, beautiful sets, clothes and photography plus modern songs by string quartets. Why can't people take shows for what they are - absolutely exquisite escapism?! Loved every second of this!",9
North America,"I've not read the books so don't know how faithful it is but this series was great fun. It was over the top and very dramatic but also very funny. Which is exactly what you want from a Regency era comic-drama.It's exactly the sort of thing to take your mind off real life drama. It is definitely a good idea to spend 8 hours watching people dancing in beautiful clothes atextravagant balls, and wondering if the pretty young woman will marry the handsome Duke. (Instead of worrying about a pandemic) I definitely recommend.But to those complaining about ""forced diversity"" and ""wokeness"" of the series: get a grip.If this were a biopic or a retelling of a real moment in history then I would be as picky as anyone else about historical accuracy (although I do think some real life figures whose skin colour is not particularly important to their story, so it doesn't always matter). But this is a fictional programme. I assume all the people complaining that there shouldn't be black people playing aristocrats are also annoyed at the use of modern pop songs and modern phrases? No? Right, well it's just racism then.Do not try to disguise your racism by pretending that you care about historical accuracy when really you just don't like that you're seeing black people on the telly.Well the cast are all excellent and are in those roles because they are brilliant. And they're not going anywhere. So get used to it.And just watch it because it's wonderful, good fun!",8
North America,"This is a Pride and Prejudice style romp around regency London in the style of Gossip Girl or The OC, with a hint of Wes Anderson and a smattering of Baz Luhrman.Perfectly watchable and entertaining, fairly fast paced, colourful, and fun. It is not high art or history, but not is it meant to be. Things like the colour-blind casting, to me, added to the energy, and - hell - why not!If you want an accurate costume drama this is possibly not for you, but give it a whirl. If you want a bit of fancy-dress fun and intrigue, have a crack.",7
North America,"The casting is the best thing I have seen in a while!!!
I absolutely LOVED the books and they smashed it!!!
As far as I'm concerned the best book adaptations I have ever seen!",10
North America,"I adore this show so much! The casting is brilliant and although it is of course not exactly as the book, the stories they added work perfectly I think. Can't wait for the next season!",10
North America,"An absolutely wonderful show. brilliant cast, gorgeous visuals, amazing soundtrack! very compelling",10
North America,"If you like history with romance, action and great actors you are at the good place ! Loved the books love even more the série even though some things don't totally match but that's normal as it is an adaptation and a great one !
I watched all the episodes over a night ! So addictive and well played",9
North America,"I have read all the bridgerton books and I must say I am happy with the results of the adaption. Some areas has been modified to reflect modern subjects which gives the series more point and at times relatable feeling. Janes Austin styles with a few more saucy moments, enjoyed it so much, watch it all in one day! Would recommend to anyone",9
North America,"I don't care what color the actors are or even about the inclusion of modern music, but I do care how the characters are completely butchered compared to the books. I'm a huge Quinn fan and this series, although welcome in theory, fails to capture the subtleties of each character and the humor of the narration. I want more period pieces on Netflix, yes, but please don't call this one Bridgerton.
I wish I hadn't read the books, perhaps I'd have enjoyed it more.",4
North America,"I love it!!, and how the roles of expectations in society are reversed. Very good and worth watching",10
North America,"I feel like people giving this bad reviews are just sort of freaked out by the casting of black and brown actors as historically caucasian figures. I mean, it was strange at first for me, mainly because I don't expect non-white people to speak in that posh, upperclass way and behave so rigidly as they do in these period dramas. But about halfway through the second episode I found the ""alternative"" casting made the whole thing more interesting to me. The non-white characters just grabbed my attention whenever they were on screen, partially because they're excellent actors and fun to watch (and Regé-Jean Page as the Duke - lordy, MEOW) and I think I also felt the sort of run-of-the-mill plot was elevated somewhat with this added visual element.But to criticise the acting as some did here is ludicrous. The acting is superb, as are the characterisations. The whole thing is a bit unreal, the candy-bright costumes especially give it a sort of fantasy feel. The plot is a bit one-note and simplistic, and I admit I'm not super enthralled with a drama focusing on whether or not certain people will get married, but it was charming, mostly due to the wonderful cast and buoyant direction.As people of that time might say, it's a ""most pleasant diversion"".",8
North America,"Beautiful actors, gorgeous imagery... and can we talk about the costumes? Such attention to detail was paid in all areas.
Truly enjoyable to watch--every second of it.",10
North America,"Honestly,i don't know what i expected before actually seeing Bridgerton, but it exceeded my expectations on so many levels. I am a big fan of JQ's novels, and never have i ever before seen a world from a paper so beautifully transferred to screen. All the emotions, the casting choices, the chemistry, the humor, while keeping the soul the novel has, i am speechless and still recovering from everything i felt when watching it. This is honestly the first adaptation where i can't say i wish they'd done something differently.
If you are looking for a historically accurate story, then move along from this one. How one can pay attention to skin color next to every beautiful detail this story is interwoven with, is beside me.
Will definitely be watching many times again as i am not ready to leave this world quite yet(not sure I'll ever be).
Thank you Shonda Rhimes and Chris Van Dusen for this work of art.",10
North America,The casting was perfect. Simon *wink* is dreamy... it is a must watch (and read),10
North America,"Those complaining of woke historical ""inaccuracies"" should also point out that the characters should all have rotten teeth and small pox scars all over their faces- but that is ok for them???",8
North America,"This is a great show - funny, silly, basically Gossip Girl in the 1800s! It's mainly based on the first book but dips in and out of the others and adds a few new characters.If anyone is complaining about the diversity of the cast and it being 'inconsistent' with the period, then their racism is fully showing. The show makes use of modern songs, amongst other things inconsistent with the time period, yet no one cares about that...I can only assume this is because they don't actually care about accuracy and just want an excuse to vent their racism. I suggest they take a long, hard look at themselves and why it bothers them so much.",8
North America,"I binged it one sitting. I loved how the characters interacted with each other, I loved the costumes, and I thought Daphne and her Simon had a great on screen chemistry.",9
North America,"Finally we have a historical romance series which doesn't shy away from showing steamy and passionate scenes. This adaptation of Julia Quinn's acclaimed Bridgerton books is so much more than I had hoped it would be. The colours, the costumes, the music, the set design is vibrant and fairy tale like. This has drama, romance, gossip and well written characters that a romance lover will surely enjoy. Can't wait for S2.",9
North America,"(In short... Book lovers should go in with an open-mind and Jane Austen lovers go in not expecting an historically accurate regency romance, but a fun modern twist!)If you're expecting this show to be a BBC Pride and Prejudice or Emma series, you will be sorely disappointed.
Bridgerton mixes modern society with a Regency backdrop. With it's diverse cast and orchestra versions of modern music, it has a very fresh and modern feel while still having most of what you love about a good Regency romance.
Being an avid reader of Julia Quinn's novels, I tried to watch this with an open mind, knowing book-to-tv adaptations will not be 100% true to their original stories. Though I thought the narration and overly-posh character's of the first episode of Bridgerton to be a bit over-the-top, the show does settle into a nice rhythm come episode two and onward.
The showrunners and writers really do capture what was and is so special about the Bridgerton novels' stories and characters while bringing in bits of other Bridgerton books and new characters and side-stories to fill out the show.
I really enjoyed this series and seeing the characters and I know and love being brought to the small screen. Very entertaining, sexy and fast paced all with beautifully designed costumes and sets. I binged all 8 episodes on Christmas day and I am ready to watch it again! I for one can't wait until season 2!",9
North America,"Pretty good representation of book series, so far. Dumb to cast a Gregory to be younger than Hyacinth! I hope there are more episodes soon. ??",9
North America,"Thoroughly enjoyed this adaptation of the books. The sets, locations and costumes were visually stunning. The actors embodied the characters we have come to love, and I loved the diversity of the cast. It should be noted that there were many POC in the Regency period, and Queen Charlotte was actually a person of mixed ethnicity. There was also a black Duke who was a member of the European aristocracy. There were also many marriages of mixed ethnicity. It's a pity that history doesn't do more to highlight POC instead of surpressing these details, leading many uninformed of historical accuracy.",10
North America,"Ok, I was shocked at the beginning, I must confess. It was like why, why? I love period dramas, and the inclusion of people of color in those roles was not realistic and made me think of a bad joke. But I decided to give it a go, nothing better to do today. And oh my god. Once you have watched 20 mins, you are just captivated by it. I bing watched it. And rewatched again cause it is a beautiful story, music is great, to die for outfits. And the acting cast just wonderful actors, also beautiful. What a great show. Vibrant, colorful, exceptional.",10
North America,This program has so much cheese they should have called it Wisconsin.,1
North America,"After accepting the black aristocracy and that show even doesn't try to reflect the reality of 19th century I think this series was really fun and entertaining, story flow was really good. Not to mention the beautiful set and a dressing. Eight episodes went through in a jiffy leaving you to want more. Yes, I will definitely wait for season 2 to come!",9
North America,I'm too thrilled by the show to make criticisms. I loved the casting. Loved the sets and costumes. Loved that they kept to the essence and spirit of the books. Loved that each episode felt long enough. Loved Pen and Eloise. Love. Love. Love.The only thing I would have liked to see more was more LOL wit that Julia Quinn is so good at.I want more seasons. I want ALL the seasons.,10
North America,"I LOVED THIS SERIES SO MUCH AND AS A READER OF THE BOOKS, I CAN SAY IT IS AMAZING. Of course, as an adaptation there were scenes that I would like to be in the series, however everything is perfect that I didn't care. I highly recommend this series to everyone, remembering that there are hot scenes there are scenes that make you cry. And despite being a period series, the modernity inserted in it, current songs played in a classical version, everything is perfect. I highly recommend the series to everyone, remembering that there are hot scenes, and there are also scenes that make you cry.",10
North America,"Pure unadulterated enjoyment!! A wonderful, theatrical, dramatic, romantic Production. Wonderful costumes, delicious relationships and characters. I can't wait to watch more! Thank you to cast and crew for giving us this in 2020!",9
North America,Didn't know this was based on a book but gosh I binged the show and I LOVE it so much!I don't know why people are bashing on the acting but it's top notch just like everything else about it,10
North America,"I never read the books, but I am loving this series. The diversity is fantastic and refreshing.",10
North America,"It's like a bad played parody, not enjoyed, not recommend.",3
North America,"1800's Gossip Girl with infusions of modern day references. I'm enjoying this series very much! (On episode 4)Also, to the one reviewer that was upset that black men and women are in this show as dukes, queens, princes, etc. you are the prime example of subconscious racism. Very disappointing.",8
North America,"The show slaps if you're looking for escapism (who isn't) and if you stick with it, by episode 3 you'll be invested. @ everyone who's mad about good diversity and representation can shut up and go watch game of thrones ????
Also the costuming and makeup isn't that bad historically speaking and I haven't seen brastraps once (for this I give it 5 more stars)",10
North America,Loved every second of it. Stays surprisingly accurate to the books. I was at first wary of the acting choice for Simon but I have to say he was perfect! The show also did a good job of incorporating narratives from the other books to prepare for the next seasons.,8
North America,"I usually dont like the adaptations of books, this one though is an exeption. I loved that the first season set up information for the other characters, evwn more that the first book did. Specially loved the George-Marina-Philip subplot.",10
North America,"I've been a fan of JQ's earlier work and the first 4 books of the Bridgerton series. I can not remember how many times I've read this series and know their stories by heart. I admit that I was one of the fans who were skeptical with the cast not being faithful to the book when I first got wind of the casting choices. I mean, where's Simon's piercing blue eyes? Why are the Bridgerton men's heights wrong or Daphne's hair colour is different than the rest. But whilst I was watching this, I forgot all those and embraced the characters with arms wide open. This is a work of fiction and people can do well by treating it as such. It is lavish, it is fun. There's drama and intrigue. Yes, they have changed the story a bit to fit a TV series but I have learned long before that books and movies are going to be different. I am giving it a 9 just because I'm still undecided if I like how they depicted one of my favourite characters. I can't wait for Anthony and Kate's story as that is my favourite book in the series! Bee it is!",9
North America,"I was going to give this a chance until a heard a string quartet version of Ariana Grande's ""Thank You, Next"" It was then that I realized this is just some silly, cheap series targeted to younger viewers. No thank you, next?",1
North America,"A true fan of Julia Quinn and The Duke & I was my first book read in her Bridgeton series and thoroughly enjoyed seeing the story come to live before my very eyes in Shonda/Netflix's version of this beloved Romance story! Loved everything about Netflix The Duke & I as the struggles were real for the mothers of girls as we had seen in P&P w/ Mrs. Bennett and making advantageous matches for their securities in a ""Man's World"" - The Duke & I delivered a stunning performance by a stellar cast of professional actors ... Lady Danbury & Lady Whistledown are two forces to be reckoned with ... The Duke & I deliver on a story worthy of Julia Quinn's imagination with pure visual delights ... Exquisite Costumes, Stunning Cinematography, breathtaking Choreography, and a well written adaptation of JQs novel of the same name. Thank you, Shonda Rhimes & Netflix, for allowing me to glimpse what the world of Regency period may have looked like with all the delights and naughty bits - I loved seeing Simon's back story and watching him realize through the eyes of love from his wife (Daphne) that he was a man of true worth - Simon never stood a chance from the moment Daphne bumped into (literally) at a ball - looking forward to seeing more of Daphne & Simon and the Bridgerton's ""Pall Mall"" game!",10
North America,This series is amazing!! My expectations were high but they surprised me even more!! The actors showed us in a perfect way how the characters felt and everything was similar to the books! Regé was the best Simon I could've imagine!! Simply perfect!,10
North America,"Put me to sleep in first 15minsSeriously what where the thinking , the cast to writing to acting everythings seems misplaced",3
North America,"I loved!
It's perfect. I love the book and LOVED this series.
I need a new season.",10
North America,I loved how they managed to get the essence of the characters from the books to the screen. I loved the scenery and the clothes as well as all the excitement as everything is presented. I loved it so much and I'm looking forward to the 2nd season.,10
North America,"I was so excited to the series and I really loved the outcome, I just can't be more happy, the actors was a perfect, I just can't describe in word my happiness",9
North America,"Talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show-stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique.",10
North America,"Of what being in royal company would be like this may be your cup of tea. The Brits are still a nation ruled by royals so don't let their stuck up insidious accents fool you, they are dumb as ever.",1
North America,"If you read the books, and want everything the same, i'm sorry but even the best movies can be like the books of they are based for.
So, with that in mind you need to watch this series, really, it's a piece of an art from Shonda and Chris, it's complety difference of everything we saw until now about them. And they were so faithful with our fellings about the this incredible family and characters, since Simon is describe like a different man, so i think the actor was awesome, the actress who plays Daph is marvelous! Both are! All the crew are. And since i'm historian i can assure you guys, the black people was , and is of course, but at the time was a very important part of society, since Queen Charlotte is describe as an almost black woman! Then, i think that's not a problem, and the actors are amazing, the serie is amazing, is almost like as the book, but we can meet better the characters of the next books, witch is good for a show, let's be open mind guys! Let's enjoy this beautiful series! Let's support the show and everyone, Julia Quinn too, she is so happy, so i really believe they maked a incredible show, and i hope we have more seasons!",10
North America,"O QUE FALAR DE BRIDGERTON...
FICOU PERFEITOOOO
AMEI TUDO DO INICIO AO FIM, CADA LAGRIMA DERREAMADA FOI A CERTEZA QUE BRIDGERTON VAI SEMPRE FICAR GUARDADO NO CORAÇÃO.
O REGÉ É A PHOEBE DERAM UM SHOW DE ATUAÇÃO ASSIM COMO O ELENCO INTEIRO. ???????????????????? ??????????????",10
North America,"Bridgerton is full of surprises! with a lot of romance, comic relief, powerful speeches and striking scenes, we have a series with a plot and captivating actors! it certainly differs from books, but nothing that a good fan cannot love! it is incredible to be able to see the whole ""history"" of the most fertile family in society coming to life!",10
North America,"The plot of the tv show is amazing, is a typical shondaland show!",10
North America,Fiquei impressionada com a produção dessa série. Já era apaixonada pelos livros e a série superou todas as minhas expectativas!,10
North America,"Not great, but very good. I binged all episodes on Xmas day. I will watch this series again. Please give me more adaptions of romance/romantic science fiction please. The well to choose from is very deep.",8
North America,"I expected people to be very upset about the diverse casting, and so many reviews comment on that rather than the actual show. Full disclosure I would've given this 8 stars but added one to balance out the exaggerated one-star reviews.I'm a huge Downton fan so I leaped at the chance to check out this show. I also liked Sanditon which was lighter and more saccharine.I binged the entire season of Bridgerton in one night, and am totally not sorry. My standard is whether I enjoyed the show and felt it worthy of the time spent watching. Yes, and Yes!I love period pieces, but also know Shonda Rhimes takes no prisoners where drama is concerned. I was not disappointed!Of course some of the plot is thin and characters fun but predictable archetypes. But that's also every Jane Austen novel! There are few revelations that can't be predicted based on similar shows and tropes. The Featherton family = a twist on Cinderella with evil stepmother and ugly stepsisters. Daphne and Simon = Beauty and the Beast etcBut boy did I love watching every episode. Lot's of imho over-the-top ""love"" scenes meant to be salacious and graphic but sometimes made me giggle due to the exaggeration.I loved all the bright and often garish costuming which was as much a part the characters as anything else. Lots of candy colors, rich blues, purples and pops of red. It was a visual feast!I thoroughly enjoyed this very fun and escapist show, and found it refreshing to see black people in period garb just living like everyone else and NOT discussing race. I didn't know I needed this show, but turns out I need more like this!Get your girlfriends together and watch!",9
North America,I love this!! A true romance novel come to life...it has EVERYTHING.,10
North America,"My god...I adore everything about this...Literally everything. And I've only seen 2 episodes. But...I know, because it's Shonda...that this will not only, never disappoint, but I'll be desperate for more...",10
North America,"I liked the cast, but the drama is hard to understand. Why the creators brought Queen Charlotte to the scene? Why Marina and all the fuss with the opera singer?
It was confusing, it made the plot slow and heavy.
Simon is so freaking HOT, but not even him could save this disaster.
Eloise was so annoying, and the costumes... This is a nonsense.
A terrible waste of time. I hope they do a better job for the second season. Julia Quinn and her characters deserve better.
And the music... horrible attempt.",1
North America,"I loved it. I've read the whole series and i can understand why they made more plots: one book doesn't have material to 8 episodes.
And its ok!
I loved everything, the costumes, the music, the chemistry between the Duke and Daphne!
Loved the relationship between Eloise and Benedict (which was another surprise! Lovely actor!)
Loved the Featherington plot line, and the Marina thing, cause I didn't feel a attachment for her in the books, and now i can!
Love the Queen and Lady Danburry specially her been Simon's tutor.About Anthony... he is lost, and the whole Siena thing makes so much better for the start of the plot for the next season, and how he loving Kate will be unexpected!For me, it was perfect!",10
North America,"I enjoyed every moment of this lovely series. It is pure escapism. It is beautifully casted, sexy and fun. I hope there will be more of it in the future. It is wonderful to see beautiful actors of color given the oppurtunity to show their stuff in a period piece like this. I loved it.",10
North America,I'm giving this a higher rating than I should not because of the storylines (predictable) but because of the lead actor as Simon. I'm a 56 year old white woman and all I can say is yum-my!,8
North America,"I do not know the books and came with expectations. I do love a good period piece, so seeing a diverse cast was odd to me at first. It did raise eyebrows for me. But then, from the get go, you clearly see that this isn't meant to be historical: contemporary twist on classical music, unrealistic plot etc... and surprisingly it worked for me! I got mesmerised by it and couldn't stop watching. The characters are charming: Simon's super hot, Daphne very cute, the Queen! Hell that really spelt it: hey! This is fantasy and meant to be fun. It's really really worked for me. It's colourful and wonderful. For once actors of colour are not confined to playing servants and it's a good change. It's fun, it's positive, it's well played, it's imaginative, just give it a go.",10
North America,"I love the series. Is it an exact retelling of the books, of course not. Books are never translated perfectly to screen, but this takes a beloved series and gives it enough of a twist to watch it as an entirely new product. It's modern with its pop tunes turned into classical pieces and colorblind casting, but it also gives us a glimpse at the harsh reality women faced, in both high society and otherwise. The dialogue between characters shares some of that even more than the books did. Regency romances tend to glamorize the past, and the shows reminds us that while things are visually beautiful, the reality often was not.",10
North America,"I'm a huge history buff as well as a lover of all things English. The first episode caught me off guard and I wasn't sure if I could wrap my head around the concept (I'm not familiar with the books) and casting. But as the series went on, I actually fell in love with the pure fantasy/uniqueness of it. The chemistry and smoldering attraction between Daphne and Simon was almost as good as Claire and Jamie (if you know, you know)! Anyway, is it historically factual? Absolutely not. But sometimes it's good to let go and enjoy a fun period piece with no expectations.",10
North America,"Bridgerton is a delight.
I hope they make many more seasons. The sets and costumes are amazing. The actors are great. I love Shonda Rhimes production of Julia Quinn's book.",10
North America,"Escapism at its finest. Gorgeous costumes, stunning sets, beautiful people. There's a ton of build up and heat and humor and passion, everything I want in the romance genre.It's a tv series based on a romance novel, not a historical documentary. It doesn't matter if it's not 100% historically accurate, that's not the point.The point is love, and Bridgerton delivers!",10
North America,"Remember when we used to like watching soap operas and sweeping romantic mini series? Thank you Bridgerton for bringing back the addictive romance and fun. People whining about diversity and historical accuracy are completely missing the point. The show doesn't claim to be something it's not. Shondaland knoes exactly what it's doing and they are filling a huge hole that hasn't been filled for decades. Sometimes we just want to be entertained.I'm a huge fan on the Bridgerton series. For years I've wanted a film adaptation but a series is even better. The books are obviously better but they've done a great job of capturing Julia Quinn's wit, charm and romance. It's not a perfect show but it's perfect if you're looking for some feel-good escapism. Daphne and Simon's love story isn't the best of the series so it's only going to get better from here. Can't wait for the other siblings to get their stories.",10
North America,"I'm loving the series so far! It'a supposed to be like gossip girl set in the regency era, and it's not supposed to be serious! Have fun, get lost in the fun. I read the books in my twenties and they were all silly and frothy. I mean how many dukes and duchesses and royalty were there for the characters to fall in love with?
My only problem... is that I wish Daphne was more like the character I imagined in the book. But still great show! And man the actor playing Simon is so handsome! This is a must watch!",9
North America,As an avid reader I read this series through the years as they were published. It was a favorite. A screen play will never be exactly the same as the book from which it was made. With that in mind I was able to fully enjoy the series as its own and I was not disappointed. Thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining and I'm hoping for a second season.,9
North America,"The best show in 2020!
The actors are so good in ther jobs that I feel I was living with them!",10
North America,"I loved every minute of this. I've never read the books, I had no expectations whatsoever, and I couldn't care less if it isn't historically correct. It's Jane Austen meets Gossip Girl. It's romance, drama, and schemes. If you want a documentary, go watch something else. This is great entertainment, just as it was supposed to be. Merry Christmas!",10
North America,I loved it so much! The characters are so amazing and talent! The story is very good and the appearance looks stunning. One of the most good series of the year and I can not wait for the next,10
North America,I loved the series. The representation was fantastic and very important to construct a better world.,10
North America,"This show was everything we've been missing on tv lately! Yes it has a diverse cast...get over it, I was amazed how beautiful the cast was and it being diverse only made the show better in my eyes. I haven't read the books so I can't talk about how true to the story it is, but I loved this story. I binged it in one day, I couldn't stop watching. I loved all the little nuances, the backdrop, the actors were amazing. I say you go watch this show and enjoy how the world should have looked from the very beginning",10
North America,"The serie is not like the book, but I attempted to say it's even better.
The adaptation is there, with some differences from the book, but all the vibe, romance, drama and even funny parts are all over the place in so many beautiful ways to explore it.
As a fan of the books, I felt excitement, sadness, joyful and the most important in a romantic piece of art: I fell in love with everything. The music is spectacular! The cast choice is just perfect.Loved it so much.
Cant wait for the next season to watch Antony's story on screen.",10
North America,"Very disappointed. bad acting and the actors are totally devoid of presence and charm. therefore, there is no chemistry, there is no passion, there is no beauty. everything very badly done, it seems that I am watching an open TV show for teenagers. ridiculous",1
North America,"This is an amazing show! Just watched episode one and went right into episode two. This is a unique storyline with some historical context to it, abs incredibly well done. The costumes are so artistic and the townships are in the most perfect settings.
I am watching this until there is no more!",10
North America,"If Shonda Rhimes, Chris Van Dusen, or whoever was responsible this series wanted to write a fictional regency love story that covered race, class and any other issue that plagues us in 2020, then they should have made up something of their own. Instead they took a wonderful series with such lovely characters and storylines and ruined it. I'm on episode 5 and I recognize NO ONE and NOTHING from the novels. It's breaking my heart. Honestly, the storylines, characters and actors are just awful and I'm struggling to watch this mess. I loved the novels and I truly hate this series. I don't know if I can even finish. Just plain awful.
DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!",1
North America,"Bridgerton is just perfect. There is great representation in the cast, the wonderful story, impeccable soundtrack. I only have praise for this wonderful work.",10
North America,The cast is perfect!!! We can see representativeness and diversity and this is amazing!!!COLORFUL BRIDGERTON,10
North America,"I absolutely loved! The new characters fit perfectly into the plot, and the iconic scenes from the book are all present.",10
North America,I loved so much this show. The picture is perfect. The cast is fabulous and so talented. I took a star because that specific polemic scene between Daphne and the duke. It was unnecessary and totally wrong. It was romanticized and we know it.,9
North America,Super fun and exciting show with intrigue. The characters are all well done and I love the brightness and colours in the show. The broad and diverse cast is amazing. Would love some lgbt characters though!!,10
North America,"I loved the cast, the details are excellent, I loved the diversity in the choice of actors, an incredible soundtrack",10
North America,"I simply LOVED it, from loyalty to books to choosing characters. I think the thing I liked the most was the choice of the actors, I loved the representation they had with the main black character, the black queen etc.Even though racism at the time was indescribable, they changed that, and that was the best. I loved the sets, and I loved them, I just LOVED the costumes that look like they came out of a fairy tale (and were very expensive). One of the things I didn't like was how Daphne handled Simon's situation, and the loyalty to some characters, but other than that it was perfect.",9
North America,"I was very excited to watch the series. The cast is amazing, I love all the actors. I think they could have eliminated a certain scene, but the rest of the series, I found it exciting. The main character, Daphne, had everything to be one of the best sisters, but ...",10
North America,"As a lover of the books I was so ready to see the family I have fallen in love with come to life. Is it exactly like the books no BUT as an avid reader that has watched many adaptations this did not disappoint!!! While there are variations from the book they are great ones! I follow the author on social media so I knew going in she loved it so I went into it with an open mind. I can't get over how much I loved it!!! The colors are beautiful, actors are not exactly as I picture them but as I continued to watch I felt they fit better than I had imagined. I was also worried how they would handle putting 8 books into a series because I know it will more than likely not last 8 seasons. They included bits from the other books beautifully to satisfy this reader and those new to it to keep them interested. I can't tell you enough how amazing this was!!! Thank you Ms. Quinn for allowing your books to come to life!!! I hope many people are happy too so that we may see the rest of the books come to life!",10
North America,"Love this show! So captivating and entertaining but above all else, the costumes are simply out of this world! The whole show is such a feast for the eyes.",10
North America,"I particularly found the series fantastic, I loved the diversity of the cast, and I think this is just fiction, so it's ok to change things that didn't happen at that time. After all, the story portrays a novel and not a historical fact.",10
North America,"On the surface, it has it all and so much potential.
Great period in History, High Society, Class, fantastic costumes and then it falls flat on its A**.
The story has been told over and over and over again.
Family with many daughters, Important of status, Jealousy, Macho, Honor and poor choices.
And poor choices are something that is so utterly repeated again and again that (I) find it unbelievable and boring.
Too bad .... and what a waste.",4
North America,"I thought it was entertaining and not terrible but nothing special.
It would be nice if people realised that just about nothing in this show is historically accurate (not the costumes, not the hair, not the jewellery, not the music, not the dancing, not the way people speak to each other etc. etc....maybe just the houses they live in), so to say you have a problem with the diverse cast because it's not historically accurate is just plain stupid.
I personally found the chaotic and unruly mixing of completely modern and historically inspired styles to be annoying and distracting but the diversity of the cast members had nothing to do with that, and I thought the actors were all doing a pretty good job.
Anyway, if you're looking for a (somewhat) accurate historical drama just go watch something else, there's plenty of good stuff out there.",6
North America,"Is it accurate to historical reality? No. Does that mean it's bad? Absolutely not! Finally a good costume drama, that provides jobs for both white and black actors! Usually I'm not a big fan of anything that's romantic or dramatic, but I'm 100% swooning over these series. And I really needed this, because let's be honest... this pandemic has been a real Debbie Downer to movies/series. Couldn't find anything good to watch for a while, until I found this!",10
North America,"This series is perfect, it has a lot of representation, it was very well prepared, all the people in front and behind the cameras are to be congratulated. The work exceeded all my expectations, i look forward to the next seasons !!",10
North America,"I cried so much and clapped my hands and squealed like a little child watching this! ?? We absolutely enjoyed this show. I watched it with my mom and aunt and we couldn't stop watching. We stayed up until 6am to finish it!!
I absolutely loved seeing Simon and Daphne's story unfold. Seeing their emotions and all of the drama. How fantastic! And my God, those are 2 extremely gorgeous people! ????
This show brought so much emotions out, I haven't cried and laughed so much in awhile watching a show! It was just absolutely so well done. The cast was wonderful, they all played their parts so well. This is such a unique and beautiful show. It's all about humans and connections. Family, relationships, love, fears. It is truly about US. I can't wait to rewatch it and relive all of the special and intimate moments. Life is about the connections we make and the people we love. So I will never be tired of seeing shows and films that celebrate this natural part of life. I also can't wait to see what little bits I might not have noticed the first time around!!
But aside from all of that, I have to say... Eloise stole the show for me! This girl. IS. AH. MAZE. ZING!! Just wow. Like, I have no words for this girl. She has stolen my heart. ? I would say my top, most favorite moments were involving any of these: Eloise, Peneloise, Polin, Anthony, Penelope. And, Sir Phillip!! I lived for these moments. I also adored seeing Benedict's parts, he is wonderful and cute and funny. Him and Colin interacting was great!! ???? And I loved any mention of their father, and the emotions it brought. I loved hearing any little back story from the Bridgertons, and I hope we get a TON more next season! I also totally loved seeing the bumble bee snippets. How extra! This was just so fun and so well done. If you haven't watched it, do so. There are so many ways in which people can relate to what these characters go through and deal with. It's an emotional and beautiful roller coaster.",10
North America,"Thank you for so much representation, on top of the main characters",10
North America,"Honestly, if you really enjoyed the books. Don't watch this. This was made for the Twitter bio lovers.",3
North America,"Most of the characters had potential but they're bogged down by an incredibly boring drawn out story. Certain plot points border on innovative for the historical romance genre and then step back from the edge right before they cross over into something interesting. Every character with any originality was criminally under utilized or turned into a shallow Jane Austen clone by the end. Overall, they could've cut at least 3 episodes out and several sub plots that went nowhere. Really the only truly good thing I can say about this show is that Golda Rosheuval's turn as Queen Charlotte was absolutely excellent.If you like looking at attractive people acting out tired trashy romance tropes for 8 hours, this is for you. If you want satisfying story telling, skip it.",3
North America,"There were many changes from the book. I didn't really care for the changes. There were added characters that didn't do anything for the actual plot except stretch everything out. Generally, the costuming was strange for some instances and while the Duke is perfect for the role, why was his costuming some much more avant-garde than the other male characters who wore proper ton style clothing? I understand what others are saying in regards to the diversity, but on that point, this is a fictional world that can look however the writer wants, however, I understand the reservations around that and if this wasn't an actual book first, I could suspend reality, but it's a regency romance first, which lends itself to certain expectations. All in all it's just OK for me. I'll watch this first season, but maybe not another. I'm actually kind of sad because a lot of the lighthearted fun wasn't included in the Netflix version. I just disappointed.",4
North America,The show creators did a wonderful job adapting the book for the screen. This was more than I expected for a regency romance book turned tv show. I cant wait for more!,10
North America,"It's like an adult, non-musical version of Brandy's Cinderella. Though set in the past, it's not historical. It's a lovely story with rumors and drama. A bit of ""gossip girl"" narration. It's a fun escape. The costumes and sets are picturesque.",10
North America,"It is so refreshing to see characters and not colour, follow the storyline and not reflect on history, but escape our realities for a season.Bridgerton, is a 'what if' fantasy adaptation of an era gone by where the 'Ton' set the standard for respectability, acceptability, societal mores and rules of engagement.What if Prince Harry and Megan Markel were born over 100 years before their time (and Harry was in direct line for the throne?) then Slavery in the West Indies would have ended a lot sooner and not even been considered in the American Colonies. What we would have is a society filled with rich colourful characters that should be told.After all, we are only limited by our own imagination.",10
North America,I loved this. Watched it all on Boxing Day. The characters are all really well done. The acting can be bit over the top but I think that's the point. I don't know what all of the bad reviews are about because I thought it was great.,9
North America,"Central parts of this filmed fantasy aren't far from old fact. Back in the day King George III of England married Sophia Charlotte von Mecklenburg-Streleitz; a mulatto of the Portuguese aristocratic bloodline (who in fact actually looks like one of the female characters). They had 13 brown babies which ran all through the prominent houses of that century.The scenes are slick, the intrigue compelling - the minds of man are no-doubt the same now as always. Game, as it is played on an upper-class level of privilege and prestige. A good watch.",7
North America,Bridgerton was really a welcome surprise this Christmas. It is much more than you can expect. Watch and be amazed by the most fertile family in high society.,10
North America,"I loved the original book series so much! I really couldn't get enough! When I heard Netflix was taking this on as a tv adaptation I was so excited! but after watching their version of the series it left me feeling disappointed and a little broken hearted. The MCs that the Duke and I are are based on had no chemistry which had be bored!, they made pretty much all of the characters unlikeable that you were supposed to love!, and as this is a historical romance genre, it just did not have that feel to it at all!! There's a certain charm it needs and this show just did not have it.... I don't think I'll be wasting my time on season 2. Now I have to reread the book series to rid my mind of that awful show!!",2
North America,"It is really good, i just hoped they would change the rape scene. i mean, there was no need for that scene and they made it look like daphne was a victim??????
other than that it truly is great",9
North America,"I love the show! It's a welcome change from the typical royal family, uptight conversations. It is a fictional piece and I thank the creators for having beautiful people of all races included in major rolls. Does this make the show or break the show? Absolutely not! Do the modern songs played(on strings) in this period make or break it? No! Who the hell cares.. move on. Great show!
Ignore the 1 & 2 stars that may drop this one below a 7.8.",9
North America,"I loved the series from Julia Quinn. Shonda Rhimes' reimagined characters, beautiful and realistic settings makes for an extremely entertaining series. Thank you Netflix for this Christmas present! And thanks for the diversity. Excellent acting all-around! Looking forward to Season 2.",10
North America,Its a cute entertaining mildly predictable romance. The reviews would be higher but netflix dared to cast a few black actors and internet commenters cant have that.Ignore the bad reviews. Its a solid B+ if you like romantic dramas.,10
North America,"Amazing, this serie is the best
I like this
I like history
I love everything and I agree a second seasson, for yesterday, pls",10
North America,Not sure why it has less stars on IMDb. Didn't even felt like checking reason but I was hooked to it :) It's a period drama and beautifully made. I didn't like Daphne overly innocent character though . She reminded me of 50 shades of grey main lead. Also the her wardrobe so sooo dull.,9
North America,"This show was so annoying. The costumes were horrible, it looked so low budget. Daphne was the worst- her dresses and jewelry looked like what a kid would wear, her bangs were horrendous, and I can't figure out the point of whatever they were doing with her eyebrows?! Everyone else had sculpted brows so it's not like they were trying to be historically accurate and it was plain distracting looking at her face. And although all the costumes weren't great, everyone else's dresses were much better than hers. Were they intentionally trying to make her the most unattractive person on the show? Eloise might tie for distractingly hideous dresses. But apart from it the costumes looking cheap, the acting and the dialogue was so boring. I mean it was a real struggle to keep watching it. I don't even want to blame the acting, maybe it was the script? I was so excited as I love period pieces and it looked like it was going to be campy and fun. I will be shocked if they actually make a second season. I won't be watching.",3
North America,"This was just beautiful. From the costumes to the sets to the cast to the script. It was just one of those series, you know the ones I'm talking about, when you've watched the last of the episodes and you're sad that it's over. I wasn't concerned with who was in what role, why they shouldn't be in that role nor any historical accuracy issues. I just loved it for being the story it was. Beautiful.As a side note, I just want to know what happened to the diamond necklace that the Prince had given to Daphne. She took it off when she was on the bridge and that is the last we heard or saw of it. We were distracted when Simon followed her into the garden right after. BUT WHAT HAPPENED TO THE NECKLACE? :O",10
North America,"Take all the bawdy soapy stuff from Riverdale and mix it with Downton Abbey's historical charm and you're getting close to what Bridgerton is all about. It knows it's a little outrageous, and it has a blast being itself.There are a lot of folks complaining about the diverse cast here... and these complaints should point to exactly how cunning this show is. It doesn't give a damn about history or accuracy and instead it wants to give a silly, sexy, and self-aware spin on a genre that is often dusty and stilted. This isn't a period piece for people who long to romanticize and reenact the era this is set, this is a period piece that longs to make people relish the absurdity and charm of period pieces.You can find the joy in this eccentric series if you see just how tongue in cheek it is. It's Marie Antoinette by Sophia Coppola reimagined for bingewatching soap loving audiences and it's delightful.",8
North America,Great casting. It's P&P meets Gossip Girl if the Bennett's were rich and had a baseball team of kids.I loved watching every minute of this and watched it in one sitting. The plot intrigues you immediately; episodes packed a lot of story in 1hr. It's another Shonda hit! Hope there's a season 2!!!,10
North America,Most people are only watching this because there is nothing else to watch. Very dull. Noting special at all. It will only be a success because in pandemic times there is nothing else to watch,2
North America,I read the book about 8 years ago and it was true to the setting and mood!! I absolutely fell in love with the SIMON AND DAPHNE. The music and songs in this series are also beautiful as is the chemistry between our main couple. I recommend this series to everyone.,10
North America,"I, as a black woman, am very happy for the role of Regé, for the performance and delivery to the character. Bridgerton is not perfect, there are things that could be resolved in another way but it was still amazing. Incredible characters. Thank you Shonda!",10
North America,"I've only gotten to episode 3, but it has so effectively pulled me in, I had to pause to review. It reminds me of what an injustice it is that there are no physical markers of heartbreak - no bruises or scars - to keep a record of our agony when we love and lose. It's poignant and painful and artfully acted and positioned to elicit this sort of mournful, relatable feeling.More broadly, I highly recommend it for its fantastic costumes, decor, colour, and cinematography/lighting. Just absolutely brilliant. I love the diversity of characters, perspectives, and internal voices surfacing with consistency but still there is evolution. Just a remarkable show.PS, if you are looking for a new netflix boyfriend, Regé-Jean Page will do the job admirably. He's dashing in such a striking way, I audibly said, ""Wow,"" on more than one occasion.",10
North America,"Good romance and good plot! I did read de books and the alterations are fine, didn't bothered me at all. About the black actors playing aristocracy in 1813, IT IS A FICTION! welcome to tv. Open your minds please. Really worth watching!!!!!!!",10
North America,"The phenomena of color blind casting in historical productions has its origins with socially liberal British producers. In Britain, audiences are more used to mandated diversity casting by some networks in historical dramas which may or may not utilize color blind casting. However, typically American productions do not. I must admit, I prefer to see characters as they would look like in reality, not in a symbolic nature. There are some people who believe exactly what they see & I am not a believer in productions leaving more questions than answers. My opinion is historical productions can have diversity without misrepresenting history. In general though, thoughts about color blind casting are a matter of taste & style. There are no right or wrong answers.",5
North America,"Absolutely loved watching this. The costumes, the acting, the story. I have never read the book but I do like the story very much that is being told. It's never boring as it switches between storylines and gives you multiple characters to pay attention to. I hope they come out with season 2.",10
North America,"I absolutely loved Bridgerton! The costumes were gorgeous and colorful. I enjoyed how they took modern songs and arranged them to sound like classical pieces. If you watch period pieces, you will recognize some of the beautiful locations that were used. The acting was well done, and the storyline was interesting. For me, it ticked all of the boxes that make a period piece enjoyable. It was like a cross between a spiced-up Jane Austen and Gossip Girl. Enjoy it for its entertainment value, not its historical accuracy. It's not meant to be a documentary. I became so immersed in the story that the actors could have been purple and I wouldn't have noticed. I am eagerly awaiting Season 2! I highly recommend Bridgerton!",10
North America,I've read all the books and am thrilled with this telecom series. Season 2 can't arrive fast enough.,10
North America,"I've just binged this in 2 days (between children high on sweets and presents). Definitely not for someone who likes history to be just so but otherwise it's wonderful, colourful, intriguing and full of life. All the characters are played amazingly well and just like a good book you feel fully submerged in their world. I was sad when it ended and I will definitely be watching it again.",10
North America,Totally binge worthy! I loved the diversity and the excellent actors they chose! Watched the whole season in 1 day and really hoping for more soon!,10
North America,"It was beautiful. The story was complex and exciting. The cast truly drew the viewer in and brought the story to life. The scenery and costumes were elegant and brought the viewer into the world. The various storylines were raw, fun, and full of intrigue. Overall, it was a delight full of laughs, tears, and suspense.",9
North America,Omggg... I'm in love with this show. I binge watched it in one day. I love them diverse cast and the plot. I don't want to say to much but I really hope they have a second season.,10
North America,"So after debating whether to watch the edgy Bridgerton on Netflix, I did.
Some may see the full color cast and I applaud their modernization of an old classic but please don't miss the subtext.
The Black Girl gets pregnant out of wedlock and yes of course, the Black Duke is absent his father. Bravo Netflix and thank you for perpetuating another stereotype of old society. Let's not forget that these factual disparities plagued upon the Black race was forced and families broken up purposely to perpetuate a cycle of poverty and strife.I refuse to watch anymore after episode 2 32.15 minutes in.
As a man with a daughter living under my roof and fully supported by her mother and I, this makes me ashamed of those who still write scripts this way and act as if they're preaching solidarity or equality.",1
North America,"For people who gave this series a low rating because they didn't agree with the diverse cast due to the time period, era or etc., please relax, no crime has been committed. It's just TV. This series has drama, romance, and comedy. Simply Entertaining. If you can't get pass the diversity and etc., then you will not be entertained because your stuck in your head to busy comparing your perception of reality to a romance book series or TV series.I remembered my mother watching the movie ""Imitation of Life"" when I was a child, and I remembered not fully understanding the movie until I watched it again at an older age. Being at an older age I also understood that Prejudice and racism didn't allow for a biracial black woman to play the role of a biracial black woman passing for a white woman instead they gave the role to a white woman. However I did understand as a child that the character was crying about her mother. If I understood that as a child, then what is It in the year of 2020 that people can not watch a show with diversity and etc.
""Bridgerton"" was truly entertaining.",10
North America,"All one needs to imagine is Gossip girl in the eighteen-hundreds with the scandals and problems of the time period. A lot of the characters manage to stay quite distant, dispite good enough performances. The sex between the main couple is really emphasized. It got a bit boring. The problems and solutions were very simple. The season was ok. Those who enjoy silly romance dramas will love this. I say meh.",6
North America,"This show was so addicting and so good that I finished the entire season in one sitting.
Bridgerton is awesome if you are an avid lover and reader of historical romance and regency England. It is so refined and elegant but the show still had me eating out of its palm with drama and mystique.Bridgerton is so full of plays out of the feminist playbook it's a wonder it works so well with a dated setting and society. Women taking control of their own lives, finding their own sensual pleasure without men, getting educations and being on the precipice of adventure. This is a world where racism and colorism is a thing of the (very recent) past BUT one in which a society moves forward and places people of color in equal positions of power quickly. And if you are not paying attention, it is hard to find out when that transition actually took place.This is not a show meant to be ""historically accurate"". As some have tried to relay towards their judgment on its entertainment value. This is a show in which modern (2020) music is given a classical and voracious touch of the orchestra. Where young readers, watchers and lovers of ball gowns, secret lives, courting and duels at dawn; especially those of color, can see themselves in stories that are predominantly white and elitist. This show hits all the high notes of romance and sensuality and violence and mystery and suspense and I cannot wait for the second season.",10
North America,It was exciting and interestning and much love in it. And obviously based on a book,9
North America,"I'm in love. Bridgerton is perfect, seeing my favorite characters come to life was amazing. Looking forward to the second season",10
North America,"For those enjoy costume drama, this series won't disappoint but neither will it, I suspect, be long remembered. The writing lacks the confidence and humour of British shows in this genre. While the costumes and sets are as beautiful and sumptuous as we've come to expect, some of the other production decisions, like the CGI cityscapes and one particular horse riding sequence, are jarringly unconvincing. The acting is fine, only sometimes hampered by clunky dialogue which flips wildly between stylised Regency and modern English.It's entertaining escapist fluff and passes the time pleasantly enough, but I'm fairly sure I will have forgotten all about it by next week.",7
North America,"Please ignore any review using the word ""woke"" or stating "" I only watched the first episode"" This is a great period series that only gets better with each episode. I am 5 episodes in and all I keep thinking is that I can't wait for season 2.Let us start with how BEAUTIFUL it is. The scenery, the sets, the costumes....perfect. It is steamy, funny, dramatic, and the ever lingering mystery of the narrating gossip columnist could not be more engaging. And no one can overlook the love scenes.....I found myself holding my breath a time or two?? IGNORE the haters and low raters....this is a fun one that many will enjoy.",10
North America,"As a fan of historical drama I find this very annoying to watch, whether or not you can accept the concept of this being a re-imagining of the Georgian age for me the forced diversity still just feels... for lack of a better word.. forced! But apart from that it's the rich colours that every one wears, the perfectly manicured beards, tresses, make up. The modern dialog, the anachronistic music, I could go on.As a show itself it's pretty standard fare for modern young audiences But the object here seems to be style over substance. So while not dreadful, for me it's only watchable if you can ignore the slick pc correct production.",4
North America,"It's been a long time since I watched a good romantic drama and I'm quite surprised to see low ratings for this show. I'm not familiar with source materials so I'm not going to compare each. The most admirable thing about this show is the way they mix modern music with classical music. The plot is a normal period romance story but the execution of the story is great. In the beginning, I was worried the pace is gone to be slow but guess what the pace is perfect. I'm sure you are gone enjoy this show so much as I do. The first half of the season mainly focused on our main two characters but in the second half of the season, there are few subplots that are good to see. I'm getting bored with romance drama when they focused on just the main couple. This is my first time seen these two performances and they did a great job, I really enjoyed their acting. They have great chemistry on screen. Also, the supporting cast is good especially the queen. The only negativity I see is the predictability of the show. Writers should have done better with the mystery of Lady Whistledown, I notice half of the season who is Lady Whistledown. I am looking forward to the second season and I recommend this especially if you are a fan of romantic period drama.",8
North America,"This show was so wonderful! The drama, the costumes, the 1800s vibes, I loved it all! And such a refreshingly diverse cast for a bit of escapism. The plot was predictable and enjoyable, the wardrobe and sets a joy to watch, and the classical reimagining of modern music was a great twist. The whole thing was a treat for the senses from start to finish. I highly recommend this series to anyone who enjoyed Gossip Girl or Pride and Prejudice and anything in between. Can't wait for the next season!",9
North America,"As an avid Julia Quinn fan, it's difficult not to feel a sense of disappointment during the first 15 minutes of Bridgerton. I have read all the books twice and followed her with excitement on social media since the series was announced. My feelings were a little mixed about the casting, but I knew that if this fit Julia's vision, it would work for me.When the series started, I felt like I was watching an episode of Desperate Housewives. Nothing against Desperate Housewives because I'm a fan, but that's not what I was expecting here. I wanted Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle in Pride and Prejudice. I immediately felt embarrassed to have recommended this with such passion to all my friends. I was disappointed. I almost stopped watching.And then I let go of my expectations about what I wanted the series to be and started to enjoy it for what it is. It's lighthearted and it's fun. I'm glad I didn't stop watching!",9
North America,Wonderful and lovely story play. the duke and duchess actors doing it quite well. definitely renewable to 4/5 seasons. Loved it,9
North America,"I just loved the series, it's perfect so far. I've watched it twice since it premiered and the two times I watched the only thing I did was look underway to my computer screen. The adaptation brought of course many changes, but the essence remained. The main couple is perfect, Simon is wonderful. Anthony can't say the same and I wish he'd get better next season. And that Benedict and Francesca have a real participation in the series, not only in their respective seasons. It is not possible for someone so to have liked this work",10
North America,"The series did not disappoint at all...The main actors chemistry is fire and makes me want to see more. All the characters were amazing the only thing was I didn't get why the featheringtons had all the problems in the series. that was not fair ..When they "" burn for each other"" as said..it was magnificent.",8
North America,"Loved every minute... well casted, beautiful sets.... bring on series 2!!!",10
North America,"I was a fan of the novels. Julia Quinn is renowned for her quick-witted banter & her character - Lady Danbury - is an especially beloved old curmudgeon who infamously delivers the most rapier-like burns. Whoever adapted the books for Netflix is tragically devoid of any wit whatsoever. The writing is awful and so very unfaithful to the novels or even actual history that it is extremely difficult to immerse oneself in this travesty of a universe Shonda Rhimes has created. Terrible screenplay and woke-like revisions of history aside (I say this as a woman of color, FYI), some of the actors were absolutely dreadful. The amount of overacting we were subjected to by certain characters almost made it seem like they were playing caricatures of Quinn's originals. Abominable.",3
North America,"I loved the series completely, the way Simon developed and how he was completely the same as the books, the actors are completely wonderful, I never imagined I would become a fan that easy, the friendship of Penelope and eloise captivated me from beginning to end, completely true to the books.",10
North America,"Just like any adaptation, changes happen and when it comes to bridgertons they were very welcome, black people, feminist speeches and real problems.
Even people who didn't know the books are getting attached to the characters, we can only ask for a second season.",10
North America,Eu amei demais. A fotografia. Os atores e o roteiro. Nao ficou cansativo e maratonei mesmo tudo em um dia!!!!! VEM SEGUNDA TEMPORADA LOGO CARAIIII!,10
North America,Doesn't do justice to the books and the bad acting didn't help.,1
North America,"The actors, the dialogue, the architecture, the art, the colors, the costumes. Everything transfers you to another beautiful world. You almost feel enchanted. It's just so beautiful.
100% a must watch!",10
North America,"The adaptation didn't lose the essence of the series, its changes were not bad, the cast is perfect, I loved it",10
North America,"This series was everything! It was addicting from the very first episode on and I binged it in less than a day! So so good! I highly recommend it!
The characters are brilliant! I will definitely read the books and hope for another season of this amazing show!",10
North America,"Doth not a good make. Another ""new-age"" travesty. If you are making a period piece, albeit a whimsical one, the period facts and feel should be accurate. The acting is stilted most of the time, some younger girl actors are a little gems, but allaround the acting is uneasy and fake. Just as are the dialogues. The choices of the music are a sort of a bribe for a younger audience, but why? Massacres of perfectly good books is obviously a thing now.",1
North America,"This series seems like a mix of Gossip Girl, Downton Abbey and a little bit of Pride and Prejudice. It does however lack the production value of Downton Abbey and the Script of Pride and Prejudice. That being said, it is an enjoyable watch and binge worthy. The actors and actresses are decent enough and the story - if not new - rather compelling.
It started out more or less innocent and became rather hot later in the season, which I truly didn't expect but felt quite new to this genre which made it a nice surprise. The series is very 21st century like. So don't expect a story, characters, costumes and the society to be all that accurate. It seems they wanted to do a more fictional, new take on this era and if it isn't sold as an historically correct show, I see no problem in that.
All in all it is worth a watch if you're looking for a light romance series. Don't expect too much from it, then I think you'll find yourself enjoying this guilty pleasure series.",6
North America,"Bridgerton is impeccable. Soundtrack. Actors. Story. The 1800s are magnificent and bringing her to the screens made everything more incredible. The romance as it is portrayed together with the love of the family, its brothers, in all is an impeccable set. It is worth highlighting the actors' choices. Simon. It's. Perfect. Too anxious for a second season and Anthony's story. Netflix + Shonda = quite a hit. I loved it.",10
North America,"I absolutely LOVED this series!! For me it was an amazing ride of love, challenges and desire. The character development and writing was phenomenal. The scenery and music were absolutely divine and fun! Such a unique and titillating period drama!! I will watch it several times over and if there is a second season to come, I will excitedly anticipate it.",10
North America,"Despite the gloss, few characters are likable and the adult content was gratuitous and added nothing. Pity this story was left in the hands of an American.",3
North America,"This was such a delight. Stellar acting and casting, the soundtrack, the story, EVERYTHING! Netflix and Shondaland are a match that can't be beat. I will be anxiously awaiting a second season!",10
North America,"This was a delightful escape from a bad 2020. The story, costumes, actors etc were all very good. As to the comments about race, here's a bit of history for you; Queen Charlotte descended from the black Portuguese Royal line. She was black. Also, during the Regency period there were black aristocrats. Albeit few in number, they did exist. Nevertheless, this is a fictional account of a period in history told from today's rules where color of skin should not matter when it comes to characters in a show. Hamilton paved the way for this and I certainly hope it continues and we move away from typecasting in film.",8
North America,"I haven't read the book, so I watched the show with no expectations at all and I loved it! I absolutely cannot wait for season 2.",10
North America,"A perfect adaptation of Julia Quinn's books, In addition to having an incredible and diverse cast that brings a lot of representativeness, which is very important nowadays, and it's really sad that there are so many people talking badly about such a good series because of disgusting racism... Anyway watch Bridgerton !! it's a beautiful series and you won't regret it !!",10
North America,Amazing show!! That's how book should be adapted. It was highly addictive and very juicy. I cannot wait for that second season!!,10
North America,"While I was under the impression that I was watching something somewhat related to 1800s, I was distracted a lot by the adapted versions of popular songs playing in the background. Plus the characters are just too superficially portrayed.",3
North America,"I usually love this kind og costume drama, but this one misses the mark. It has been hyped up by the press, but fails. I read that there war a ""sex coordinator"" on site during filming, but for what ? There is not a single scene in this series (first 3 episodes"" that even hints at sex.",2
North America,"The show is incredible.
We need to talk about it: black people was not rich in the history because of the white people. So, please.... stop and accept that this should be the right.",10
North America,"Highly hyped, this disappointed quite a lot. It's the Michelin restaurant equivalent of squirty cream. Light and predictable plot, deliciously over acted, a gentle Sunday afternoon viewing at best - I think the U.S audience will lap it up and think they've had a history lesson. Enjoy!",5
North America,"This show is so much fun! The shows story is so addictive, it really reminds me of gossip girl. The scandals and the salacious gossip are really entertaining and exciting. The music is just fantastic, I loved the string versions of some of this years chart toppers including Ariana Grande and Shawn Mendes. We all need something to brighten up this bleak year. This has everything you could possible want sex, scandal, love and beautiful people.",10
North America,"To everyone who's hating on Bridgerton1) I'm only 3 episodes in to the series but so far I've found it so refreshing and eloquently done
I haven't read the books, but I might start doing so because of the series2) I personally love that the cast is so diverse, it's a nice change from the constant all white cast in period pieces I've seen3) Historically inaccurate - Sure, Fine but it's a welcome change to see how women were terrified of the economic proposition that marriage was back then. It dictated their entire lives and reputation. When it comes to the social classes and hierarchy, it has always been relevant so to see it on screen shouldn't shock people so muchIn conclusion, I'd recommend to watch it. It has the hunts of period pieces we know and love (yearning, slow burn romance, suspense, and drama). It has a perfect combination of gossip, chemistry, well developed characters, and intriguing plot.
Now I'm off to watch the rest!",10
North America,"I had no idea how many black members of the nobility there were in 19th century in London. Apparently it's an alternative London anyway, it seems permanently bright sunshine. It rains only 2 times, because it was conducive to eroticism.
I liked the chemistry between Simon and Dephne, but watching them have sex for a whole episode? Honestly? The show is for kids, but they're not allowed to watch it because of all the sex. Poor historical realization. If you don't understand history, you should leave it alone.",3
North America,"I read and loved these books many years ago. I thought this show was gorgeous. It was never going to be an exact translation from page to screen, and I'm fine with that. It isn't totally historically accurate, but I'm not viewing it as a history lesson. It's a rich, sumptuous, engaging fiction, set at a particular time in London, with a fabulously diverse cast of great actors bringing Julia Quinn's original imaginings of a particular society to vibrant life.",9
North America,"I read the books so long ago and loved them, so I was excited to hear about a Netflix adaptation. I loved it. I think it was wonderfully done. Though Shondaland took some liberties with the story and added plotlines and characters, it stayed true the overall story. I enjoyed it and can't wait to see what they come up with next.",10
North America,I love this series. The characters are well developed.the landscape is beautiful. And the crazy match making balls are dazzling. Its nice to see people of ALL races and colors participating in LIFE. Not just boring white people. They also explain how the main characters became royalty and how that can change at a drop of a hat..this was a great escape movie..nothing more..the acting is fun also..I truly enjoyed this series,9
North America,"I found the perfect series, the chemistry of the main couple is incredible ...",10
North America,"I always loved Jane Austin themed movies and I am so delighted to finally see people of color included, I don't care if it is historically correct. The costumes are stunning, the love stories are captivating, the Duke is the perfect portrait of a real person with baggage like ours,a real man that needs to be loved. The music is incredible, I literally can't find one flaw to these series. You can't stop watching if you start.",10
North America,"I binge watched the show in a day and then crashed into YouTube too see multifandom about the characters. Some commented that creators should stick to the original characters' appearances, however I have to say that seeing people don't judge by their skins color made me so happy. First in ""The Great"", then "" Bridgeton"". Keep making these true pieces of art. Moreover I can't explain how I loved the chemistry between Daphne and Simon. Costumes, decorations, casting all wonderful. I can't wait to see second season",10
North America,Amazing just amazing!!! This serie needs continuation,10
North America,Beautiful history and beautiful colorful. l love this romance,10
North America,"You'll find many nods to Jane Austin in both expressions and situations. Thoroughly entertaining. Binged it in a single day. Not terribly original, but that's ok because I love how many balls they attend, the costumes, the characters....all of it.",9
North America,"The series itself is alright. It had allot of potential but besides the cringeworthy genderroles. While black people around that time existed. It seems like allot of people are offended by the fact that a European historical movie contains black people in a positive position. While that actually existed, there is enough proof just do your research instead of calling it inaccurate.Ironically, the same people offended would care less if Cleopatra was played by a white blue-eyed woman in the middle of africa BC. Or all the other movies where main characters of colour replaced by white actors with allot of make-up. Pure irony. And I'm loving it. Lets change the narrative. Its powerful. If you are offended because you actually think Europeans should be superior in any time of history, you are a part of the problem dear.",6
North America,"This is not historical I guess, it's just a light politically correct show, nevertheless I enjoy it, I usually watch it when I do my nails just to have something in the background. I am not impressed by the acting or costumes or anything else.",6
North America,"I really love this show, the cast is so talent, has very love in this work... thank you for all dedication of all cast.?
I need SEASON 2! ??",10
North America,I don't have a problem with the cast diversity (Hamilton?) I wish they would have used the music of that period as it would have introduced music that many of the viewers have not heard before instead of bad arrangements of mediocre popular songs. I just watched the first episode. It's OK. The acting seems forced and not really believable but the costuming and sets are pleasant to look at. The plot is somewhat intriguing and the fact that Julie Andrews is the narrator will probably keep me watching this.,6
North America,"This is a teen approach to a period drama. Or maybe an American approach, it matter. The fact is that many of the main characters are not well casted. Some of them would be perfect choices for EastEnders or Coronation Street, but not for a period drama. Really, it reminds me of the typical High School American series, but set in the 19th century. The behaviour of the characters is not credible, to put is simply. The plot, such a cliché. When I heard Ariadna Grande and Maroon 5 in the background, played by violins, I couldn't stand more of it. Preposterous. Not credible at all. And Julie Andrews voiceover as if all of it was Wisteria Lane. I needed a G&T after approximately 25 min of it. If I watch the full series I would become an alcoholic.",2
North America,"The plot and the story was very entertaining and utterly romantic. I was hooked from the get go and there wasn't one dull episode the entire season. The diverse cast was so refreshing and I ABSOLUTELY loved it. Binge it or watch it at leisure, it's worth your time for sure. I'm definitely rewatching it over again!",10
North America,"Julia Quinn's ""Bridgerton"" on Netflix is a great adaptation of her work. Moving any book to the screen the writers have to select certain aspect of the storyline to keep it moving. So always remember the books are the books- the series is the series and never the two shall meet. Casting was done spot on!",10
North America,"I fell in love with this family in the books and now on tv, even thought they changed a lot of things, the essence of the books are right there and I thank the creators alot for bringing my imagination to life!",10
North America,Absolutely loved it. The show is romantic and emotional with excellent acting from the two leads. They are passionate and the chemistry is palpable.,10
North America,"The series is IMPECCABLE! from the costumes, photography, soundtrack, the representativeness of the cast was wonderful and the cast itself is incredible ... it's just all perfect. a series to cry, have fun, learn from the characters and their evolution. I can't wait for the second season. it was all AMAZING !!",10
North America,The series is amazing and the characters are wonderful. I'm in love with the Duke,10
North America,In my opinion the best series ever created! The representativeness that the series brought is incredible. I'm in love and looking forward to the second season!,10
North America,Season 2 can't come soon enough for me. And love Julie Andrews as the narrator!!,9
North America,"Loved it, beautiful costumes and houses .great acting would definitely recommend",10
North America,Splendidly and beautifully shot. Costumes and acting award winning. Netflix will sweep award ceremonies. Ma Rainey and now this both of these masterpiece in the same year from the same entertainment company. Netflix is legitimately the King of Entertainment. I bringe watched entire 1 season in 24 hours. I'm bored already awaiting for season 2.,9
North America,"Yes, it is a show, not more, but I enjoyed every piece of it. I didn't read the books so had no expectations. But I loved the story, I loved the diversity in the cast, the utopian fantasy of having people of colour occupying high ranks at those times for me was genius, if only we could change the past... Very entertaining, just what I needed for a relaxing sunday while my husband watched his football.",8
North America,"It's perfect! I really can't understand why some people are so angry for black actors they're playing white characters. When the contrary happens, don't have all this commotion. I think there's a word for that, right?",10
North America,"I am a huge reader of romance and was extremely excited that this series of books was being made into a series.
I loved this show from the opening sequence. The vibrant colors, the people milling about, balls, the season. All of it.
I did not give it full marks because I felt the chemistry between this seasons couple was lacking.
I hope the success of this series helps other romance novels be made into series as well.",9
North America,"The series is good, the actors are good and the story was not the same as the book but it remained similar. I saw all the episodes in one day. It is a romance, a fiction, it does not need to be faithful to the history of the time, it can be represented by actors of all colors. Simon is perfect, Lady Danbury too, they are by the way very similar to their personalities books.",10
North America,"Incredible story, with a good soundtrack and a great cast. In fantasy everything is allowed, only not racism.",10
North America,"I feel like I'm the same and even better than books, I'm in love with the characters.",10
North America,"Wonderful and impeccable plot. The casting was just perfect. The black representation in the series was all good, it was magnificent to see black characters as the protagonist.
I love you, Bridgerton",10
North America,Having read all of the Bridgerton books I can say this series is wonderful. The characters are portrayed brilliantly by the actors and have brought something more to each. I cannot wait to see what they do with the rest of Julia Quinns characters! For those who have issue with casting just stop. As readers we have the ability to imagine characters any way we wish and to see such a diverse group of actors bring these characters to life is impressive. I am going to reread the series with the bonus of having more depth to each character as a result of this first season. Well done to all!!,10
North America,"I have not read the books nor need to . I binged watched the series, and couldn't turn it off. Loved the characters, loved the costumes, and enjoyed the story. It was an entertaining period piece and I loved it.",10
North America,"You should be a fan of the series. Beautiful and so clever. I still don't love Daphne but that may because of Simon! :D Casting is perfection, the story is going in all the right places. Someone who is a true fan of the books will appreciate this series. It's gorgeous. Thank you creators for the bees. I'm just in awe!",10
North America,"The show is perfect
The caracters, the cast, every things was made for us with so much care and atention
I loved It
Can't wait for the next season",10
North America,I love everything about it. As far as live stories go it's got everything you need. Truly an easy watch!,10
North America,"I loved the whole of color and scandal that the Bridgerton series created!!! I loved the thoughtfulness that was shown in including a cast of multiple races!! After the positive novelty of a diverse cast seeped in, I fell into the world that was created!!
I can't wait until season 2!!! ??",10
North America,"What a marvelous show! My copies of the Bridgerton series are but remnants of the pristine books I picked up nearly a decade ago. I applaud how very well done the show is so far and I hope it continues this way or better. As an Asian American actress, it gives me hope to see that Hollywood is choosing more BIPOC talent for such roles.It's time for change. Change is progressive.",10
North America,"Are you kidding me? Ok everyone has a right to their opinion. Coloured? The only coloured people on this earth are white. We go green with envy. Red with anger, white with shock! Etc etc etc This to me was an absolutely fantastic yarn! It bugs me that there is a shameful history. No one is proud. No one is innocent. No one can erase history. And no one should try! But for goodness sake! Go with the flow and just enjoy a fantastic blooming entertaining show! This is NOT a political platform. Still shocked that COLOURED was excepted!!",8
North America,"I am a huge fan of the books and loved season 1!! The chemistry between Daphne and Simon is off the charts! I love the differences from the novel: the diverse cast, contemporary music, etc. Will watch over and over.",10
North America,"I glanced at some of the reviews, and dismissed most.First, the casting was overall well done. The skin pigmentation is inconsequential as the actors embody the characters personalities. Focus on such things perpetuates identities linked to shades of skin rather than the content of ones character. Particularly impressive were Page's Simon and Dynevor as Daphne. They encapsulated the endearing romance and brought those characters to life. My only disappointment was that Page was not given the opportunity to bring forth further the anguish of the childhood struggle/speech impediment that sustained his fear of fatherhood and anger towards his father. This would have further developed his screen character. His portrayal of the duke's character was honest and honorable...but most of all, believable. Page actually surpassed any expectations I had for the casting of this character.Lady Danbury (Andoh) should also be given the opportunity for character development as her role within the novels is both a seamstress of matchmaking but along with that a wit unrivaled by other characters within the novel. Her banter displays her exceptional intelligence and insight.Anticipation for the next stories beautifully develops with the weaving of the characters throughout.Finally, the direction of the series seems to build in accordance with the book series with few exceptions. I look forward to Season 2, and I appreciate Netflix in its ability to seek out new opportunities for varied audiences.",10
North America,"The movie was unconventional, but well written and entertaining. Great choice of actors. I can't wait to see if there will be a season 2.",8
North America,"This show is charming, they managed to address current issues even though everything happened in the 19th century. The cast is impeccable and managed to clearly convey the essence of each character. The main couple Daphne and Simon passed a magical connection through the eyes and this makes any heart beating stronger. Long episodes, however, flow so quickly that they are not tiring. All my satisfaction for this show!",10
North America,"Baffling that no one bothers to look up any actual history when claiming a drama and romance that never claimed to be historically accurate wasn't just that. Queen Charlotte likely was born of African and Portuguese descent if anyone cares to find it. Clearly from her portraits, she wasn't white so it's not so far-fetched there could be other royals descended from other moors and the like. Even if not, slavery wasn't that visible in the UK. Not like America. They weren't picking cotton in England. They used slaves in their other colonies where they had money in sugar cane and spices etc. But if you're that bent out of shape over the mixed race casting or that it's not like the books or that they mix in string quartet versions of pop songs, it's called creative license. Stop whining or having purist ideas of what this should be. The rest of us are enjoying a bit of escapism - yes what is essentially Gossip Girl in an Austen novel - during quarantine and this garbage year. If that's not your thing, no one is stopping you from watching something else.",8
North America,I really loved this series it was like watching a romance novel on screen and the guy that plays the Duke he is scorching the writing was phenomenal and the acting on point,10
North America,"I'd say this series is one part love story from a woman's perspective, one part contemporary, and one part idealist future world where race is (almost) a non-issue.",8
North America,"Amei a adaptação e como é inclusiva!
Os irmãos da Daphne são super carismáticos e o casal Daphmon possuem uma ótima química.",10
North America,"I genuinely loved reading the book series and was very excited when I heard about the adaptation. I just finished watching the 1st episode and while it is obviously a lavish production, I am not pleased with the changes in the way the characters act and behave. I'm not talking about the unique casting - all of the actors are talented and beautiful to look at. What displeases me is the apparent changes to the actual characters. They do not speak, act, or behave like the characters in the books. The names are the same. The setting is the same. The plot premise is pretty much the same but I am very put off by the changes in the actions and speech of the screen characters opposed to the print characters upon which they were based. Beautiful costumes. Beautiful set. Beautiful people. Lousy adaptation.",1
North America,"I haven't read the books that this series is supposedly based on, but why should we really care how faithful the adaptation is? Shouldn't the production sink or swim on its own merits? And all this discussion about whether it's appropriate to have people of different races playing historical figures. In the case of this production, I think discussions of race, feminism and historical accuracy deflect from the fact that it is... boring. If you enjoy watching the same over and over again ad nauseum, tune in. It's a photocopy of almost every PBS period piece I've ever seen. And photocopy in the sense that it's not quite as good as the ""originals."" And there is certainly nothing original about this story. The acting is okay - I doubt Netflix will garner any Emmy or Golden Globe acting nominations from Bridgerton. Costume or cinematography nominations? Sure, why not. Really all I can say about Bridgerton is... m'eh.",4
North America,"I love the books. I'm reasonably happy with the show but ... why the heck is there so much smoking to relax? Frankly it throws me so much out of the scene that I scarcely know what Eloise is saying. Honestly the time for cigarettes has come and gone. These are barely disguised. I'm probably the only person who doesn't think smoking is cool nor do I find it at all sexy or interesting,
Some of the casting choices probably piss folks off but I'm ok with such changes.",7
North America,"Knowing nothing about the books or what to expect from the show, I gotta admit that the diversity threw me in the beginning. By the second episode, I became colorblind and grew completely enchanted by it all that I didn't want it to end.
Although I loved it, to be quite frank, in a way it made me sad. All the diversity.. well, it made me see how the world COULD have been and needs to be.
I eagerly await the second season!",9
North America,"Watch it for what it is, pure entertainment. This is not a history show, why judge it as such. I loved it so much that when it came to the end, I re-watched immediately. I love each of the characters and can't wait for more.
People are so fickle. I'm not in to horror, therefore I wouldn't watch half an episode and rate it poorly. I'd simply go watch what I enjoy and leave it to the horror fans to give a genuine rating.",10
North America,"Pride & Prejudice meets Gossip Girl with a sprinkle of 50 Shades LOL I actually really liked this series and hope there is a second season. Production was beautiful, storyline was captivating and the chemistry between the actors was great! I highly recommend",9
North America,"Lovely romantic period piece that was never meant to be a history lesson. It lightly delves into the absurdities of propriety that still plague our culture today, while elucidating the struggles of women, poc, and LGBTQIA, both in history and our current culture. These topics are just barely touched upon, and instead are illuminated through an entertaining and romantic filter. For those of you who are cringing and complaining about the historic inaccuracies of having poc in starring roles, I would warn you that your racism is showing. This was was never meant as a historically accurate piece (with its larger than life fashion, music and society); if your problem with this series are the poc, then I would suggest your problem does not lie with historical accuracy but instead with deep seeded racism and the advancement of poc within our society. Otherwise you would also be crying that ""Thank you next"" by Ariana Grande was playing at the ball.",10
North America,"Absolutely loved this show, i love the connection between Daphne and Simon (the chemistry between those actors is amazing), the photography, music selection (that modern touch was like breathing fresh air), the wardrobe and the color palettes for each family was so detailed!Perfect for binge watching 2 or 3 times!Thank you Shonda for giving us something great this 2020!",8
North America,"It's disheartening so many people gave this show bad ratings because of the color of the actors. I have not read the books, but LOVED how they were able to rewrite it to include a diverse cast. The book is completely fictional, so changing it around to be a juicy diverse love story brings in more viewers. This was not meant to be a historical representation of the 1800's. For myself seeing people of color play Queens, Dukes, etc. was so nice and refreshing to see because our history was taken from us. Biopic's are cast to represent the true identity of a character and fictional stories are made for rewriting to bring in the masses. So, if you can't see past the color you need to take a deep look at the yourself as a person because you really missed out on a great show! Blacks, Asians, Latinos can play any role in a fictional show and guess what it does not change history, but I'm sure it made a young child of color smile to see people who look like them get cast for a role they normally wouldn't get cast for.",10
North America,"This came up in my ""recommended for you"" list a couple of times, but did not capture my attention. I love period dramas and so yesterday I decided to embark on the series. Captured my attention immediately and held it through the entire series. The storytelling is enjoyable and none of the stories are too laboured, but there is sufficient character development to have you invested. A definite 10 out of 10!!!!!!",10
North America,Binged watched in 2 days - i really hope season 2 comes out soon,10
North America,"Gorgeous, witty, innocent, sexy, poignant, colorful, sexy, quirky, relatable, fantastical, perfection...did i mention sexy? I have not read the books, but plan to now. Im a huge fan of period series, Poldark being my favorite, this is just as enjoyable, with more hot moments btwn the lead characters. Satisfying in every way. Going to rewatch from start to finish once i post this review!!! Dear Netflix, PLZ RENEW!!! We need more!!!!",10
North America,"After reading some reviews I expected some terrible woke, badly written and asinine story but after watching it I found this series quite delightful, interesting and engaging.Granted I have never read the books but I enjoyed pretty much all characters and story lines and the acting was quite good!I hope there will be more!",8
North America,Couldn't stop watching. Loved the romans and story and it the story has some twists and turns I wasn't expecting. Soooo good!!!,10
North America,"Idk why people are upset that the show is not the exact same as the books, that's kind of the point of adaptation. The creative liberties from what I have observed were great! The show is bright, the story lines are not difficult to follow, and you really do feel immersed in this world.I think at times some things were a little annoying, but overall I would say the show is pretty good! Also if you're mad that the cast is diverse....just don't watch the show. I found that part to be especially cool since looking back at history would tell a different story. We can kind of imagine a world where all people are treated similar, are able to have similar ranks, and basque in their individuality (I mean seriously just look at allllll the different hair styles and textures it's really beautiful).Good job Shondaland!",9
North America,"This is such a great show! The best I've seen this Christmas season. Shonda Rhimes certainly knows how to tell a great story. The cast is fantastic. Rege-Jean Page is to die for, and the chemistry between he and Daphne is perfect. I've seen some reviews that say the show is shallow, pretty but insubstantial. And I haven't seen anyone mention where the real substance comes from. It's the unbelievable situation of the women of the times. They didn't know how babies were made? Incredible! They had no idea what happened on their wedding night? Ludicrous! This is as feminist a story as Shonda has ever told.I was actually brought to tears when Daphne told her sister Eloise that she believed she would make her own way in the world. It's so sad, to me, that we have been kept down for so very long. I applaud Ms Rhimes and her excellent producer, Chris Van Dusen, for giving us a beautiful, light-hearted comedy/drama that also speaks out on female disenfranchisement. Bravo!!",10
North America,"I love the show. It's a spiced up regency era drama series that I think Jane Austen herself would find amusing. But would she be equally as appalled at the continued sex scenes? I found myself cringing at the Granville house 'parties'. Not exactly something I expected.
Other than the unnecessary amount of sex thrown in, it's a good show. I do hope for a second series. C'mon Netflix and etc, don't let us fans down.",8
North America,"Loved the show, the cast was perfect, the story addicting, I can't wait for season 2",10
North America,"It starts out as a fantastic and beautifully done period drama with amazing costumes, sets and hairstyles and then the sex starts. And it keeps going. And going. And going. It gets to a point that you just fast forward them to get to the next part of the storyline. It's a great up and down love story but the constant make-up sex is boring and loses its point. Otherwise a good production.",8
North America,Didn't know there were books but definitely going to be looking it up. Regè-Jean Page and Phoebe Dynevor had an amazing chemistry. Binged watched the whole thing in one day!,10
North America,"This is a very good start to what I hope will be a very long series.
As a book lover I couldn't be happier.
I'm sad to see the bad reviews; people must keep in mind that this is fiction, and it is a very good production.
Congratulations to all the professionals involved, I think you are on the right path, please don't let the negative reviews throw you down. All the book clubs that I belong to, absolutely loved it.
Don't keep us waiting long for the second season.",9
North America,"I have no issue with the diverse cast, it shouldn't make a difference to story telling unless the piece is heralded as historically accurate in every way. Because of that I also don't care that the costumes are at times, beautifully elegant and then in other scenes look like an explosion in Laura Ashley! Again, that's not why I give it a mediocre score. I watched four episodes back to back and just could not really describe four hours of story. I felt that just nothing really happened. It felt a bit repetitive rather than a sharp game of wits played by the two lead characters. This is of course my review and my opinion.
I find comments such as ""check your privilege"" to be quite offensive to the people who wrote in here. This is a movie review by normal movie watchers. Does being a hard working, reasonably successful white woman preclude any opinion that allows freedom of expression? Lest you be judged as a racist!! This is where inclusivity and changing the norm may fail as opinion and thoughts are judged and repressed.
I didn't give a rats fig that three of the main characters were privileged black characters including Queen Charlotte! I only thought about it when I read a comment on Facebook. Am I surprised given some of the rhetoric that black actors would be involved in a project about the privilege of riches on the back of slavery? Oh no. That's right, I actually don't care because actors are adults and can make their own choices on who to portray and of that portrayal fuels the legacy of that period. Bravo to everyone I say. It's entertainment.",6
North America,"I had read the books a long time ago and when i saw the trailer for the first, i couldn't believe they were being adapted into a series. I was nervous at first, because adaptions rarely match the expectations of fans and this genre of books are well never really adapted.
Having now finished watching the series, i would say, i loved it! The series is very engaging and fun. The diverse cast was distracting at first and difficult to ignore. But by second episode it made sense and made the series even better! The casting for Daphne was perfect! I could see myself falling in love with her character, she acted so well.
The only thing that left me wanting was that I would have loved to see more of London of that time through their eyes.",10
North America,"Perfect, the cast is the best! Wonderful to see my Bridgertons, all very beautiful.",10
North America,"The series is just perfect. A gift for book fans, as the adaptation captured the essence of the story and all the important references are there. I'm looking forward to the second season.",10
North America,"It was so rewarding to watch this show, with this spectacularly amazing and charming cast. Rege Jean as Simon was amazing, it looked like he was born specifically for this role, it was extremely satisfying to see him. Not to mention Nicola's perfect performance with Penélope, it was lovely.",10
North America,"Can't wait for the next series. Easy to watch, and I couldn't stop watching .",10
North America,"I highly recommend giving Bridgerton a watch especially if you like romantic dramas. It's a lavish delight of a drama in a opulent setting. It's important you don't expect the subtlety of Austen - yes, this is a Georgian era romance but written and then adapted for a modern audience - but in simplest terms, smash Austen with Gossip Girl and you get Bridgerton.So yes I've read all of Julia Quinn's books and love the Brigderton family. Is this the same? No. Is it therefore bad? Also no. I just do what I do with every other TV show/movie of books I love and compartmentalise them into separate things. The characters are somewhat different from their book selves, but from what you can see from the first season, it allows greater character development to occur that is more fit for the TV screen. I loved the inconclusion of Marina, a minor character from the 5th book in the series based on Eloise story, it added extra depth to the series.I have a history degree and read voraciously so yes, I'm aware of the historical inaccuracies. However, I'm also aware this is a work of fiction, a delightful romp through a somewhat Georgian period of English history with marriage minded mamas and men trying to avoid the parson's trap. I'm not watching this looking for a history lesson, and if you are you're doing life wrong.The use of POC actors is vaguely explained with a comment partway through the series to do with the King falling for a POC and marrying her, thus making way for an inclusive society, but to be honest I don't think it was necessary. The best people for the roles have them. Despite comments on the woodenness of acting, I think the casting is great, particularly Adjoa Andoh for the society matriarch, Lady Danbury, Nicola Coughlan as Penelope Featherton, and Regé-Jean Page as Simon Bassett, The Duke of Hastings. The actors do a great job of injecting life into the script.The only character I was unsure about the changes for was Daphne - she is younger in the show than in the books, in her first season rather than her second. I think some of Daphne's depth is lost due to this. Book Daphne was beautiful but men quickly saw her as a friend (something to do with growing up in the country with 3 older brothers and being particularly close to Colin, her closest in age). She wasn't desperate to marry and indeed new she didn't have to (the Bridgerton Viscountancy wad thriving and if any daughters chose not to marry they would always be supported) but did want children, thus concocted a scheme with Simon to have her seem more desirable. Turning her into someone who cares about not much more than making the best match does the witty, gracious character from the books a huge disservice, losing some of her close relationship with her older brothers too. I feel like her character is the only real change from the book that I take issue with. Hopefully they can keep a little more true to the essence of the Brigderton family characters for any additional series and their own stories.",8
North America,"You can rely on Netflix to splash the cash when it comes to a series of this kind, and Bridgerton doesn't disappoint with beautiful houses, lavish parties and exquisite clothes. I found myself suppressing a laugh at some of the men's hairstyles which made them look like 1950's Teddy boys, which I am sure was not intended.
It's a handsome series - the Bath settings are thoughtfully and artfully reproduced, and the plot is better than average with a whole string of Bridgerton siblings needed to be married off. Everybody seems to happily live with what seems like the double standards of the era, and Julie Andrews' Lady Whistledown is a plot masterstroke.
I am really enjoying it, even if it seems to veer between Mrs Gaskell, Jane Austen and Jilly Cooper. It is very good entertainment and I am looking forward to a second season.",7
North America,I Love the adaptation! Let the second season come!,10
North America,"Bridgerton is a reimagining of Regency London and it deals with a young aristocratic woman looking for love and a financially adequate husband in her aristocratic circle. I was fooled by the trailer and yesterday I gave it a shot.Unfortunately I couldn't go through the first episode. Even as a ""reimagining"" of 19th century London, it is frivolous, caricatural and foolish. The plot is shallow and the acting unbearably overplayed. Since it doesn't have much to say, sex scenes are scattered here and there together with ridiculous dresses, vests, hairstyles and wigs. Dialogues seem to have been written under the influence of alcohol.The queen looks and behaves like a fishwife and as such receives her guests lying back in her throne in an overcrowded narrow room, which makes me wonder if anybody in the production has ever visited a Royal Palace.Even the opening credits are horrendous and badly made.Do yourself a favor and skip it.",1
North America,"Great production!! I'm always unsure when books I like or love are translated to screen. I read every genre but still have a soft spot for my Georgette Heyer, Austen and other good regency romance writers. Bridgerton is very well done and I want the rest now. I'm very happy with the, A Knights Tale style slightly modern/different take with regard to music, dancing and costumes. The wit and humour of the books is not coming across but that may not be a priority for this production. Even so I'm sticking with my 10 star rating.
I'm already watching it over again and have new Bridgerton converts in the family. The proof was when I asked on Christmas Day did they mind if I watched the first episode just to satisfy my craving and then we could do whatever else they wanted. They then insisted on watching the lot! Never did that before.
I also liked that they used actors of colour to portray some aristocratic families or servants just the way it could have been if not for slavery or prejudice. Very interesting.
Thank you Netflix!! Thank you Shondraland!! Second series please!!!",10
North America,"It takes a clever team indeed to take a historical romance book series, which focuses on the happily-ever-after one one couple per novel, and make it into an ensemble cast with a strong through-narrative. Yes, many changes were made when comparing to the source material. Yes, the costumes and events aren't meticuously period-accurate. But the unique effervescence of Julia Quinn's Bridgerton family books is what has been brought to the screen. The decision to offer a female-focused, female-gaze perspective to Regency life, sex, self-actualization, and identity in love is what we needed from this new historical romance series. The spirit and overall arc of the characters is what Van Dusen and Shondaland have given us, and that is what matters most.",10
North America,"Incredible actors, wonderful production, great script and does not deserve the racist attacks he has been suffering, because it is a series of FICTÍCIA history and not historical (based on real or historical facts, but yes fiction). Accept that there will be black protagonists YES! AND ALL ARE GREAT ACTORS.",10
North America,"To evaluate a highly produced series with 1-2 stars just because there are black characters is RACISM
where is your sense? black people exist and deserve to be portrayed equally to whites in cinematographic works, there is no use ignoring
and about the ""excuse"" of the time, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD IS A FICTIC SERIES, THERE IS NO REASON FOR THIS TO BE A REQUIREMENT FOR ONLY WHITE PEOPLE IN THE CAST",9
North America,Held your attention which is impressive given that not a lot happens. Some of the characters could have been developed more but no doubt there will be further series. Thought the overall storyline around the oath a little weak.,8
North America,"Love this adaptaption of the first book. Is it true to the book 100%? No, but it keeps the original vibe of fun and sassy and keeps a viewer entertained. Watched the whole season in one sitting!",10
North America,"I love this series.It has brought all the characters I love to life and I spent 8 hours enjoying the opulence of Regency life, the loving and maddening Bridgerton family, the scandals, the extra story plots giving the characters more depth and of course the passion.The creators have made a brilliant job of bringing Julia Quinn's stories to life and giving a fresh, enticing feel to them.I will always love the books but this series has made them come more alive in my imagination now.Now for the long wait of series 2",10
North America,"I wait 5 ages for this, and I love so much. Penélope & Colin are the best couple forever!!!",10
North America,"The choice of black actors was at least interesting. Is that a problem? Not really. In a perfect world, people would be bothered by the lack of black actors in period adaptations and would try to understand why. Perhaps that would solve some issues in today's society (yes, we live in a world that is still racist, don't be so shocked).
What was not that interesting was the breaking of customs, it denies the history more than the presence of black actors. I am confused by the need to integrate the society of the 21st century into the 19th century. But was it enough to make the show a disaster? Again, no.
Now let's talk about what really makes it a disaster: the books.
When Bridgerton's rights were acquired, it wasn't the big hype or the large amount of books sold around the world that were bought, it was the story, and that's where the production failed miserably.
Bridgerton is about family, it's about mutual support and love, a lot of love.
Each character is an important part in the construction of this family, somewhat eccentric for the time, but still functional and highly respected in society.
The production gave us none of this. It turned the books into a reality show.
It delivered a foolish Anthony, nothing like the responsible man that are always concerned about his family that we see in the books. His story with the opera singer was shameful to watch. It completely destroyed his character in exchange for nothing. Anthony is a libertine, yes, but leaving the family aside to be with his mistress? Wanting to introduce her to the society? Act like a passionate and jealous man, when everyone who has read the books knows that romantic love doesn't interest him for personal reasons? Completely hateful.
Violet did not show herself as the loving and respected mother, Colin was not the charming gentleman, Lady Danbury was not the sarcastic and rude woman that everyone loves to hate. A complete change of personalities.
That was the real problem of the show, the lack of fidelity to the book and its characters..
I don't care if the show is going to be portrayed on Mars, in the year 3000 full of romantic alien couples. But when you say you're going to adapt the story of a book, do it. Do not create a new story, this is not your role, the author already done that.
That's what I expected from Netflix and Shondaland.
If you haven't read the books, or even if you have read it and liked the adaptation, very good for you, really. You don't have to agree with me.
But if you read the books and didn't like it, like me, let's just hope that the second season will be more faithful and brings out the best of the characters.",1
North America,"I usually don't like romance movies or TV, but I really fell in love with Bridgerton! And all the romantic drama that came with it!!! What a marvelous storyline, actors and costumes. There are so many twists and turns in the plot that I was never bored... not even for a second. Well done!!! A must watch!!! I can hardly wait for season 2!!! Please hurry!!!",10
North America,"I love watching costume dramas and literary adaptations, especially at Christmas. The period in which this is set is my favourite, being a long-standing fan of Jane Austen, but this is very different. That said, I love the costumes and sets and the insight into Regency society.
I know a lot of people have issues with the casting of POC, and I know it isn't necessarily historically accurate but people need to get over themselves and just enjoy it for what it is. The Duke is as handsome a leading man as any other literary hero, and it shouldn't matter what colour his skin is.
I haven't read the books so I don't know how accurate it is but it's entertaining enough. As a friend and fellow costume drama fan put it: 'any costume drama is better than none at all'.",6
North America,"It is good more weak performances and could be better and if you have a 2 season that fix the mistakes.
Personality changes I didn't need because in the books they were very good and even better than presented in the series.Maybe if I had never read the books and saw how Just inspired by the books I wouldn't have expected anything much better and in the essence of the books.",4
North America,"When I learned there will be a Netflix series based on Quinn's Bridgerton books I was very excited for it. Now after watching all episodes (and it was very painful watching it I must admit) I'm very dissapointed. Like some others I wasn't thrilled about very benevolent casting, but let's put that sideways and focus on the transmission of the story about Daphne and Simon from the book to the screen.
There was only very few moments which I recognized from the book. I'm really trying to understand that netflix had to have a show and stuff but it's really hard to do so because they basically ruined one of my favourire book. Many of the sidestories(NOT in the book originally) were very unnatural to Quinn's vibes and very unnecessary. I don't know if J. Quinn had any word with how this is gonna turn up, but to me it feels like there is 1% of the book and rest is... well rubbish. Let's face it....
It's hard to explain to people who have not read the books how devastated I was when I saw what they've done to Anthony and I'm not talking about the plot with his mistress. I'm talking how they created this monster brother who forces his sister to marry a man she does not desire when in the book is exactly opposite.
How Simon and Daphne told everyone their courting was just a game (eventually) except Anthony who was the only one to know it in the books (from the very beggining). The situation about Simon lying Daphne that he cannot have children and everyting following that situation. Except the duel scene and the bedroom scene(which was only partly like in the book) there was everythintg wrong. The complete queen storyline was absolutely unnecessary.
And then few unimportant details like Daphne isn't in her first season, Daphne's hair colour, that their first, second or third child is not a boy and so on and on.. That are some details which can be quite easily transmited to the series but for some reason they haven't done that...
And not to mention they told everyone who is Lady Whistledown right now... In the books you don't know (unless you figure it out on your own) until the middle of the book 4...
I have to give some stars for beautiful locations and some acting.. sometimes..
If you are not a fan of the books I guess you could be able to like this. If you are a fan of the books there are two possibilities. One is not to watch it at all and stick with the books which are so beautifully written or you can watch this and appreciate the books even more.
If there is next season of this I beg creators... stick to the original story. It will be much better.",3
North America,"If you haven't read the books, you simply must! Julia Quinn is a genius at making romance novels not just romantic, but hilarious, charming, and addicting. The series is wonderful too although there are certain liberties taken (as there always are when taking a book to the screen). It's binge worthy for sure!",10
North America,"Is the best, is so beautiful!!!!! You must see it immediately. You won't regret it!!!!!!!",10
North America,I haven't seen such a good show in a long time. It only took me a day to finish it. All I can say is that I can't wait for season 2.,10
North America,The characters are so cool and the actors play very well. Even convinced me that I wanted to live in the 1800s.,10
North America,"I created this IMDB profile to review this series. Lots of folk chatting about it being too woke got me going. To be honest it has a million historical flaws, it inaccurately portrays the period so badly that one almost can imagine a vauxhall corsa coming round the Royal crescent to pick up the characters. It is still an amazing watch which I thoroughly enjoyed. For those that go on about the actors being the wrong shade of pink, please get over yourselves and watch it for what it is... beautiful, perfect escapism. Loved the black queen she was fierce and majestic, the ""English roses"" were very good at swooning, the leading man dashing, there was amazingly camp slapping and prancing. What more does one need during lockdown???Please watch this for what it is... not what it should be! If you need historical accuracy, watch a documentary instead. If you enjoy a slightly camp romp with lots of costume and intrigue, then pour yourself a gin and enjoy it.",10
North America,"Muito bem ADAPTADA, roteiro incrível, fotografia impecável e o elenco é MARAVILHOSO. Um elenco diverso e representativo o que atualmente é essencial nas produções.",10
North America,I Saw this series and despite being a little different from the book i liked Very mutch. the resemblance is incredible and perfect in some scenes. And the differences between the book and the series are necessary to make the plot more vivid.I do Love this series and became perfect.,10
North America,"The series is amazing, a litle difference to the books, but in this format it was incririble.",10
North America,"... I know I do. The novels sparkled and were a delight. So fun!To be fair, the TV series does have great costuming and sets, but that's pretty much it. In fact, the producers seem to make that their biggest focus, instead or character development. The casting is just wrong, the story isn't fun at all, and the gratuitous sex is just ... well, gratuitous.",1
North America,"I've read the books a few years ago and was amused by its wit and interesting plots. I was pleasantly surprised when I heard the books are finally being turned into a series. I have to say I am also pleasantly surprised by the diverse cast and hope I see even more of that in the future. Yes, this is not a dull British period series, we already have plenty of those. What we really needed was something light and funny and as further as possible from 2020.",10
North America,I really enjoyed this series!! I didn't read the books so I didn't really care that it doesn't follow them exactly. Oh and I have an open mind so I didn't really care that there was a black queen in that time period. Geez people!!,10
North America,"I absolutely loved this series, once I got it straight in my head that it is not another Downton Abbey. Other than the fact that it states it is set in 1813, nothing about this show is historically accurate. There is not even a nod to propriety or history, but don't be disappointed by that. Enjoy it for what it is, a wonderful fictional show. The costumes in the first two episodes are wonderfully flamboyant and entirely over the top, as are the sets and scenery. You get a full data dump in the first episode, so be ready to absorb the characters in all their impropriety. After that most of the costumes are toned down, almost to the point of being boring. There is romance and intrigue happening all around you, so keep a sharp eye. If you blink you'll miss too much! The story line and acting was delicious. I loved every character and am ready to binge watch it again! If you're looking for a very good synopsis of each episode check it out on Vulture.",10
North America,"To start I have not read the book. Somehow it did not cross my path even though I love period books as this. My favorite author being Georgette Heyer and Jane Austin a close second. I am from a diverse family myself and have no issue with creative license to make a fictional story that does not match historical accuracy if it understood it is fiction and it took such liberties as it did, an example being modern tunes played by an orchestra. But, this series does not live up to its potential.While the settings and costumes are vibrant the characters are lackluster, dull, boring or annoying like Eloise. The characters did not come across as they should by either bad script, bad casting and at times both. Pen's character is the exception and came across as the most believable. She portrayed real and true human emotions and was neither dull or annoying and the actress played her well. Overall this is a series to watch if you in the mood for a period piece and can overlook the liberties it took and dont expect a masterpiece as some give it but it not a total garbage rating as haters gave it., so in the middle rating i give it, no more than that, too much dull writing and bland characters to give this anymore than a 5 or 6 star rating.",5
North America,"I don't normally want to watch things like this. I will admit to that up front. Wife has waded through enough of my SciFi preference I feel I owe it to her. Sometimes I can be happily surprised. This was not one of those times.My biggest complaint is it just wasn't good. I sat through a lot of Greys Anatomy and while much of it was cringe worthy some of the story arcs were interesting. I probably gave up on that show after no less than 5 years, maybe 6. I was shocked to learn it was still going strong a couple years ago but apparently people like it. Brdigerton is based on a novel(s?) that seem to be highly acclaimed, which initially led me to believe I might enjoy the show. I get the impression they seriously misfired on the original material.I have never been what anyone would consider a prude but I think a show better be able to stand on its story and the nudity should just be unnecessary window dressing. This show will be fine for those looking for window dressing. Everyone else need not apply.Meanwhile, we are really getting swamped in this 2020 wokedom. Novels have always been the best medium for creativity but woke is destroying period fiction/non-fiction unnecessarily. Series and films should be trying to create the settings as laid out by the author or go write your own material. It would be just as distracting if Kunta Kinte first ran into the slavers in the forest, it was Jack Nicholson out hunting a guinea. As fine an actor as Jack Nicholson obviously is, he would have ruined that film (rather the producers would have should they have made that casting decision).I am not going on to episode 2. Show gets a 3 because production quality and actors do well.",3
North America,Not worth watching. What a disappointment. Netflix should use their money to produce better shows.,1
North America,"The series managed to tell the story beautifully by inserting issues of diversity and important themes without changing the essence of what is told in the books. The changes that appeared served to add drama and as a connection for the next seasons. I loved the cast, the scenery and the costumes. The soundtrack with current songs played by the Vitamin String Quartet is a bonus. Great entertainment. Looking forward to the second season.",9
North America,Modern life ideas on period dramas! Not bad i must say. But whats the point? Made in C /only way is Essex vs women's rights? We are not getting out of the wigs here are we?,6
North America,"Vivian Leigh, a Brit born in Calcutta played Scarlett O'Hara, the daughter of an Irish plantation owner in the American South
Natalie Wood, the daughter of Russian immigrants, played Maria in West Side Story
John Wayne played Genghis Khan; Burt Lancaster played Cochise; Mickey Rooney played Japanese in Breakfast at Tiffany's.
People only object to diversity casting when it goes agains their prejudices.
And diversity casting or not, this series is great...especially for those who wouldn't be caught dead reading a Romance novel.",10
North America,"I really like the book series and this first Netflix season (book # 1) does justice to the feeling of reading them. Romantic, beautiful, sweet moment, funny dialogues and heartwarming about a delightful family. Nicely done, genuine romance feeling and a big: I like. Looking forward to more.",8
North America,"I was enchanted in the first episode, I'm completely in love. I can't wait for the second season",10
North America,"Simply in love with seeing this adaptation of one of my favorite series!
Especially the fact of bringing black characters, this is incredible, we need to see ourselves at the top too! Do not get attached to the historical period, your racism will not pass!!",10
North America,"Loved this series. The costumes, the use of the English language, the scenery and the Queens hair. Julie Andrews is icing on the cake. Highly recommended.",10
North America,"First sat down to this and was amazed just how OTT the PC brigade had been in this. Some worked like the Duke and the Queen but the others were certainly not cast for their acting skills. The main characters were distinctly unlikeable, however the duke Simon was quite tasty to the eye. As was the rather attractive Anthony. The only characters I actually liked were the aforementioned Anthony, Eloise, who was actually a revelation and I rejoiced every time she was on screen and Simons guardian. What annoyed me most however was the obvious lack of screen chemistry between the 2 central characters.",5
North America,I didn't read the book nor do I enjoy period dramas but DAMN this was good!!! The chemistry between them is soo damn palpable. Also the costumes are so wonderful and I just love the casting. A wonderfully fun romance.,10
North America,"I really hope I'm missing some big trick here and no one is genuinely taking this seriously. Please tell me for my own sanity that viewers at least realise it's absolute trash, as either a romance or a drama, but go along with it for the pompous, costume-y ride?Historical accuracy is out of the window, but as it is fiction, that's fine. But woe be all of us if our media consumption returns to the 'boobs and swords' era of the late noughties that this series mind-numbingly revitalises.The age rating certification given to this (15) actually surprised me, mainly due to the fact that anyone of viewing age or above shouldn't find anything contained in it as exciting, novel, shocking, nor interesting.Sniff.",2
North America,"It's definitely watchable if you don't mind the repeated bonking towards the end which gets annoying after a while and there is no way on this earth that a regency duke would be talking to a debutant about masterbation! If those two comments put you off then it is not for you. I like the large non white casting except on one point which is referencing the King marrying a black woman where as Queen Charlotte was definitely not and she was also much more in love with her husband and genuinely distressed by his condition than this rather callous and wholeheartedly unlikable character is. Cast a a black women in the role but be colour blind to the casting as in David copperfield, don't rewrite history to make a point. If you want to understand a better history of the era then watch The Madness of King George which is closer.",8
North America,Frothy American soap fantasy with curious cultural misappropriations - I got through half of episode one before deciding life was too short and precious.,1
North America,Good production. I did not read the books so I can t tell how were they adapted. I don t mind the diversity issue. Good vibez,8
North America,"Let us speak of a simple truth. If you are ok with people waltzing to Shawn Mendes 200 years before he was born, ok with women in their mid-30's playing young teenagers, ok with huge anachronistic liabilities yet are not ok with a black duke, a black Queen, an interracial relationship, a black man with a white servant, then you are a racist. Whether you like it or not, you are a racist. Grow up.",10
North America,"I'm a huge fan of period dramas, I've watched all tv and film adaptations of Jane Austen's novels and other classic period pieces, so when I heard about a new show set in regency England, I knew I had to watch.Years ago, I also read the book series by Julia Quinn on which this series is based, and even if I don't remember everything, this has always been my favorite of the lot and the one I remember the most.While not exactly the same, I believe this is a very faithful adaptation, at least in spirit, and I loved every second of it! The actors, the costumes, the sets, the music everything was excellent and vibrant. Indeed, this series, reminded me of the movie Emma, which came out last year, and was a more modern, racier adaptation of the beloved Austen classic. I appreciate the use of a diverse cast, and don't understand what the fuss is about really. All the actors were great (particularly the actress playing Lady Danbury), and now, I can't imagine reading the books again without picturing them in my mind. I really hope they continue adapting the other books too!In conclusion, this was a beautiful, sweet, funny, sexy show, that I highly recommend to all the fans of period dramas and books. Forget about historical accuracy and just enjoy the show for what it is, you will not regret it!",10
North America,This show was so easy to binge and fun to watch. I am glad I didn't pay attention to the bad reviews.,10
North America,"Brilliant costume, sets, scriptwriting and acting. Could do without the 'skin colour' speech in episode 4, I'd come to terms with it not being historically accurate in the first 20 minutes - I didn't need an explanation. The splendour is just lovely and I really enjoyed immersing myself in this series. A good series about love and responsibility.",7
North America,"Loved it! I love the books, and because I have been disappointed before with adaptations of books that I really like, I did not create expectations about Bridgerton. Best thing I've ever done! The adaptation is really very good in every detail, and even the small changes in the narrative were very welcome. And the detail I liked the most, apart from the cast (which is just wonderful), were the songs that served as background for the balls. I loved that contemporary touch.",10
North America,A must watch. History and fiction meet for pure entertainment. I loved the idea of the 1800s coming to life with many people who were different. Looking forward to session 2.,10
North America,Missed some of the scenes from the books but overall 10/10 would and will watch over and over and over again,10
North America,"Fantastical soap opera period piece.
The diverse cast is utterly swoon-worthy. I also appreciate all the new faces - none bring prior characters they're known for to this story.
I'm keeping fingers-crossed that there's more seasons to come (apparently the book series are 8 in total - one for each Bridgeton sibling).
Aside from the main characters, I really enjoyed Eloise played by Claudia Jessie.",10
North America,"To all the people who are writing reviews based on the races and nationalities of the actors...you realize that this show is fiction, yeah?",9
North America,"Bridgerton was an delicious dreamy Christmas treat! It was such a fun and totally sexy show to watch! The costumes, sets, music and acting were delightful escapism fitting for the last week of a challenging year.I was not a long time fan of the book series but read them once I saw the preview for this show. I started reading romance for distraction and comfort during the pandemic and was excited to see a romance novel used as a source material for tv! Just like all romance novels the plots of the Bridgerton book series and first season of the show are predictable and formulaic but comforting at the same time. You know there's going to be problems but things will come together in the end. Don't come looking to find a shocking unexpected plot. That being said you will find characters with depth and beautiful stories about love, vulnerability, and family. I was happy with the adaptation of the characters and the changes they made to the plot.I'm disappointed with the negative reviews regarding the diverse casting. I understand the need to be aware of not erasing history but that's not what's going on here. Bridgerton is a fantastical 21st century romance story set in the 19th century. It's refreshing to have black actors cast in a period piece. It's refreshing the see Rege-Jean Page play a duke in a romantic lead. I never got the feeling that Bridgerton was trying to do anything but provide a romance with representation. All the haters need to get over it and really look into their hearts at why a black duke in a fictional story bothers them so much.Winners:
-Anthony: Jonathan Bailey was the best actor of the ensemble in my opinion. Fans of the books might be disappointed in how Anthony struggles in the show but I think they gave Anthony's character so much room to grow.
-Eloise: she was a joy and even more fun than in the books. She provided as space for feminist critique of the restrictions of their society.The actors had amazing chemistry and it showed!Criticisms:
Don't be mad... I loved it and can still have critiques...
-The diversity was amazing but I did notice that almost all of the black actresses were light-skinned and there were very few dark-skinned actresses with speaking lines. If you're going to have a diverse cast it might be a good idea to be a bit more conscious of that.It didn't go unnoticed that they chose to cast a black woman for the role of Marina, one of the only tragic storylines from the series, and they expanded it with an secret pregnancy! If you know the books you know her story is not a happy one. Just a bit disappointing to add a black character that doesn't get to have a happy ending like everyone else.Consent. I was wondering if they were going to change the Daphne/Simon conflict in the show but it was even more glossed over and downplayed. I felt like they could have done a better job at addressing consent and trust in Simon and Daphne's relationship.Overall I loved it even with its flaws. You should watch it if you are looking for a pretty romantic drama.",9
North America,"The show is amazing, and embodied the soul os the books and characters!
The casting was AMAZING, the soundtrack classic yet modern, the scenery delightful!",10
North America,"It's a Harlequin Novel. It's a Harlequin Novel. It has a big budget and some trendy/edgy choices that try to hide it, but in it's soul, IT'S A HARLEQUIN NOVEL.K, now you know EXACTLY what to expect, plot, writing, romance, and character-wise.They stuck some modern day glittery gunk on it to make it more appealing to a younger audience, who might be in denial about liking the same historical-romance-novel guilty pleasure as the 40+ crowd, and to make it seem like more than it is.Expect things like garish, modern fabrics in the costumes, explicit and plentiful sex scenes, and harp versions of Ariana Grande songs playing at the balls. And the diversity cast everyone is gushing over is tailor-made to distract the 15-25 crowd who would otherwise quibble about the traditional, patriarchal romances (I'm not buying it. If they were doing true Hamilton casting rules, WTH are the Asians? Where are the Hispanics? Either have an actually diverse cast, like in ""the Personal History of David Copperfield"", or stick with a historically accurate one)You'll either find the modern touches fun, or deeply grating on your soul (if ""A Knight's Tale"" bothered the bejeesus out of you, avoid this. If you thought ""Reign"" level costuming and historical accuracy wonderful, you'll be fine) I somewhat feel a more accurate setting would let one appreciate the full junk-food romance of this better, since it would remove the posturing and trying to be edgy and relevant, and let it be what it is, a Harlequin Novel.As for book series accuracy, I'd say it's about as close to the books as the ""Ella Enchanted"" film is to its source material (which is to say, not really, and set in a different world. Book fans, you have been warned.)I wouldn't watch this with other people. It's the screen version of that-time-of-the-month chocolate: intended to be consumed solo, shamefacedly, and voraciously once others are out of the room.",5
North America,"I have never read the books. I was skeptical when I saw the unusual casting but I gave it try because the Duke is very handsome. And it was awesome. I didn't like the weird casting of ""Cursed"" but this one is perfect. Forget about colors, history and races just look at the beauty of everything and enjoy.",10
North America,"Seriously I'd expect this type of show from Americans not the British, everything about the series is nothing new to me. I have seen countless stories like this show and honestly am bored, no mystery, intrigue nothing at all to keep me interested... only character worth watching is the girl who prefers to live her life rather than obsess about marriage, I don't think they handled race well in the show, I think we all know what black went through then, why sugarcoat it and make it seem like white people and black people then saw themselves as equal in England, am black but I'd prefer they made it how it really was in that era, it was weird seeing how black people was represented in the show.
another thing I like about the show is the cinematography, whoever did all those background scenes and finding such beautiful locations deserve a Grammy, I was more interested on how beautiful the town is than the story itself",5
North America,"This serial looks pretty, and appeared to promise an interesting new angle on regency period drama, in the same vein as The Knight's Tale and medieval England, but it turned out to have major flaws. Above all the sheer quantity of gratuitous soft porn sex scenes...maybe this works in a certain segment of the US market, but I doubt that it will please a more discerning UK and European audience. I could eventually accept some of the many glaring anachronisms (eg Offenbach's 'Belle Nuit' in 1813?!), but why on earth use the very well known real name of 'Cliveden' with locations which are quite patently nothing to do with that place?
Period fantasies can work well, for example the contrast between Bridgerton and the wonderful Harlots series is massive. Hard to believe a second season is apparently to be dredged up. Bright points were some of the acting performances, notably the Duke and Duchess of Hastings, Lady Danbury and the Duchess's mother.",3
North America,I don't have much to say except I stopped watching it after 3 episodes. I tried to like it but there was nothing to like.,1
North America,"I wanted to love this show, and for the first half i really did! the costuming and casting is amazing. it's a lot of fun. the string covers of modern songs was a nice touch. i liked a lot of the characters and enjoyed getting to see a variety of relationships develop. and i was really rooting for daphne and simon, at first. but (*SPOILER*) the rape in episode 6 left a bad taste in my mouth, especially the fact that it went completely unacknowledged. regardless of simon's lies, daphne was absolutely in the wrong, and yet daphne is made out to be the victim and simon is forced to apologize and give her what she wants anyway. i absolutely despise daphne and i couldn't root for them after that, no matter how badly i want them to be together in the beginning.",5
North America,"I agree that it's totally ok to rewrite history with diversity. I also have no preset notion of whether it was true to the books, but the writing and directing make this feel like a C level Hallmark movie. I don't blame the actors but, the director has purposely gone for what is a very ""presentational"" style of acting. Like on a sitcom. Each piece of dialogue is performed almost ""to camera"" as if each actor is doing a monologue. Their movements are really big, like theatrical plays and this removes any emotional resonance OR historical accuracy for me. Having been addicted to British period dramas for years, it's the tightness, the emotional understatement of people in society at that time and the characters desperate to break out of it. That's what's compelling to me. This has none of that which, to me, is the ONLY thing that makes it fall short of its status as a historical drama.I'm super sad this didn't work out. Super, super sad. I think Shonda Rimes is a genius and I absolutely crave seeing talented black actors. Just a shame. Glad it's a hit for Shonda and company, because it flips the finger at all the white male executives who have throttled ideas like this for decades.",4
North America,"Well this TV series really turned on my tears, the plot twists kept me on edge and the gossip was amazing and historically King George Was losing his mind unfortunately, every family was struggling and no one had a perfect family. What an amazing diversity in the cast although this diversity did not exist in England it felt good that it existed here in this series.",10
North America,"I have not read the book, so am new to this story. Loved the characters, the diversity, the romance, the strong female characters trying to assert themselves in a time when women were anything but independent. Romance, mystery, intrigue, real life messes, and good messages. Thoroughly enjoyed it.",9
North America,"If you have nothing to watch and are looking for some casual teenage heartthrob trash TV this is it. The only surprise is, it's not set in a high-school but rather in the victorian era. The story had me cringing at every step with almost too frequent sex scenes. There is no villan or remotely likeable character, just a bunch of annoying people making absurd and nonsensical decisions and having sex while doing it.",1
North America,"If you are looking for historical accuracy this isn't for you.
If you are looking for a show with gorgeous costumes, sets, and a damn sexy leading man who happens to be black...this is a dream come true. The casting truly feels like ""right actor, dont care what their race is"".
The actors are perfectly cast, the chemistry between Simon and Daphne is strong, and the humor *just right*. Wonderful adaptation!FAQ:
Yes they ""explain"" why black people are in positions of power. No they do not focus on race, truly it is only mentioned 1x (maybe twice?) and never any talk about biracial couples. In this world people are just people.Yes there is sex. A lot of it. Dont watch with your mom if you aren't comfortable seeing sex scenes--lots of naked male butts, some boobs, thrusting and seeing a man go down on a woman. It's intense for like, 5min montage and a little bit at the start of episode 1.Yes there are major changes from the book. They don't lose any of the important pieces and the changes make sense for a TV show-- new characters help move the plot forward and new story lines flesh out the siblings we didnt get to know in book 1. Approach this show like a fan's retelling of the story and you can enjoy it.Can't wait for season 2!",9
North America,It is simple if you wanna escape the harsh world we in it even if it is as temporary and short as 8 hours it will do the job and do it perfectly.,10
North America,"I have not read the book. It's a fantasy novel, OK. I have no problem with the cast diversity - it's the sole redeeming feature. I just can't understand why anyone would make such crap. Why engage such a talented crew to produce rubbish like this?",1
North America,"Simon and Daphne's relationship was very sweet. In some places the drama repeated itself, it was a bit boring but in general I had fun and liked it",8
North America,"I am shocked and saddened to hear the other reviews, because it has ""Africans in it."" Art is subjective, and movies and TV and be created in anyway. If you can't get past the diversity I'm sorry but you are the problem of the rest of us not moving forward in society. This is the stuff Prince Harry and Megan Markle are trying to change. This show has great harmony, great acting, the Cinematography, and music selection very good. Costumes are exquisite as well. This piece really shows at the end of the day being diverse we still have gender issues in society, but it also shows that we can progress. I find this show charming makes you yearn for more and give at shot! Please give it a shot wiht out I'll judgement.",8
North America,Love this series. Im actually rationing the episodes to prolong the experience.,10
North America,Why those songs horrible dont suit at all dont they even have to pay for them. Useing an fifty shades resemblance not an smart move to use someone who already excist.But actors other hand were decent.Easily can watch this not painful.Dont know how they managed to get allmost hour long episode would have guessed like thirty minutes.,6
North America,"I will admit, I have not read the books, but that's okay because this isn't a book review. As for the television series, it was captivating! The sets, wardrobes, etc. were precise and obviously created with precision. The actors all hit their mark and played their roles exceptionally well. Just like any story, you learn to love and hate a few of the characters.The series was exciting to watch and I wanted more as soon as I finished the first episode! I wanted more love, more lies, more sex, more betrayal...all of it!For those reviewers upset about POC playing queens, dukes, and high-class individuals, get over yourselves...it's fiction for goodness sake. This isn't some biography or documentary.
Yes, the story does include historical elements; however, most viewers comprehend that what we are watching was soley meant for entertainment, and entertained we were!",8
North America,"I have not read the book series so I watched this with no expectations, and I thoroughly enjoyed it for what it was - entertainment! It is not a historical documentary and that's the beauty of it. It is historical FICTION for the modern audience; it is make believe - a world where there was racial diversity amongst the most elite in society (and it's all the better for it). I have absolutely no problem with switching off from the nightmare of 2020 and, instead, watching beautiful people (in beautiful costumes) entertain me for a while. It is definitely no Jane Austen or Brontë - but that's a good thing. Those are the classics and will always remain so. This is a lavish and modern spin on the genre. I thought that all the cast and crew did a fantastic job and I'm looking forward to more escapism with the next season.",10
North America,"So disappointing to see all of these bad reviews. Full disclosure, I have never read the books, but I can understand that some people may get attached to their personal idea of a character. However, I (and perhaps anyone else who has an imagination and loves when modern touches are added to periodic tv shows/movies - ie: The Knight's Tale) absolutely love it. The chemistry between Simon and Daphne is untouchable. Their storyline is heartfelt and lovely. I love all the characters, although some of their storylines are a tad bit boring but I imagine they will get better as the show continues.
I urge anyone with an open mind (and heart) to give this stunning show a chance.",10
North America,Loved this show so much. Great to see a diverse cast executing the script with wit and brilliant acting. Highly recommended. Those complaining about the cast's diversity are showing how racist the world still is. Sad.,10
North America,"I'm really in much more love with the series. Is very inclusive to all the races and the chances were better for the ""tv formats"". Hopefully we'll have asians on the royalty soon too",8
North America,"I've never read the books, but I was really enjoying the series as a whole until Daphne basically rapes Simon in episode 6 and the remaining episodes obviously have to deal with the fallout. I've since found out that something similar happens in the books, so it's accurate to the text, but it really turned me off from the rest of their arc in the series. I'd be interested in watching another season of the show, but primarily for the secondary characters in this season. I was immediately intrigued by Eloise Bridgerton, Benedict Bridgerton, Colin Bridgerton, and Penelope Featherington and, following episode 6, these characters, along with the sibling relationships and friendships between these characters, really carried the series for me.",7
North America,"Don't expect historical accuracy, just roll with it as a fantasy Regency world and you'll be entertained!I'm someone who can be irritated by the too obvious in your face wokeness and political correctness but in this case it didn't bother me at all. Yes there are people of colour playing it it. Does it matter to the story? NO.It's mainly a show about romance. There. If you don't want to watch something like it, just don't, but do not leave sour comments just because you don't like to see coloured people in a regency show or without having seen the whole thing. And btw in the theater coloured people have also been playing ""white"" roles and that has been accepted as normal.Okay I could write a whole essay about the issue above but I'll now give a review about the show itself. The showmakers don't claim to have made a historical accurate show. It is good they have done that because it really is modern. Maybe a tad too modern for my taste, but oh well they wanted to reach a wide enough audience...As a ""fan"" of the Bridgerton books I am happy with how they adapted the books. It's not entirely the same and it shouldn't be.There's not enough story in the books to carry a tv-show.You can tell a lot of work and care has gone into production design. The show looks great!I show was lighthearted with some heavy elements and for me the balance of this was just right.The main romance is executed well enough as you can expect from this genre.The acting itself is good, the actors did as well as they could've done!Jonathan Bailey playing Anthony Bridgerton is maybe for me the most outstanding role as he seems to have a more complex personality. A surprise to me was Ruby Barker playing Marina Thompson! She could acted her funny and heavy moments out with ease. And Nicola Coughlan as Penelope Featherington was also an eye-catcher for me. Her portrayal was spot on.However some elements of the show could've been fleshed out a bit better I suppose. But these kind of shows are almost always lacking a bit of depth.The show is great at what it tries to be so just enjoy it as it is! A solid 8 from me (I would've given it a 7.5)",7
North America,"While the ""queen married a dark skinned person and then created equality"" was a bit jarring at first, I got used to it and was enjoying the show at the beginning. Even with the Ariana Grande music played by orchestra. But then, there was a bizarre twist where the show turned into what was essentially porn. Every episode had minutes soon minutes of sex. The main character raped her husband... he was saying ""no, no, stop"" but she wanted to be pregnant so she forced him to continue. And this was portrayed as a good thing. This was one of several ""women, take your power, trick men"".Honestly, I never read the books. But this was not a good period drama. I love period dramas and this one was just bad. There premise had promise. But the execution was abysmal.",1
North America,"I didn't even know there was a series of books until I started reading the reviews and I do sympathize with those who are not happy with the adaptation... For me, it was fun, I like the characters and to be honest, it was refreshing to see a diverse cast on the screen. Yes, the costumes are gaudy and OTT but this isn't a documentary and was never meant to be. I disagree about the chemistry of the 2 main actors and find it very believable. Might want to look up Queen Charlotte's ancestry before throwing any more criticisms around about her appearance on the show. Was very interesting.",7
North America,My only complaint is the contortionist that performed for Queen Charlotte in one scene was wearing stiletto heels which weren't invented until about 1950!,8
North America,"The series, in my opinion, has more strengths than weaknesses, like the great costume and the perfect soundtrack, and the scenario wins over anyone, and the actors' choices would not change any, from my point of view, even the series being at the time, I see no reason not to choose black actors for the roles of royalty, since the stereotype that black actors can only play slaves or butlers, does not help in the fight against racism today. (my opinion)",10
North America,"I guess they tried to compensate the hollowness of it all with sex scenes, poor writers tend to do that when they cannot come up with anything else more enticing.
But even if we excuse the amount of sex scenes that add nothing to the plot and honestly even cheapen the show, the rest of the story is horrid.
They make a god awful attempt at portraying the struggles of being a woman back at that time, only to present a bunch of girls and women that actually have pretty good lives with no worries. Even Eloise, who tries to represent the need of women to take a different course, doesn't actually do a single thing for herself.
As to Daphne and Simon's relationship, i only have one thing to say: EWWW!Honestly, just a show about a bunch of rich people going to each other's houses and having no real concerns in life. Just the thought that this show is set during the Napoleonic Wars era, which gave way to Tolstoy's War and Peace, is an insult.",4
North America,"I thought it was just fantastic! I cried, smiled, danced, and fell in love. Definitely my favorite show of the year",10
North America,"Historical fantasy and period romance are a fantastic way to reimagine history. Episode 4 really hit me hard. It gives you the imagery you always wanted....costumes are fantastic....and then gives a depth I search for in reading romance books. Yeah I wasn't exactly sold on the main romance...mostly for the woe is me whining of the privileged couple madly in love. Luckily you have a whole cast and menagerie of storylines to follow and invest in. I can't wait to see what happens for these characters and I wholeheartedly love the boldness of saying WHAT IF we hadn't bound entire races of people in enslavement, social inferiority and servitude....where would we be today IF we had had an equality movement nearly a century earlier. Also the queen is a kicka*# character and I could watch her comedic performances all day...not to mention her turn for the drama",8
North America,"The show itself is quite boring, however I really like the colourful cast - at first it's strange, since it's a period drama, bet strangenesses goes away quickly. And then I am seeing just actors, not their colour.We shouldn't be surprised if we see a black royal. Maybe it's not historically accurate, but we shouldn't be thinking that ""royal could never be black"". This opens our minds - the history could have been different.If we always portray royalty as whites, servants as blacks - it would stay so for longer. In our heads and in reality.",7
North America,"This series is so freaking amazing. I got the feeling as if I were in this era all through the episodes, from the costumes to then characters, the love story and just everything about it. A MUST WATCH.",9
North America,"Is it historically accurate? No, is it ok to change history to suit THIS TIME, absolutely.
I don't get the absolute ignorance in all the comments. Color of the skin doesn't matter, the costumes and sceneries are beautiful, the dialogues funny, the story engaging. That's it.",10
North America,"What an unpleasant show. If I wanted to see sordid sex, ho hum costumes and bad acting I could watch any number of Netflix shows. I was shocked how bad this was! And really, if you don't want to present a period piece then perhaps pick a different project!",1
North America,"It's quite fun as long as you don't take it too seriously.
Do pay attention to the music at the parties/balls - Billie Eilish, Maroon 5, Shawn Mendes, Celeste, Taylor Swift, ...
A good distraction in these complicated times.",8
North America,"There are couple of wealthy families constantly having costume parties and trying to impress each other with their posh accents. To be fair i have no interest in 19th century British society life. Maybe that's why i found this so boring and pointless to watch. There are some jokes involved but i don't get it. Only good thing about this show is inclusivity of people from different backgrounds although it's historically not accurate for that day and age. I cannot say anything about acting of the actors and actresses as not sure if they were supposed to act bad. Anyways, it's over for me after 3 episodes...",3
North America,"This is series is so much fun! I absolutely adored it. I shared my enthusiasm about this series with my friends, and we've all raved about The Bridgertons. We can't wait to see which couple the writers will focus on next and tell their stories of scandals and romance. Praying for a second, third and fourth season to come!",10
North America,"This is a drama for the times ( 2020s) . The sets are amazing, stunningly so. The costumes well thought out. Queen Charlotte, the King's Wife ( George III) is interestingly Afro-Caribbean and her staff dressed in court dress of around 1750. Courts as we know, never move with the times.
The dialogue and themes are 21st century. Jane Austen is sufficiently replayed that one can watch that for authentic period dialogue
No one has four daughters ""coming out"" at one time. Each one came out in a different year and had to find a husband by the years end.
Lord Berborough visits ""at home"" without visiting cards. More shocking The Duke has no cravat at a society ball !
A servant wears his bicorn hat crossways - 'like a ship in full sail' coming towards you. The last person to do that was 25 y prior, one Horatio Nelson.
The more modern way was as the line that one walked.
At one At Home, the lady of the house converses with the visitor - who appears to visit without a manservant - whilst two daughters play cards and one a harp. The girls of course should be around the visitor listening to what she had to say
Excellent drama, and I recommend it to everyone. As for - did it ever happen once? No, it is a drama.",8
North America,"To those that say it's not historically accurate, a la the mixed cast, I say so what? It got me to imagining what an integrated world at the time might have meant for us now. It's ""Emily in Paris"" across the Channel at an earlier time and I loved Emily in Paris. The deeper you get into the story, the more enticing and fun it becomes. It goes without saying that the visuals are sumptuous but the script/plot are fine as well too. Highly recommended.",8
North America,"I am not one to review shows or any kind at all. But to be honest, I honestly do not think that people has given this show enough chances. While it may be unrealistic especially due to the diversity of the characters I do find it refreshing to have a show that is diverse.It's a fun, witty show that is NOT to be taken too seriously. With everything that has been going on in our reality this show definitely gets me out of it, even for just a moment. And that to me is enough to make this show a worthy to watch.",8
North America,"I have to admit that there are differences from the book series, but I am ok with that. As any one how has watched a movie or series based off a book knows it is never the same. That being said I enjoy most of the changes that they have made. I think that they add to the story. I am looking forward to see what happens with the rest of the series.",8
North America,"I enjoyed this series. Downton it isn't, but still watchable. Other reviewers have commented on casting but this is not historical fact - it is a STORY, a fiction that happens to be set in the early 19 th century. As such, characters can be whomever the author chooses. I'm looking forward to the next series.",9
North America,"...to my review, I just wanted to add that I wish I had a wisteria that bloomed for as long as the one on the Bridgerton house ??",9
North America,"It's the type of thing that you want to hope is a tongue in cheek parody, or a comedy, but it doesn't wink enough to let you know that it is, so the worry is it's a teen melodrama trying to take itself seriously.Not enough good bits from the book are in the show, nd some of the divergences fail to improve either.Don't mind a diverse cast in an unrealistic setting personally, but once that's done, by still keeping the pomp and circumstance, as well as the classism and sexism aspects all still in place makes it obviously jarring.The opportunity would have been to subvert all of that surely, once one of those fabrics was removed. Tell a new and different story more obviously tongue in cheek and more loosely based on the story.Is more similar to Reign (a dreadful, loosely historical teen drama but one that at least is self-knowing about that fact, and plays up to it), than other things that once they did one twist it could have been.Pride & Prejudice and Zombies, would have been a better inspiration, in how to set up the world building of non-accurate or loosely accurate history.",4
North America,"I have completed 3 episodes and think this show is delightful. I came here to see the reviews and am completely gobsmacked to see how many people are twisted up about historical inaccuracy and reducing the great casting of this show as merely an attempt to be PC. I am fairly certain this is a fictional story line and the beauty of fiction is the freedoms that it can allow. How wonderful to see a genre I love so much set in a wonderful place where no one bats an eyelash at race. There is intrigue, chemistry, humor, and conflict all set in a beautiful place with magnificent costumes. It is escapism. It is pure entertainment. Shed your stuffy, dated expectations and exclusivity and take a breath of fresh air. I cannot wait to finish this!",10
North America,"This series astonished me in every way and left me inspired, happy and full of emotions.
First of all to the diversity of the cast, because it is the first very obvious observation: It is not accurate of course, we all know that. But seeing another and better version of ""our history"" is a powerful thing, one that I felt and loved.
About the plot: It is basically ""gossip girl"" playing in the 19th century but with much less teenie drama and much more real emotions. The way the picture the sexuality of the characters is truly new to me and as much as a fresh breath of air as the diverse casting.
I haven't read the books and I know it can be hard for screen adaptions to live up to one's expectations. I can't comment on that. But without having read the books, this ist a truly new, strange and inspiring series with a great love story I would recommend to all my friends.",10
North America,"Bridgeton is at the same time historically inaccurate, and accurate as my title shows, but only if you place it in our universe. It is a reimagined 19th century England, or should I say even better it is as an alternative history of our universe. Bridgeton represents what could have been if black and Asian people were part of high society. It is Shonda Rhimes production and you ought to expect good drama, great acting, great music, brightness from the get-go, the costumes, and smart writing. Some will say is woke and politically correct, and if I followed those reviews I wouldn't have watched this delight. It has woke elements but surprisingly is very subtle, not out there and in your face. If you pass through the historical inaccuracies you will realize how everything matches from the actors to the acting to the overall story.
Now what I meant by my title is this, it is historically inaccurate in the representation of minorities as part of high society, somewhat the liberties of some characters in public which would have never happened in Regency era, the portrayal of the queen as a dweller in narcotics, etc. But it is accurate in the shapes of the costumes with a fantasy feel of it, the way they talked the balls the events everything else. The creator of this show presents what our world could have looked if racism didn't exist if all women and men were equal and society see them based on their standing rather than their color. It's a perfect world but also there are some imperfections in this world that reflect ours. I don't wanna dwell in the story, but it is a must-watch once you pass through the historical inaccuracy and take this either as a reimagining of our world or simply the alternative universe to ours , and you will enjoy it and you will ask for more, I mean its Shonda Rhimes and Shonda doesn't create garbage. I am against everything that feels forced, with hidden agendas like most of the moves and tv shows these days but trusts me this is not that kind of show, this is a show that entertains you as all shows must be, it provides an escape from the real world if only for a moment and you will definitely enjoy it.",10
North America,I really support the choice for a more diverse cast. Fiction is a door another worlds that mind can create.I,10
North America,"I did not have the pleasure of meeting the related queen bee in words,
Although the series is not void of lovely sentences, with true literary value,on the contrary I very much appreciate the opportunity of hearing those words, thoughts, dialogue, and the mastery of the narrator.
Love scenes were ""normal"" , as I, usually, in many cases, facing abnormal fabricated behavior fast forward them... these passed as those real life has presented me, considering the epoch. So it is a positive experience of good takes, dialogues, art.
Stories as this are the fabric of a type of literature that transcends genres.
Beeing able to bring it to screen and take an old, experienced viewer and critic to its happy tears, falling slowly off his cheek, more than the sad little tears that real man also drop, was an unexpected pleasure.
Drama, adversity, naiveté, social constraints, love and pain, ilusion and delusion, what more to that stuff that dreams are made of?
I see clearly a good thing to say about Bridgeton,
Congratulations for bring us an object of that world called good cinema ou TV, in an age where we see the intersection of them both.
Congratulations for not spending my time with monetization and infantile attempts to shock and held the tent of a circus, as many unfortunate do.
Good ensemble.
Say different, I have my delusions filled already with some absurd criticism I was presented here in Imdb, here and there.
You are wrong. This is good work. Art.",5
North America,"People trashing this show are just mad because it's not identical to the books... This show was actually good, the actors were phenomenal and I was captivated from beginning to end. Enjoy the Shonda magic... if you haven't read the books, read them... they are great but this show is good too. Surely I can't be the only one who understands the meaning of the word 'adaptation'? Surely people don't believe a series is going to be word for word as the books??",10
North America,"Such an easy watch
The costumes are amazing
The acting is interesting in parts... Hastings is simply delightful",10
North America,I watched the entire season in one day. hope season 2 will follow,9
North America,Coming from a woman's point of view this show is very captivating to a little girl who is trying to find herself in a man's world. This show gives hope to us women whom are stuck in a life that we seem trapped. It is a brilliant well put together and I hope the director is ready to put out an amazing scandalous second season.,10
North America,Amazin how It looks like reading the books! So much loved!,10
North America,Daphne is cute but not the beauty she should be. She would not bring everything to a stop when she entered a room.,7
North America,"Unbelievable plots, poorly written dialogue. A great disappointment.",1
North America,"I have not read the book and knew nothing about it and I was not sure I would even like the series since I'm not really into romantic series/movies but I gave it a chance after seeing the trailer and from episode one I couldn't stop watching. I loved everything about it, the characters, the music, the clothing, the story. It made me both smile and cry at times. Eloise is my absolute favourite character. I can't wait for season 2.
I don't get the criticism about it not being historically accurate, for me it was just a story, in an alternative universe if you want. I once read a book with similar era describes but it was set in the future on another planet with aliens. Stories are stories. I'm not sure I would even like it if it was historically accurate. Watch it for what it is, a made up story. If you like romantic drama you will probably enjoy it.",8
North America,"They attempt to show society as it would be if it were free of bias and encouraging female empowerment. It is an exercise to show that racial inclusion would not be offensive or lead to societal breakdown. With all the complaints, the experiment has failed for some. I personally enjoyed it immensely.",10
North America,"I see a lot of complaints about the acting but I think they did the best they could with the material they were given. The story is predictable and the characters are shallow and saccharine. I'm halfway through and I'm really unable to care what happens to any of them.There's plenty besides the diversity to indicate this isn't trying to be a true period piece. You have people who've never met doing outrageous choreographed dancing, truly bizarre music for the period, and side characters who must dress and act ridiculous. Two guys beat the crap out of each other for five minutes without a scratch? OK...but whimsy can't make up for the insipid script.I give it a few stars because it isn't completely unwatchable, and probably fun for teenage girls.",3
North America,"Beautiful set and costume design. I've not read the book(s) so my review doesn't carry that baggage. I like the diverse casting; no need to see Whitey McWhiteypants having all the fun. The feminist honking is a little over-the-top. Hard to listen to the 1%, male or female, whining so loudly. Worth watching, but have a phone on hand to distract during the cringe moments.",8
North America,"I usually like these kind of period productions, but this was an awful mess. Just silly and not entertaining. I wanted to like it. But no.",2
North America,"That was an enjoyable watch. Well acted, good storyline and undeniable chemistry between the Daphne and Simon. Bring on season 2!",9
North America,"This show is great, from start to finish I was hooked, as was everyone else I know. There is a brilliant display of diversity and it is nice to see actors/actresses, many of them, at the beginning of their career. It has the brilliance of being adult enough to show the 'taboo' of regular period dramas, but does so in a way that allows romance and escapism. Sure people may say there is little historical correctness but the bigger picture is that it is a beautiful series. Does it have some flaws? Perhaps. Every brilliant show does. But I thought it to be amazing and I cannot wait to see Season 2.
Also one word... SIMON.",10
North America,"I was interested at first, but I guess I just don't think there's any chemistry between the main two characters.... it started to get boring and ridiculous at the same time.... like the things standing in the way of happiness were so stupid and contrived.",7
North America,Like watching a high school play. No historical accuracy horrific acting. What a waste of time,1
North America,"I haven't enjoyed watching a show this much in YEARS. It has all of the ingredients of a great show: romantic, elegant, fun, sexy, great script and perfect casting, amazing music, luscious sets and costumes, beautiful, sweeping visuals. While Bridgerton is the first in its genre to veer sharply into steamy territory, it doesn't feel cheap thanks to talented actors and a strong plot. The use of modern songs performed by a string quartet is simply genius, and the music feels like a truly important component. There's an element of mystery with the identity of Lady Whistledown, which makes it great fun. I also admire what they did with the diverse cast. It's not meant to be historically accurate, but an imagined (and better) world. Cannot wait for season 2.",10
North America,"So many colourful characters and scenery to take in. It comes across as less of a tv series and more of a theatre production, which is BRILLIANT. I also loved the subtle nods to fairy tale characters (think Cinderella, ugly step sisters). A visually beautiful show to watch, but the chemistry between Basset and Daphne is believable, and you really want them to succeed. Suspend any uppity notions of how a ""proper"" regency era drama should be done, and think more along the lines of the incredibly successful Broadway show, Hamilton. Have fun!",9
North America,"Very captivating! I'm quite enjoying this series! Great acting, great story lines. Definitely worth watching!",10
North America,"The prince gives Daphne an extravagant jeweled necklace, which she wears to the ball where the prince is expected to propose (episode 4?). Before he can pop the question, Daphne runs outside. She rips off the necklace and places it on the garden wall.A new scandal? Someone finds the necklace and reports back to the queen? Blackmails Daphne to get it back? Absconds with it and Daphne is desperate to find it to return it to her rejected suitor? Nope. None of the above. It just disappears and is never mentioned again.",8
North America,"Oh dear so many awful reviews. I wondered if i had moved into the twighlight zone.This is set in Regency times. King George III who now historians believe may have been suffering with Porphria. A bored queen Charlotte who filled her sad days with games manipulating her royal subjects. It wasnt until part way in I realised she was being played by a black actress. I thought she was amazing actually her face said it all. She obviously loved her husband but had no idea how to deal with his madness and everytime she could she should visit him in more lucid moments. It must have been quite hard for her to deal with.Then she meets the beautiful and flawless Daphne Bridgerton. It was then I was slowly introduced to the family. Daphne an innocent who was meeting the Queen on her coming out. With comments of the queen one would expect Daphne to have a queue of suitors, well she did sort of but sadly her over proective brother ruined that for her.The story is slow unfolding we get to meet all the main characters, and their stories enrwine within the story. We get to meet the family the Bridgertons i loved the mother, and Eloise too, and the eldester brother who was lost as he just had no idea how to run a family and was besotted with an opera singer. Benedict Bridgerton bored of society who slipped quietly into the unknown world of gay, and orgies and arists. Colin a quiet young man kind.then we met The Duke and i fell in love lol. We learnt of his terrible childhood, so bad it turned him away from love and family. His fathers cruelty he was only saved by the lovely but fierce Lady Danbury who i fell in love with such a wonderful character..I just loved the series never read the books. Its truly and epic love story. Whats all this WOKE business? I never noticed the characters ethnicity. If people dont think there were a mix race going on in Regency times well they need to get their heads out of he sand. The morality in that time was pretty non existant. Anythinig went, and Shonda Rimes used the right mix of it for me.I have recommended this to many of my friends who have now binged it and all LOVED IT. we cant wait for Season 2.Its full of intrigue, incest, homosexuality, you name it well its in there.As to queen charlotte several historians have said Charlotte was directly descended from a Black branch of the Portuguese royal family: Alfonso III and his concubine, Ouruana, a Black Moor.WATCH ENJOY.",10
North America,"This will not appeal to the average viewer of historical drama. This series is playing with culture and our assumptions about culture rather than portraying an accurate historical version of the time.The acting was fine, especially much of the supporting cast; the story a bit predictable; and while some of the script was nicely written, in other parts it was cringe-worthy.***Minor spoilers ahead.
I'm a fan of alternative history stories--they make me think, and question my assumptions. (I'm speaking of the Queen, wife to King George, being a PoC and the the possibilities this opens up for other PoCs.) Not that this was the focus of the story; it formed the background, and was mostly taken for granted rather than discussed. Other anachronisms included women being assertive, lots of modern-style swearing, and modern-Hollywood-style sex (both in quality and quantity).",7
North America,"Beautiful costumes, setting and story. No, I haven't read the book. The review is about the show. If you enjoy time period pieces with a twist and romance, you'll love this show. Just watch it!!",9
North America,This was definitely a show you could binge in one day and enjoy every moment of it!,10
North America,"Took me 15 minutes to conclude it was not a comedy, not to say it that I found it funny but it seemed so over the top that there was no way it was to be taken seriously. Well, it seems I was wrong. The acting seems relatively solid as is the costumes and the cinematography, unfortunately it does not work at all.",5
North America,"For the first half of episode 1, I was trying to figure out the diversity in casting of the Queen, Duke of Hastings and rest of the cast. However by the end of episode 1 I was hooked and had fallen in love with the story and acting. Quite different than the books, Bridgerton, the Neflix series has more influences of today - contemporary songs remade with orchestra pieces - that help set the tone and the mood of the story.
This is a smart and updated version of Bridgerton with lead characters who carry it off quite elegantly.
I am already waiting for season 2. I will admit I watched three episodes in a row and then picked it back up later in the day as soon as I had a chance.
If I would suggest anything it would be I that the show should have given the explanation of why the diverse cast works in the ""Bridgerton World"" from the beginning in the first episode instead of explaining it in later episodes.",8
North America,"Honestly, it's not that bad after a few glasses of wine. I enjoyed watching a period piece with a racially diverse cast. However, if you're going to get rid of racism why not also get rid of misogyny, bigotry, and classism?",3
North America,"I finished the show in one day. I saw it with my sister, we both liked the idea of the 1800s, I mean, who wouldn't want to live in those years? The Duke is simply so mysterious, which makes the show even better, because the more minutes you see from the show, the more you learn about him and his past. You have to see this show, it's one of my favorites and I'm sure you'll like it too!!!!!",10
North America,"As a viewer who didn't read the books I binged the show in one day. I enjoyed the characters, costumes and locations. Honestly a show doesn't have to be historically/racially correct to be entertaining. Watch it, it's good.",10
North America,It's the worst 19th century tv show. The show have nothing to do with how they talk and live in that century. I have read and watched a lot books and moves and tv show about that century and they have nothing do to with Bridgerton. It's a waist of time. I watch a the episodes only because I want to have a complete opinion and to find out what happen in the end.,1
North America,"I'm not really a big fan of period dramas, but I'm in love with the show!",9
North America,It was entertaining. If you're looking for an epic historically accurate piece then this isn't it and it doesn't pretend to be. It's just a modern love story with a Victorian era backdrop. It succeeds at being that. I think the leads did well and had solid chemistry although surprisingly the best couple to me was Anthony and Sienna. I enjoyed their scenes most of all. Everything between them was so intense. Their passion overshadowed the leads a bit for me. Those actors really delivered,7
North America,I've seen numerous book adaptations over the years and none have been so well done as Bridgerton. It follows Julia Quinn's books so closely while also adding some changes that seamlessly fit with the story. The cast is impeccable and the flow of events is perfect; not a moment of boredom. I look forward to many more seasons as we get to see the stories of each of the siblings.,10
North America,"I cannot believe some of the reviews I read ??
Especially the ones who says that it's not equally with the book. So what!!!!!
I just loved the whole show , the dresses , the houses , everything is over the top and I loved it all. I really hope the second part is coming very soon",10
North America,"Best love story, only got 1 more episode to watch, I'm totally in Love with it. Hope they making a second & more.
The only criticism I have is the ONE reference to racism, so far, It didn't need it. It just took you back to today's horrendous world. But apart from that it's a beautiful story. If only we could all live in a world like that.",10
North America,"Gossip Girl set in Regency England. Might be your thing or it might not. Personally I loved it. Just don't expect anything close to Austen- this is not in the least bit historically accurate but it's great fun if you appreciate it for what it is, gloriously trashy escapism.",9
North America,It's awful. I felt no emotional connection to the characters. Netflix adaptations are soo bad,1
North America,"This is not your mother's period drama piece.
This is so much more.Yes, the costumes are not historically accurate. Did that take away from the show? Maybe for you, but in the vein of Coppola's Marie Antoinette, it very much displayed the lavishness and possibility that period clothing could be more. The costume design team has made a masterpiece, it was a genuine pleasure to see such intricate and breathtaking pieces shown. From the Queen's court dress to Daphne's blue morning dress - they are beautiful, simply put.Yes, there are black aristocrats (aside from the main hero, portrayed by Regé-Jean Page) which is not entirely historically accurate. Does this change the character? His motivations? No, he's still Simon. Does the fact that there are black aristocrats get addressed? Yes, in a very moving speech from the (mind-blowingly perfect portrayal) of Lady Danbury (Adjoa Andoh).Yes, it's not family-friendly, in the traditional sense of the ratings system. Does this take away from the perfectly executed family scenes between the Bridgerton siblings? No, it does not. To quote Lady Violet Bridgerton (Ruth Gemmell) ""We like each other"", and that is something that is integral from the books and is now in the show.As someone who has watched many period pieces and suffered through the uncomfortable Mansfield Park (1999), these actors and actresses are worlds apart. It's fresh and dramatic and exactly what I would expect from the combined talents of Julia Quinn, Shanda Rimes, and Chris Van Dusen.While I'm just another fan, and one who has watched Pride and Prejudice (2005) one too many times, I can confidently say that this is my favorite period drama. Is it because it's newly released? Dramatic? A visual joy? No, because many other period pieces I could say the same for.It's because in every aspect of the show they have modernized the story, but in subtle ways that do not over-power the larger scope of the show. The excellent cinematography and set design, diversity in casting, scripting in a way that isn't right out of Austen, and the score. I could wax poetic and write another 400 words on the score and audio alone. Kris Bowers: you are so very talented and as my best friend as my witness, I had to pause and go on a ten minute excited rant about the track (that I now know and have downloaded) ""Simon and Lady Danbury"".At the end of the day, don't take my word for it. Form your own opinion. If it's not your cup of tea, then go get a juice box.",10
North America,"I think the intensity of the negative reviews comes from viewers who had read the book. As is typical for book loyalists, regardless of which adaptation, they are simply incapable of a fair review. IMO.
Likewise, Pride and Prejudice/Downton Abbey fans are going to be hard on this show. This series was never meant to be historically accurate. It was meant to be hyperbole.
I'm a big fan of Baz Luhrmann's style, and this reminded me so much of his movies. It's a cross between his Romeo and Juliet, or Moulin Rouge, and perhaps Sofia Coppola's Marie Antionette.
Simon is perfectly cast, and his intensity and commanding presence set the bar high for the rest. Eloise is a close second. She almost steals the show.
Ignore the naysayers, and give it a chance!",9
North America,"And that's for the gorgeous costumes. The series' writing is so bad it could be entered into a ""Write an awful parody in the style of Jane Austen.""",4
North America,Excellent period drama with wonderdully written intertwined stories. Watched it all in 2 days as it was utterly captivating!,10
North America,"Apart from the ""woke"" lenses through which this series is made, and which I have simply ignored, there is a certain unity of style that keeps one glued to the screen. Taken as a fairy tale for adults, it is most enjoyable, at least as long as you don't really take it seriously. Very witty dialogues, superb costumes and very sexy actors and actresses of all sexes, races and life-styles, if you pardon my French!",8
North America,"Bridgerton is a mediocre rendition of the domestic novels that established the likes of Jane Austen to the helm of fictional writing in the late 18th and 19th century. Women's obsession with marriage - marrying into a financially sound family - marks the primary theme of Bridgerton. Obviously the agencies available to women in the period were rare and a good marriage (sadly!) was what they considered as a secure retreat from the brutalities if the world. Bridgerton picks up this theme but fails to establish a connection with the viewers as the characters are largely mechanical and hammy too in parts. Their emotions are hardly palpable and some parts are so uncharacteristic of the era it's set in. The protagonist, Daphne Bridgerton, is no Elizabeth Bennett or Elinor Dashwood or Emma Woodhouse. She is one note and without actually caring for her the smooth/breezy screenplay just permits us to flow with her. You do not feel her awe or her joy or her troubles as you feel deeply how Elizabeth is in a dilemma - joy and shock - during her visit to Mr. Darcy's family estate, Pemberley.What salvages the show is that the narrative never bores. There's enough colour and celebrations and light hearted romance to keep you engaged through the running time. The show looks beautiful but we have seen better in ""Downtown Abbey"". The costumes though are at times just too eye popping instead of being eye pleasing. And who gave them the idea of playing ""Girls like you"" in the background for a show set in 1813 - it's such a put off.You may give it a try and flow with the tide but don't expect anything concrete. It's entertaining but fragile with emotions.",5
North America,This is more stupid than the stupidest stupid or even stupider.,1
North America,A historical fiction relying HEAVILY on the fiction.,1
North America,"Very good work this is a very good ,overall a good movie and we all like it",10
North America,"I've been up late for hours binge watching this show but I have to stop at episode 7 and have some sleep.
I love the characters and the diversity. If only life was really as accepting of everyone as it is in this show. At first I was confused and thought this is not how it was back then, it's hardly like it now sadly, but then I didn't care that it wasn't following with accuracy. I just loved the characters and their stories. Characters I thought I wouldn't like I do and characters I thought I would like I think are terrible self serving people.
I don't know the books, have never heard of it before so I went in with no expectations and so probably no disappointments. I would recommend this but I guess if you love the books you are probably going to be disappointed from what I've read from others.",8
North America,"1. I'm not interesting in idle gossip and backstabbing and this is HOUR upon HOUR of it.
2. The sex scenes are so cheesy and overdone and sometimes take up the entire episode.
I tried to watch but episode 7 was enough.
3. This show doesn't empower women. It shows them mostly as nothing but liars but also attacking one another, gossiping about one another, using sex as revenge ?! Doesn't seem very empowering or 2020.",3
North America,"This show is not only wildly inaccurate in its period depictions but also incredibly pretentious, distastefully raunchy and just all around trash entertainment.",2
North America,"It can hook you immediately, everything seems fitting , the setting , the acting , the direction. Just as it should be. Bringing out the perfect blend of 1980s nostalgia. It gives mixture of taste of big 80's movies.You immediately get hooked with the story , which is amazing because it takes time for me to get invested in a story.I have been a fan of David Harbour Since the Newsroom , and he is just amazing.You're scared , Intrigued , you're completely invested. With perfect setting.I am really looking forward to where this goes from here on in.",10
North America,"With its amazing 80s atmosphere and creepy X-files meets E.T feel this show is set to impress. Within its first 8 minutes of run time I could tell I had found something special here in Stranger Things.Its intriguing story gives information at a great pace and I never felt myself getting confused of bored and there were enough twists or turns to keep me interested. This also had some rather great horror sequences and their use of lights flickering while yes a common trope fit so well in to the story I was on the edge of my seat every time the crackle of electricity shot through my speakers and the lights flickered.The characters of the show are the true stars here, I loved every single one of them. They were all great with amazingly interesting flaws and the way they mix and clash with one another was fun to see unfold. They certainly help to carry this show although I would say that the government antagonists of the show felt a little flat and under developed and not nearly as memorable.Production values are also quite good with some beautiful cinematography, editing, lighting and sound. My goodness I loved their music choices. I would say that the CGI does look a little obvious and from time to time I did notice some issues where the scenes didn't look quite up to scratch. I do think however I've been spoiled for visual quality since Game of Thrones so I would take that criticism with a grain of salt because it certainly didn't detract from the overall experience. The setting and style of everything in the locations where also great to see and felt real and interesting. The way everything was shot also captures every moment expertly and really helps to draw out those story moments with greater emotion.Stranger Things is one of those special shows that I stumbled across and after the opening I knew I was hooked. Its exciting dark tale is expertly woven through its 8 episode run time and I know I will be back to re-watch this one. The ending is fairly well rapped up with a few loose story threads left hanging, with a promise for potential follow on seasons but the story is quite satisfyingly rapped up by the end. Memorable, exciting, dark and haunting Netflix knocks Stranger Things out of the park, 10/10.",9
North America,"Netflix does it again! I'll admit, I was excited for this show just based on the genre it was listed as being in and so far it has not disappointed. With the exception of a few of the adults most of the cast was unknown to me which only adds to the level of immersion the show can reach. The two performers I was familiar with, Winona Ryder and David Harbour are both magnificent. A few things about Stranger Things are extraordinary and could only be done by Netflix. One, this show is suspenseful and engaging so waiting for a week to see the next episode would change the entire dynamic and would really be a bummer, Stranger Things must be binged! Second, the creators of this series are, like the young actors, unknown to me. Matt and Ross Duffer. Brothers that through conventional methods may not have had the opportunity to bring this show to life, get that opportunity from Netflix. In the past few years television has changed wildly. If you were a writer or actor five years ago you would much rather be a movie star than a television star, those distinctions have all but vanished. This change was brought on by many factors but I'd like to take this opportunity to applaud Netflix for their role. It is no coincidence that they started doing their own programming right around the same time these changes began. Bravo and please start filming season two of Stranger Things ASAP!",10
North America,"Right from the beginning it's obviously set in the 80s. My first thought was E.T. for some reason. Aliens also came to mind. I have yet to continue the season but so far, it's a good choice if you're an 80s retro fan. I gave a 6/10 but that may change. The other episodes will determine my rate changes. Winona Ryder so far is likable as a mother. There were some strange things happening alright. I guess by continuing you'll come across stranger things. Law enforcement is introduced with their typical Monday morning mood. The Chief of police is introduced as a conceited figure of authority, an attitude I'm sure many have seen in resemblance to other films or programs set in the same era. It should make for an interesting plot.",6
North America,"Just finished binge watching the entire first season. Not a bad show and entertaining enough.Chuck Carrie, Poltergeist, Stand by me, The Goonies, E.T. and a touch of Resident Evil into a blender and you end up with something like this show.They done a great job in creating a show that feels like a genuine 80's blockbuster including Synthesiser Score and all.The acting and script are great and you will actually care about the characters.The first 4 episodes are a little slow but never boring.Not much re-watch value but an entertaining show none the less.",8
North America,"What can I say Netflix has done it again!I was hooked from the first episode!The acting in this is brilliant, especially from the younger members of the cast.The period it is set in they have managed to get it spot on down to the littlest details.I especially like the musical score in it, sets the mood superbly!This series has the perfect amount of mystery, suspense, and scares to keep you wanting more!! Hope this show runs for many more episodes, it's a classic in my eyes!",9
North America,"Firstly, I feel I need to give you a disclaimer and tell you that I'm a big fan of most of Spielberg movies, so I could be biased. JJ Abrams' Super8 didn't blow me away and this definitely has the same DNA, and this is really good. The story, the soundtrack to the amazing child actors, all so good, especially Millie Bobby Brown who is incredible as Eleven. I must be hooked because I watched all the episodes in one go and I've got to go to work early tomorrow. All actors involved put in genre perfect performances, and it was nice seeing Winona Ryder in a major acting role again, although I think of Heathers whenever she's on screen, but that's just me. The only downside, if I had to choose one, is the monster effects aren't blockbuster movie quality, Hopefully, they'll be better in season 2 and it can't come soon enough. All credit to Netflix, they really seem to know what they're doing.",8
North America,"Stranger Things is the newest foray into Netflix's original programming, of which brings us their most impressive- and strange- production to date. When a young boy named Will Byers goes missing, his friends, mother and the town are thrust into a conspiracy involving a mysterious girl named Eleven and something even more sinister hiding in the woods of Hawkins, Indiana.From the get-go, you can tell this is an homage to classic '80s Spielberg, drawing on E.T. and Close Encounters, as well as JJ Abrams' Super 8. But, as the show progresses, it becomes more and more like a twisted Stephen King story set in a Spielberg movie. It becomes a dark and twisted ride into an even darker and more disturbing world where the stakes feel higher than anything before it.I can't go into great detail because spoiling even just a bit of the story takes away from the greater mystery, but I can say, it's one of the most thrilling and intense series to be on TV, without being on TV. If it were to continue, they have to pull the same punches they did with the first season, because they took a great many clichés, and somehow made them fresh and surprising, save for just a couple that they purposefully left cliché.",10
North America,"I've been trying to put my reaction to this series into cohesive sentences - even cohesive thoughts - and I just can't seem to do it. ""Stranger Things"" blended the best parts of some of the great 80's sci-fi films from ""E.T."" to ""Poltergeist"" to ""The Goonies"" to my all time favorite, ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind."" It was simply brilliant, and brings you back to a time when you were still able to feel a sense of wonder.Though there are plenty of thrilling moments, this film does not rely on heavy CGI or jump-scares. It focuses on relationships between parents and children, best friends, and even a touch of romance. It takes you on a journey from a parent's worst nightmare to the resilience of those who rely on friends and cling to hope.Also - you'll never look at Christmas lights the same way again.",8
North America,"It is a loving homage to everything great about eighties movies, but done in subtly enough way as to not be off putting. There are smart kids, young love, bike chases, flickering lights, 'suits,' and amazing creature work. Is there really much more that you could ask for?There are converging story lines, flawed yet relatable characters, and so much more.This show held up better than I ever could have expected.I have so much more I could say but this is a circumstance where going in blind will make your experience that much better, so I'll hold my tongue.Don't read any reviews, don't watch any trailers, just go watch it. The first eight minutes will win you over.",10
North America,"Wow what a unexpected blast this series is. Im steel stunned and wandering what a heck did i just watched?! Acting, camera, music, drama, mystery everything right on the spot. This series is a real jewel i want go into spoilers and all im gonna say is you gotta watch this. Of course we have seen things like this before but not in this unique and original way. 80s settings is done perfect. I was thinking at first this is some kids goonies like series but boy i was wrong. What should i say more than judging from the first episode looks like i have new favorite. I keep my fingers crossed and hope other episodes want spoil perfect atmosphere and settings. Im just wandering who has given this series less than 10. What would you expect more? Just Be sure you don't let your kids watch this ;)",10
North America,"An amazing nostalgia driven story, but also mysteriously thought provoking and scary. Stranger Things gives us a mash up of several cult hits like, The Goonies, IT, and ET. The show always seems to end an episode by sinking its claws a little deeper each time and really has you caring for these characters by the end.IE(Hop). Winona Ryder returns in great form and delivers a great performance. Her range of emotions of a grief stricken and angry mother shines through. David Harbour also shines as his character, but I think the real shining performance was those of the four main kids, who are all great and feel genuinely real of time period.(80's) Great fun and well recommended. Netflix keeps knocking it out the park with great intriguing stories.",9
North America,"Now I am only into the second episode, and just can't see why this has a rating of 9.3. But I do get that things may still pick up and blow me away like the high ratings it has! Although I doubt it, sure it reminds me of films and series from the past, but take those facts away and you are left with kids TV, with a few cheap thrills mixed in.Now I am sure my review up to episode 2 will receive many thumbs down, but if you are an adult and measure films and series from the past against the high score of 9.3 of this so far, you can't be serious.It is a kids show, nothing more, and borrows a story line from lots of other previous films and series, and that's it so far, and just can't see why it has this high score.I will give this a 5, and will change it after another episode or 2, that's if I can last that long.5 out of 10 at episode 2.I have made it to the end of the 3rd episode, but that's it, it is just way to boring for my liking, and looks like it just borrows bits from films and series from the past. I will put this into some realistic perspective, as it sits now it has a rating sitting at that very questionable score of 9.3, let me just remind people that vote for this, the number 1 and number 2 spot of highest rated films on IMDb ever, both have a rating of 9.2! How can dribble TV like this be rated so high? Either the world has gone mad, or the ratings on here are just bogus.Now don't get me wrong, I have seen far worse than this show, but have seen far better as well, it is glossy to look at, but it seems to be purely made for teenagers. And comparing it to classics from the past as in films and series is an insult, plain and simple.I can only give this a 1 out of 10, and please keep voting my review down, as it only proves how bad this really is.",1
North America,"Enjoyable is how I would describe this. Really loved the premise, the actors, and how well-made and polished this looks. Binge-watched it in a day. This is one of those things that you cannot let go once you have started watching, and even when the 8 episodes(totaling almost to 8 hours)do end, you wish it could be longer. I am already looking forward to the next season(Please Netflix, say you are too!)! So, all those sci-fi crazed fans like me, go ahead and watch this. There is an overall shroud of mystery that fits the story-line. The town of Hawkins, with its rain-drenched roads, and dark forests, is tailor-made to host the finale which will leave you wanting for more! Happy binging folks!",9
North America,"ATTENTION TO ALL OF YOU WHO LIVED YOU'RE YOUTH IN YEARS 80, liked movies like Goonies, Portergeist, The Evil Dead, The Thing, Alien(s), Star Wars, ET, Clouse Encounters of the Third Degree, Indiana Jones, It - Stephen King, Lord of the Rings (ok, this is newer, but the books are older and the references are all there) and so many other fantastic and unbeatable classics of that magic decade. I have to say: Watch THIS, STRANGER THINGS! Oh really. Watch it. But watch accordingly: at night, turn off your mobile, whats-app, Facebook, Instagram, blah blah blah, watch as you should watch every movie, with immersion, transport yourself into the adventure, and I assure you, you will remember how it used to be, when going to the movies itself was already an adventure. You will be transported to the 80's. Cool characters, family dramas, pure and sincere friendships among nerd, intelligent, and excluded children, teenage's dramas, music and soundtrack of the 80s, in every detail, from the suspense in songs of each scene, the opening song and title of the series, the soundtrack, the references/homage to the 80's is very strong, very clear. I loved it. For me, it is among the 2 best series I've seen in the last 10 years, with only Game of Thrones at the same level. I cannot think of any other that has given me so much pleasure to watch, which has given me the desire to watch again, and again, and again. No, not even Breaking Bad, Marvel's Daredevil, The Walking Dead, The Expanse (unknown by many, but i liked), NCIS, etc. I'm looking here at the list of series that I follow (around 50), and none is equal to the entertainment provided by this. Congratulations to the Duffer brothers. The series is amazing. Worth every minute.",10
North America,"Nicely paced show. The build up is a bit of a slow burn with great character development and an excellent cast. This is refreshing in that this series does not try to scare you every five minutes like a lot of things out now. The show, instead, exudes a subtle dark undercurrent dread and things unseen.If you were a kid in the 80's you will appreciate the choice of music, the clash and joy division tracks just seem to fit so well. Stranger Things gives off a Stephen King/Spielberg vibe from the get-go and is a love letter to the 80's. I'm not sure it breaks any new ground, but what it does, it does very well. The only thing I did not care for is that the ""bad guys"" are a bit one dimensional. The rest of the cast more than makes up for this shortcoming. Winona Ryder is great, the cast of kids, top notch. Netflix continues to crank out quality stuff.",8
North America,"Yes it's OK. Very dull until episode 4 when the story actually begins to become a little less predictable. The story is a blend of poltergeist meets underworld meets the goonies. Beautiful attention to details of the period but one can't help feel this attention has come at the expense of a consistent storyline. 011 is an excellent actress and deserves a huge amount of praise. We stuck with it until the end and it was enjoyable and I'm glad I watched it. However, it's once watched you probably wouldn't bother again. Its chewing gum for the eyes and sitting through it again would be akin to popping yesterday's gum back in. Still chewy enough to work your jaw but without any flavour.",5
North America,"Although it starts quite nice, it gets more awful by the minute. The dialogues appear as if spoken by the Teletubbies, everything is repeated at least twice. Winona Ryder (who used to be wonderful!) acts like a 70 year old lunatic witch with weird gestures and wide eyes, even the rest of the cast is screaming and yelling most of the time. The 3 main kids act completely over the top, including all those movements and slang kids use TODAY, but didn't in the 80s! The Natalia Dyer story line (please give her something to eat! She looks as if she is falling apart any time!) is schmaltzy beyond compare, and contains by far the stupidest acting. What is worst, there is probably not one original thought in the whole series, it is just one big mashup from Poltergeist to E.T., the Goonies, Indiana Jones' sidekick Short Round, even Minority Report. You name any other 80s' flick, it's there. But - and this is a huge big BUT - Millie Bobby Brown (Eleven) is absolutely amazing! Every gesture, every shy gaze rips your heart into pieces. She definitely deserves much better than this crap series.",1
North America,"I wasn't sure what to expect from Stranger Things because I don't really know anything about the source material. I've watched a few episodes (I'm trying to pace myself) but I can confidently say that I'm hooked, I've got to have more Stranger Things. These characters are wonderful and engrossing. Winona Ryder & David Harbour really do such a good job in this and I know working with very young actors must be challenging but these kids really bring it! I especially like how normal these characters look even though they are engrossed in such a surreal situation. This is what real sci-fi should be about. Netflix, I keep trying to find a reason to end my subscription with you but I just can't find a single one (smile!).",10
North America,"Imagine if the atmosphere of Twin Peaks had a child with Super 8's mystique and gave birth to Silent Hill's eerie quality with a hint of X-files's flavor - that's Stranger Things for you.There are so many things about it that are very unlike what you see on TV, due to more freedom given by Netflix. It's refreshing. It's suspenseful. It leaves you feeling like you're actually THERE and you're feeling EVERYTHING. It's really hard to describe. All I can say is that you really feel like you go into a whole new world when you watch this. Even though it has kids in it, I wouldn't call it a kids show at all and wouldn't recommend you let your younger children watch it, as it may disturb them. It's not particularly gory, but it's a psychological twister.If you like a good mystery with a dash of supernatural, you'll like this.",10
North America,"Breathtaking. Watched it in one sitting. It really feels like it would be originating in the 80's. Great Costume, Set Design, Soundtrack, Artwork, directing, photography and so on. When i watch movies out of the period the Show is set in, I always think how sad it is, that movies or TV shows aren't made like that anymore. So it was a real pleasure to see with how much love for detail the team reconstructed, not just the look but the whole feeling of an 80's movie. The child actors are great and, if they won't end up with a drug addiction, will have a great career. The last episode was basically an hour of crying. Netflix one again, shows how high the quality of their own productions is and how important they have become as one of the big players. Its definitely one of my favorite newcomers this year and I'm looking forward to the next season.",10
North America,"Just watched the first chapter last night. Everything about it is great, the actors, the writing, the fact that it takes place in the FREAKING 80s (YES!) and all the music. The theme music is completely on point...very John Carpenter-ish with heavy synthesizer sounds that are very menacing. Watch this show, tell your friends to watch. It feels very Stephen King/Steven Spielberg..with some X-Files mixed in. I have never seen the kid actors before but they were all so good. Their on screen chemistry reminded me of the group of friends from The Explorers, Stand By Me or The Goonies but it's definitely not lighthearted or a comedy at all. It's always a good sign that a show is going to be good when you are completely sucked in within the first couple minutes. 10 out of 10 so far.?",10
North America,Hi guys and gals!This series is the best in the genre (series/mystery) in a long time.And who delivers again...? You already know: Netflix. They hardly every miss on their exclusive content.The Duffer brothers made it big this time. I liked them from Wayward Pines excellent scripts.The casting is great!This series will be appreciated in by most from 10-88yo.For those like me who grew up in the 80s this series have a nostalgic vibe also. I won't spoil and don't go into details.I hope you enjoy it as much as i did!Have a great time in front of the screen of choice!Till next time!,9
North America,"Stranger Things is another very good offering from Netflix.. it certainly holds its own with the best in the horror genre on TV.. a stronger area than some would have us believe.. Walking Dead, American Horror, Penny Dreadful, Outcast.. strong performers all. As someone who grew up in the 80s the cultural references in this are off the charts.. you can see what they watched and read for inspiration, It, the Langoliers, ET... even Predator.. apart from some fairly obvious reasons heres a great one for fans of the Arnie classic... Jim Hopper saves Hawkins from the monster... My one minor complaint is that at a couple of points the cgi/green screen is a bit dodgy. The make up, sets, acting, direction and writing make up for it though and most of the visual FX are decent.. It is left for a season 2 if there will be one, but not to worry it's not left on a cliffhanger which is always a relief. All in all another great one for a binge session.",9
North America,"Super disappointed. Target audience has to be 8-14 years old. SO many things are unexplained that need to be explained. Huge plot holes and characters doing things that make absolutely no sense... constantly. What is even worse is that it is often the adult characters who do the stupidest things. Only a young audience could ignore it. Every time there is an intense scene of suspense the screen writer does something dumb to make you say ""Wtf?"" I will just say it... This TV series is really really stupid. There are also some adult centered themes that feel so out of place because most of the story is shown through 4 kids. Adult redemption and revelation themes are silly when 80% of the scenes are either 4 childhood friends or a high school couple. Add in some very shitty CGI to go with it and I am done.",7
North America,"The movie is really a mixture of clichés and ""borrowings"" from other series and movies, but somehow it's still enjoyable. I think, mostly due to the great cast and solid acting from the young actors. Visually, the shadows world is a blatant copy of the shadows world from Russian ""Night Watch"" movies. Some scenes have definite Spielberg movies inspiration. Throughout the series you will be like ""oh, I 've seen this already"" but you will, probably, continue to watch because who doesn't love well made old good sci-fi and, also, when the ""plump"" kid Dustin steals the show while on screen, your heart melts. All kids did great really. Winona's role was just too whiny and poorly developed for my liking. In ""youth"" category I really liked Joe Kerry. Though the main villain in the movie is the ""government agency"", I still think Dr Martin character was too sketchy and I did not quite catch what exactly those experiments were about.",7
North America,a kid with telepathy and telekinesis powers has a bleeding nose every time after she uses her power. checka science teacher / scientist explains how to bend space and time using a paper and a pen and pushing the pen through the paper. checkparallel universes. checkdolphin like sounds making alien monsters. checkguy tries to shoot cans with a gun but fails then an unexpected woman with amazing marksman skills comes and shoots the targets. so cool! check.And everything else is so cliché about this show. And IMDb you are a huge liar because of your fake ratings.This pile of nonsense doesn't deserve anything more than a 6. But then again who would watch it if you had shown such a rating next to it right? You are in this for the money after all. This was the last time I use IMDb to decide whether something is worth watching or not.,6
North America,"At first I saw a lot of Spielburg in Stranger Things, then once I got a few episodes in I realized that it's actually inspired mostly by Stephen King stories. Stranger Things = Stephen King (get it?). The biggest contributors I've noticed are Stand By Me, Dead Zone, Creepshow and Firestarter.It's very well done, the visuals are great, the acting is good and the pace is brisk enough that it should keep most people interested. It does help if you're familiar with 80's thrillers because nostalgia is one of Stranger Thing's strengths.It's definitely weird, which is expected. I definitely see this show becoming a quick cult favorite.",9
North America,"I found the series very predictable. But, what was unpredictable was how good it felt, because the plot treatment was mesmerizing. The cinematography was playing mind games with the viewer and the editing completely helped to be involved in the show. The kids were believable and reminded us of why childhood was so important. The show made me feel like another character in the plot. All actors were just bada$$. The music was the favourite thing for me. Special mentions to the 2 newcomers. Great job! Netflix is on a roll and Shawn Levy, great project.Some pointers though: expecting better CGI next time. Winona was used lesser than I thought. She needed more screen time.",10
North America,"(I didn't include a synopsis because they're everywhere)When I first saw the trailer for this show a few weeks back, I immediately thought of R.L Stine and Stephen King. But also for some god forsaken reason I thought of Earth to Echo, so I was very conflicted on what my prior thoughts were. Without a doubt I came into this show very skeptical. As soon as I watched the first 10 minutes of episode 1, I knew I was in for a treat.The first thing that struck me as I was watching it was the direction. Straight from the get go, I felt as if I was watching a movie. From the amazing cinematography to the incredible set pieces, I honestly forgot I was watching a show until the hard cut to credits.The characters were something I was always on the fence with. I kept going back and fourth from saying ""Yeah man, good for you!"" and ""What the hell is wrong with you?"". It took me up until the third episode to really get conformable with the main cast and crew, but once I hit that point I began to adore all of them. Surprisingly my favorite character by the end was Nancy, the uptight older sister of Michael.The story is so genuine and so unique there is almost nothing I would change. Except one thing, the main antagonist. They never fully disclose their driving force to do what they do, and what their ultimate goal is. However that's not a huge issue, and hopefully they'll go more into it in season 2.Stranger Things was more than just a new show to binge on Netflix, it was an experience. I don't want that to sound like an excuse to watch it. This show was truly a great piece of art in the cinematography medium. I highly recommend this show to anyone who wants to be surprised.",9
North America,"Netflix delivers another amazing original series with Stranger Things. The show mixes science fiction, horror, adventure, mystery, and teenage romance while throwing in lighthearted comedy and a deeper emotional core. It hearkens back to the Spielberg films with an optimistic undertone and a small town 1980s setting. I enjoyed every episode and the momentum rises all the way to the last shot of the first season. I sincerely hope this show returns for another round.This Netflix series is just great, fun, entertaining, stunning special-effects, and a plot that will blow viewers away. The acting is wonderful and brings to life characters that are easy to root for. Plenty of laughs to be had throughout and each episode ends with a cliffhanger that makes this show incredibly bingeable.The show has plenty of intense scenes of horror and utilizes every moment of the eight episodes to push the story along. The Duffer Brothers have delivered a gem capitalizing on nostalgia and delivering a fun, yet complex plot. Anyone with a Netflix subscription should check this show out and I'll be shocked if you don't enjoy it.After season 2: Netflix's 80s tribute and sci-fi adventure returns with another great season of monsters, twists, and a charismatic cast. The film begins with a bizarre scene where a group of punks flee including Kali (Linnea Berthelsen) who shares a similar tattoo to Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown). Mike Wheeler (Finn Wolfhard) continues to reach out to Eleven over the radio but he never hears anything. Eleven is hiding out in a cabin with Jim Hopper (David Harbour), kept isolated from nearby Hawkins. Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) and Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin) are obsessed over a mysterious MadMax who continues to beat their high scores. Will Byers (Noah Schnapp) has some residual effects of staying in the upside down for so long and will warp into the other dimension to see a giant monster approaching. His mother Joyce (Winona Ryder) worries for her son and has started a new relationship with Bob (Sean Astin), a technology expert.Mike's older sister Nancy (Natalia Dyer) continues to try to learn more about her missing friend Barb, enlisting of Will's older brother Jonathan Byers (Charlie Heaton) much to the detriment of her relationship with Steve Harrington (Joe Keery). The new characters in town are Maxine (Sadie Sink) aka Max who has been beating Dustin's high scores and her bully of a stepbrother Billy (Dacre Montgomery). As the monster slowly creeps towards Will, stranger things happen around Hawkins even as Chief Hopper makes an arrangement with the Department of Energy's new project leader Dr. Sam Owens (Paul Reiser). Pumpkins patches are dying and the scientists continue to try to burn out the encroaching substance from the dimension hole. Halloween comes as the boys dress up as Ghostbusters. Jonathan is supposed to watch Will but he leaves to hang out with Nancy at a party where she has got obnoxiously drunk and fought with Steve.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",9
North America,"An extremely well written story of a group of young friends whose selfless altruism out thinks adults and lets their brilliance save the day. We spent our entire Saturday binge watching from beginning to end. The acting was masterful and the plot was unique. The only reason I didn't give it 10 stars was the regular, unwelcome diversions from the core story...why do writers think we like the tired device of the local adolescent sociopaths who harass the heroes? I could not grasp why the bullying scenes were necessary, because the core story had more than enough power to carry the series all the way through. Each relevant character evoked either our sympathy for their triumphs, or satisfaction when they earned justice. We cared about what happened to them - good writing.",9
North America,"This is real good! binged watched the 8 chapters. The only thing I found was the AV teacher roof on his house has dimensional shingles; not available in the 70tys or early 80tys. But I won't nitpick, the acting is good, the story keeps your attention. The story does have holes but everyone is not me and may not take notice. I will be watching for these new talented young actors. Set in a small town filled with nuclear family's living sheltered lives in Cul-de-sac neighborhoods. And of course you have your top secret Government agency conducting mind alternation experiments on young subjects with trails of misconception and cover ups. A chain smoking sheriff with a broken past. The so called creepy kid that works to support his Mom & little brother. And a gang of 11 ish boys with creative imaginations. This is a mishmash full of sci-fi a little bit of the best, X files,Fire starter,Alien, ET, The Goonies.",10
North America,"Quality Science Fiction and Horror stories are a rarity, but I've seen Stranger Things.The brilliant 80's style ""Tron"" music and electrifying title set the mood for this epic adventure. Reminiscent of iconic 80's films like The Goonies and ET, but with the sophistication only a modern series could deliver.High Production Value Visually Interesting Above average performances on the wholeGreat for binge watching under the covers on a cold and rainy night. Truly one for a night of Netflix and ""chillin"".",9
North America,"This is one of the most magical things I have ever had the fortune of viewing. I won't go into details about the narrative, which is build on classic sci-fi and horror concepts and it works. But what really makes this show excel is the little things. The casting is amazing - every single character, regardless of how small the part is, feels like a complete character, and the main cast delivers some powerful stuff all throughout the series. The production is spot on in it's portrayal of a small town in the 80's, and I have to assume that it is in part based on the creators own experiences and childhood, because everything feels real.The only thing that bothered me throughout the entire show was the incompetence of the government entities. I know and understand that this is a popular portrayal of the government in these types of stories and especially in the US is this a common sentiment. But it simply didn't seem believable that they would make some of the choices they did. Doesn't take a genius to see that they are doing a crummy job. But this is all in all a negligible detail, as it keeps the story moving.",10
North America,"*SPOILER ALERT* The overall story line was appealing. The acting ranged from GREAT on the part of Millie Brown and David Harbour, to YAWN on the part of Winona Ryder and Modine.The writers/producers did a great job of trying to make it look authentically 80's, which as WHY... (some asked this)there is so much cigarette smoking going on in it. Having lived through the 80's I can attest, pretty much everybody smoked.Where the story line takes a turn to the ridiculous is towards the end of Episode 5, when Nancy... a young teenage girl dressed in design jeans and clothes decides she will crawl into a dark, slimy, cramped tree trunk! Oh, and she does so AFTER abandoning the guy with a gun and her only other means of protection- a baseball bat! Sorry, NO SALE.Well, I've not finished the series yet, so I may be back to edit this; but for now this is my take on it.",7
North America,"Everyone has got the mix of movies this series combines or rip-offs. Winona Ryder does a great job and is totally believable but she is basically doing a female Richard Dreyfuss in Close Encounters. On the one hand, every role has a parallel in something you've seen before. On the other hand, you can't say that all the actors don't do good jobs or that the show isn't entertaining. Actually very entertaining. I guess the person who steals the show is the young girl who plays ""Eleven"" Millie Bobby Brown and Winona Ryder comes in second and Natalia Dyer is kind of fun to watch as well but nowhere near Ryder or Millie Bobby Brown. But Steven Spielberg and about 6 other directors and writers should have their names added to the credits. But, heh, it's TV. It's Netflix and it is good.",7
North America,"Have been binging on a lot of series on Netflix and when the first peeks of this series came out it felt this would be something with a difference. And it truly was. Being an Indian I may not be able to identify with the 80s nostalgia of Americans but it truly provides a sneak peek into the trends and events that have been smartly woven into the story line. The costumes, the sets, the demeanor, everything seems reminiscent of those times. Now throw in a great 80s background score and over that potboiler of a sci-fi horror thriller. That entire recipe comes out as a unstoppable unputdownable story line that makes you hold your own right until the end. The smart screenplay holds the entire act right from beginning to end. There seem no slip ups and never in the entire season one feels let down by the superb efforts of everyone. All the actors have given a sterling performance with no voids left to fill. Overall a truly well made genius and hoping for more seasons in the follow through.",10
North America,"E.T., Harry Potter, these are the stories that perfectly capture the essence of being kids on an epic adventure. With Stranger Things, there can now be a third story added to that short but illustrious list. You root for these kids, who are not the rude cookie-cutter kids so prevalent in movies today. They are smart and kind and I was with them every step of the way; and the adult cast was every bit as compelling. The story is suspenseful and even a little scary at times, but it is also laugh-out-loud funny. This charming series runs the gamut of emotions, delivering chills, heartbreaking moments, an incredible buddy story, adventure, terrific humor, and lots of twists and turns. These are eight episodes of perfection, as far as I am concerned, and I can't wait to see where this series goes! My only regret is that I watched them all and can never watch it, for the first time, again.",10
North America,"I admit, I was a bit skeptical during the first episode of this series, but nevertheless, this sci-fi gem began to shine brighter and brighter as the story progressed.Stellar performances by every actor from seasoned veterans, Winona Ryder (Joyce), David Harbour (Chief Hopper) and Matthew Modine (Dr. Brenner). However it was the younger actors who stole the show. Kudos to Caleb McLaughlin (Lucas), Noah Schnapp (Will), the lovable Gaten Matarazzo (Dustin) and my favorites; the very talented Finn Wolfhard (Mike) and Millie Bobby Brown (Eleven).I cried like a baby during the climatic *ending*. I groaned when I saw Natalia Dyer (Nancy) with Joe Keery (Steve) instead of Charlie Heaton (Jonathan) and now that I know there's a strong possibility of a sequel to Stranger Things, I am hoping this romance goes my way!Bravo to Netflix for delivering, yet again, a brilliant show worth my time.",10
North America,5 is generous. So surprised and a little horrified to see a rating much higher than six!! I was extremely excited to see Winona as the lead actress but was immediately turned off by her performance. I'm sorry to say it but annoying is the only way to describe it. A definite Super 8 rip off & not nearly as well done despite what other reviewers might say. I'm 4 episodes in with 4 more to go. It's a bit like torture but I will finish watching them. I can't seem to get invested in any of the characters. Mike is OK. I saw one foreign viewer/reviewer refer to it as a masterpiece. RIDICULOUS!! Definitely not! Get real people! X-Files is a 9-10 not this piece of junk!,5
North America,"Enough said. But since I have to write a review, I will say this series is NOT in the league of Game of Thrones, which IS worthy of the high 9 rating. Sorry to say, but it's pretty much every cheesy 80's sci-fi B/Horror movie wrapped in one, with equally cheesy Goonie-ish actors. I gave it a slightly above average rating for the acting ability of the Eleven..the other kids constant, loud bickering and cliché teenage love/angst was getting unbearable by the 5th episode with no reprieve in the episodes that follow... Ryder & Modine did a decent enough job. The only thing which really irked me with Ryder was the awful shaggy haircut she had.",5
North America,"Just finished binge watching it. I'm just in love with the setting, the universe they bring back to us. Did you ever wanted that E.T or Goonies went on for 8 hours??? This was it. Just top notch production top to bottom, easter eggs everywhere and many goodies to enjoy a fine piece of work. Characters are lovable an relatable. The story arch was clear and well designed even with twists like the redemption of the douche jock and the ""odd couple born from distress"" not ending up together, with a just enough open ending that probably will stay like that and that's fine (I won't complain if there's a second season, but these guys will probably end up getting some big franchise to write and direct like the Russo brothers did (What is it about brothers working together... Just Magnific. Even the Washowskis in some points)Obviously this doesn't reinvents the genre, but it was an excellent work from everybody involved in the production. You can feel the 80 's alive in this one and if you have little boys you can show them how it felt to be a kid back then, to be a child watching the world through TV and movies.And to the hipsters that think that this was an average series i tell them to go a write a soul for them. Because if you go and find these mediocre ""at best"" (as someone said) i feel really sorry for you and probably your family hates spending Christmas with you.I'm 37 years old and for 8 hours i was 7 again. And that's priceless for me.Just watch it. Really...",8
North America,"I won't write long, because it is my first review on IMDb. I've just finished watching Stranger Things. I am so agitated... I need more. Oh God, I need so more. I haven't watched so good series for a long time. Everything in it is perfect, even music. The girl who plays Eleven is perfect. I don't know if someone could play it better. Millie Bobby Brown did a great job and now her ""star gate"" is for sure open. Friendship between Mike, Dustin and Lucas is so believable and realistic. Like I was watching best friends on screen. Dustin! Dustin is such a great guy! Gaten Matarazzo did also great job. Oh Lord. I don't know what else should I write. I think that's it. Now I'm gonna lay down on my bed and think all Sunday about everything.This is the series of 2016.And YOU HAVE TO WATCH THIS.NOW.IMMEDIATELY.",10
North America,"I usually get bored with a series after the 4th or 5th episode, but Stranger Things kept me straight through to the end. If anyone remembers the first Phantasm, this will take you back to the thrill and excitement you had when you were a kid. First, the music track was spot on. I can't say enough about how they created a mood. The use of classic synths is what brought us back to the late 70's and early 80's. Nailed it! Story never became corny, even with a few corny kids. Added to the realism of how dorky we were at that age. Eleven, the main character, was brilliant acting. I cannot wait until the next series. I hope it is as fantastic as this one. I am sure it will be, if they keep the lineup. Fantastic job guys!",10
North America,"I thought it was wonderful. It reminded me of so many of my favorite things. Stephen King, Stephen Spielberg, The Goonies and on and on. other review's site other examples of how it took the reviewers back.It took the best pieces and parts from amazing outlets and spun it into an original masterpiece.It had action, it had romance, it had friendship and coming of age, it had horror, and conspiracy,it had sweetness, hope, failure, and triumph.I know people now a days try to outdo each other with who can find the most inaccuracies and plot holes, but just sit back and watch this like you sat back in the eighties as a significantly younger person who still found joy and wonder in the world and watch nerdy friends rise above their potential, watch the unlikely hero save everyone, watch young kids fall in love for the first time, watch a mother fight for her child no matter how crazy she looks, watch a sheriff find redemption, watch that horrifying monster that is somehow comforting because he represents every other monster you've ever seen, watch the bad guys lose.It didn't answer all the questions brought about through the season, and your not quite sure the bad guys are finished but I hope that's because they plan on bringing along a second season.Remember the pure magic of seeing a film for the first time before you discovered the internet and found out that everything was flawed and could see hundreds of people point out every tiny mistake? That's what this series was like for me. I was so enthralled I forgot to be rating and judging it and I just went along for the ride.",10
North America,"Well, i've never written a review here nor am I an expert at this genre but all day I have been thinking, by God, this was such an incredible series and experience. Captivating, creepy and fun sci-fi horror.. this is really groundbreaking for a debut by two brothers.The acting was so on-point as well as the set designs, story and action.The point that sticks with me most right now has to be one of the last scenes that mirrors most of what we are all thinking at the end. One month after this horror, the kids are playing their D&G game again, this time, they know to fireball monster out of experience and that it is, defeated. ""Woah, that's it?"" - exclaims one. ""The campaign was too short"" - cries another. ""It was 10 hours long"" - replies the game master ""It doesn't make any sense."" ""what about the lost knights?"" ""..and the proud princess?"" ""And those weird flowers in the cave?!"" ""I don't know, it's...."" And they are all interrupted.That is the genius of this series. It mirrors our thoughts right now. ""Just 8 episodes?"", ""What about the girl?"", What about the future? What about the cover-ups? Does everybody know?And you know, that is the genius of fantasy and the genius of the story writing. There it is, right there. It is a fantasy and it just... damn... works well when told in the most spectacular, impressive, engaging story and experience.Stranger Things absolutely nailed it.",10
North America,"This may contain spoilers.For some reason I expected a sci-fi series, not a horror one. I'm sure it wasn't just me - several of my friends who were excited about this show (and told me about it) clearly said sci-fi multiple times. We were wrong.""Stranger Things"" is a mediocre, uninteresting, seen-it-a-million-times (soft-ish) horror series that tries to ride on the back of 80's nostalgia by ripping off every 80's movie you can think of.Some reviewers compared this movie to E.T. and it is true - the cinematography strongly resembles Spielberg's work (not the quality or the story, mind you). Otherwise that comparison is very unfair: E.T. is an intelligent, charming, emotion-evoking sci-fi and none of that applies to this series. If you read comparisons to other 80's movies, they're probably partially correct because ""Stranger Things"" likely ripped those off, too.The movie is frequently dark to the point where you can hardly see anything on the screen, there's a lot of screeching and screaming and some killing and blood and there's a monster in it for some reason but I don't believe much is revealed about its back-story. What story is present is nonsensical and is simply reused from other horror stories. Nothing original here.Acting is mostly OK (the kids were over the top a few times; nothing too bad). I do feel sorry for Winona Ryder for acting in this - I haven't seen her in a role for a while but I recall her being a good actress (she was OK in this one) and I think she could do better.If you're a horror fan, you may rate it higher but over 9? No way - that would mean this is somehow in the company of ""The Shawshank Redemption"" or ""Schindler's List"". I think this series is about 3 out of 10.",2
North America,"What can I say?If you love E.T., The Goonies, Firestarter, IT, The Thing, and lived part of your life in the 80's, this show feels like a comfortably broken in boot. The look, feel, and style of this show will constantly hit you with nostalgia and that warm fuzzy feeling you get when everything in a house is a different shade of brown.It takes a BIG chunk of the stories of the above mentioned movies/books but combines them in a way that keeps things interesting without seeming TOO familiar or plagiarized (most of the time), the main exception being Eleven who is pretty much a copy paste of Charlene ""Charlie"" McGee from Steven King's book/movie Firestarter (with the addition of a few new powers).Well worth the 8 hour viewing time, can't wait for more, the next year is going to be a long one.",10
North America,"I grew up watching eighties' stuff like Goonies, Gremlins, E.T. and all of that stuff, and of course wonderful horror like Evil Dead, Nightmare on Elm Street the Thing and Jaws, and this series struck that nerve like a jackhammer. From the bikes, to the Dungeons and Dragons, the hair and basically everything. This show is basically a love letter to the spielbergian action movies for kids, and unlike other similar attempts, like Turbo Kid, it's not a parody.Also: great acting (especially the kids), superb casting, wonderful set design and dramaturgy. Easy 10/10 for me on this one, and praying for a season two. Rarely have I been able to watch seven episodes without a single break. More stuff like this Netflix.",10
North America,"New 80s is trending right now. However, this series offered a sense of nostalgia rarely felt in other movies and series such as this one.Character exploration is beautifully done, and most characters have idiosyncratic traits which makes them quite interesting. Each character's history also ties into the main story line perfectly, leaving few loose ends. The acting is on point with some strong performances and directing is brilliant in regards to the mood being created and the intricate details of the 80s era. Together they've certainly been able to create a wonderful and terrifying world with an original and fascinating story-line.This series features kids, teens and adults and I really feel as if they are there to offer that enhanced sense of nostalgia. I certainly doubt it was to appeal to younger kids which this series is obviously not directed towards. Most of us have lived through such experiences and ordeals, so it offers that sense of ubiquitous normalcy, but which is set against the backdrop of complete chaos which shatters that false sense of security, the perfect way to create a reality-disrupting nightmare.One of the few drawbacks was its predictability. I didn't even have to try to guess what would happen next, I just did. I might have enjoyed a few sleight of hand misdirection plot twists but this still really falls in line with classic 80s movies, so even that was welcomed here.and the soundtrack is just an absolute bonus.Which is why I gave this a 10/10, they couldn't have done it any better. I am certainly bias, being a huge fan of everything 80s, sci-fi, horror and new retro wave, but this is an absolutely memorable series that will stay with me for a very long time.",10
North America,"Hello viewers ,I stumbled across this series just going through trailers on youtube a days back, My taste is very different when it comes to watching movies or TV-series, Its the first episode if it impresses me or the first 20 minutes of the movie, then I go aheaad and watch it completely,I had been very fond of watching X-files during school-days, after that I didn't come across a series so engaging and fascinating as this, Seriously I must say , the whole team of this show has put in a mind- blowing effort to make it super thrilling with the added mysterical background music and the hair-raising environment.I give 10 out of 10 rating for making this show a reality!!",10
North America,"Wow, this show is amazing. It contains a perfect balance of everything you would ask for in a show.I love the fact that it feels like I'm watching an 80s classic.Each and every episode contains the quality of a blockbuster movie, the camera work is steady and just like a Spielberg movie, and the music and actors tie together everything.My favorite character is the sheriff. The costume design and and set look great, and not for a moment it feels like I'm watching a show.Great job to the directors!I don't have a single complaint for this show.",10
North America,"Netflix's newest monster mystery mini-series, Stranger Things, is a lovingly made homage to the kinds of 80's horror and adventure films that I loved as a kid. Combining John Carpenter, Steven Spielberg and Stephen King, the Duffer Brothers somehow create an entirely fresh feeling and unexpectedly engrossing sci-fi series. The highlight for me is the group of D+D loving misfit school friends (particularly the toothless Dustin) who are forced to get their act together, Goonies style, to deal with the disappearance of their friend Will Byers. There's plenty of comedy in these endearingly nerdy boys that contrasts brilliantly with the darker, supernatural elements of the show. Winona Ryder, too, stood out for me as the frazzled parent of the missing child, providing some very memorable moments. Can't recommend this highly enough.",9
North America,"Right at the beginning - is this a good show? Yes. Is this the best thing since sliced bread? No. I don't think that the show deserves so much praise as it gets. There's almost a pathological sense of nostalgia nowadays and I would ascribe a lot of the series success to it's setting in the 80's. The feeling of the ""good old days"" is so abundant in the audience that they'll swallow pretty much anything with the retro vibe and continue to ask for more. So, let's put off those nostalgia glasses and be realistic. The series deserves praise for the execution since it's good enough to keep you engaged and make you binge watch the whole season. On the other hand, so many things have already been seen in other movies/series that there's no sense of originality (at least for me). If you are a long term fan of the genre, there's almost nothing new to see here. But if you're a newcomer, this will be a nice initiation into this type of movies/series and hopefully it will encourage you to dig deeper and find all the other works that inspired this one. For the beginning start with the one I've put in the tittle. Happy hunting.",8
North America,"Very pleasant surprise. Netflix and Duffer bros pretty much nailed it.An elaborate and hard working homage to John Carpenter, Spielberg, Raimi, Stephen King and other horror-adventure masters of the 70's and 80's that also stands on it's own legs.While Stranger Things does lack sometimes finely timed emotional punch and doesn't go full escalation in some cases, it still blinds with quality. From atmosphere to music, nice story, good characters and damn fine actors, this Netflix show is a great viewing.I'm not going to spoil anything, story is interesting and if show's synopsis here is not enough for you, then you'll just have to check the show for yourself. It does play with some sci-fi/horror standards, sometimes diving in completely, sometimes defying them but almost always is treating it's story and legacy with respect.Yes, it is a bit of nostalgia-bate but it uses that as an advantage and not cheap gimmick, which I find important to make it more distinct from other projects that solely bank on cheap nostalgic tricks.I'm totally recommending it and hoping that we'll get Season 2 or something similar.",8
North America,"I loved this show ""Stranger Things'(no spoilers below).It was a real nostalgia trip, with some excellent and strong performances by many child actors as well as from Winona Ryder and the many adult veteran actors in its strong ensemble cast.Great suspense, a plot and narrative that moves quickly and likable characters that you can't help empathize with.There are also some dastardly villains and plenty off a$%^% holes to hate and many people in between - the characterization was spot on.I LOVED the setting. The nostalgia trip for the period is intoxicating, there's also some cool off-beat humour with the Goonies-like gang (who I find to be actually more likable than the kids in the Goonies).Their Camaraderie anchors the series - I did not regret staying up all night watching.As a former Dungeon Master myself (briefly), I could relate to the Dungeons & Dragons references, and I feel they used the motif well to accompany the plot and themes of the story.Would like to see a 2nd season.",10
North America,"This is a fantastic horror/comedy. I was so pleasantly surprised as I began watching this. It is funny, scary, dramatic, and heartwarming... Usually all in one scene.The story is really about relationships...The good and the bad ones. Every relationship in this series is complex to say the least. I've never seen something quite like it.The acting is super. The music always fitting. The production quality grade A.There is a gang of kids that reminded me of the Goonies...mischievous, fearless, hilarious, and totally adventurous.I won't say much about the plot, because I watched it blind and am so glad I did.",10
North America,"I ended up binge-watching the entire season - 4 episodes yesterday and 4 tonight - like so many others!! I thought it was excellent! I'm not even a huge ""80's"" era fan, but this show managed to find the very best of that decade and bring it to positive light. The homage to the films and writers was so well done and the music was amazing! Parts of the show reminded me of ""The Goonies"" and ""Stand By Me"" as well. After I watched the entire season, I realized I was thoroughly entertained and without a single scene of gratuitous violence or sex, something that much of today's programming relies on vs. back in the 80's or earlier. I found it refreshing and yes it's something a family can actually watch together (although very young children might be frightened by the monster). The only reason I did not rate this show a 10 is I thought Ryder's character was a bit too much at times. The constant hysterics wore me out for the first half of the season but it did get better in the second half. I understand she was a panicked mother so I can't put a finger on it. I just found Joyce a little annoying. I'm not sure if that was an acting or writing flaw so I will leave it at that. That was minor though and I still would recommend this show wholeheartedly!! I hope they bring it back for more season(s)!",9
North America,"The Duffer Brothers are master chefs. I picture them around a stove arrayed with pots.""Let's add a dash of 'The Goonies', sprinkle in some 'Stand By Me', a generous cupful of 'E.T.', a spritz of 'Poltergeist' and garnish with 'Tron'.""They expertly captured the essence of 80's movies while at the same time telling a suspenseful and thrilling story. I excitedly watched episode after episode and felt satisfied after each viewing. Nothing went to waste. Each character was fully explored, each plot line fully developed, and in the end I felt more satisfied than when I binged on too much Christmas turkey and lay half comatose under the tree playing Space Invaders on the green shag carpet of my family room floor.Whoever the Duffer Brothers are, I wish to convey my heartfelt appreciation for this AMAZING show.P.S. The casting and acting were spot ON! Eleven, Mike, Dustin, and Lucas stole the show.",10
North America,"I will actually give this show a overall 5.5 or 7 in some good scenes but I see a lot of crazy people gave 10 stars? Are you fuking crazy? So I have to give it a 2 to trying to make it reflect the true star worthy!This TV series is so boring so slow and so messy, the ending scene clearly is an after thought for season 2! The plot has too many unclear things, it's just too much flaw...The casting is very on point, most of the actors are quite good but maybe the casting is so on piont it becomes very stereotype and cliché!I don't see why people go crazy for this tbh! I only watch it because I was bored",2
North America,"All the previous reviews have said it all: Great, constant '80s nostalgia references, great fun but at the same time truly troubling and terrifying, great acting and storytelling.Yeah, the first episode overdoes the '80s allusions a little, and the Chief is a little over the top as a dorky wastrel, and the kids can be a little TOO kid-ish, but still you have to watch the second episode, and by then you're hooked, and the binge is on.Great, engrossing fun all the way, constant action, some great acting, especially from Winona Ryder, tender-hearted, wise, and doesn't talk down to the audience. Btw, the first binge for my wife and me--we just couldn't stop!",10
North America,"I have seen a lot of new shows make their debut on network TV, Premium Cable, and of course streaming services like Amazon and Netflix. But this... Phenomenal show, imo best new show of 2016. The whole cast is excellent but Winona Ryder as Joyce Byers deserves Emmy Award consideration next year. Her being a Hollywood actress i expected great but this was masterclass character work. Winona has had some exception performances over two decades but this was one of the best of her career, maybe top 5 in her career. Also the performance from child actress Millie Brown as El aka Eleven is also amazing and is the 2nd best performance behind Ryder. This isn't the first show of this current generation to try and capture a artistic, creepy, and psychological noir style of an 80's film vibe... but unlike the others it nailed it perfectly. The first season is literally flawless in all phases ( only the snarkiest of reviewers and critics will find something to nitpick ). This is a must watch for everyone. Season 1 was only 2nd to Person Of Interest's 5th and final season on my ""Best season of any show this year"" List.",10
North America,OK I just finished seeing the series all in one breath; eight thrilling episodes. You are nostalgic of the 1980s? You like the goonies? X-files? Visitors? Have you played Atari? Do you know what Dungeons and dragons? If the answer is always yes then with this series take center you will have an adrenaline rush that will take you back in time of 36 years. And if the atmosphere in which it's set did not satisfied with everything so well conceived a storyline will take care that you'll be hooked on the chairs until the very last minute. The theme song of the series is brilliant!!! If you have doubt in trying Netflix this series will make you change your mind.,10
North America,I really liked the first episodes. they really gave me chill but the rest of series got really predictable for me. I think if they didn't show a real physical figure for the alien whatsoever until the end it could be more interesting. knowing that we are dealing with! some douche carnivorous plant head aliens that are not really that scary and easily can be knocked down by kids just reduces the excitement of the series.flashbacks were not that amazing still kinda predictable. I could imagine what she had gone through in a classic 80s crazy scientists' experiments myself.Overall it was fun to watch it back to back but not really seeing the potential for this TV series to go any further for having more seasons.,7
North America,"I've used IMDb for at least 10 years now.I never thought about making a review until I saw the first 4 episodes of Stranger Things. What is remarkable about this TV Show is the story writing, 90s nostalgia, the superb acting and everything else! There is never a boring or dull moment. You have everything from Theory of Relativity to teenage girl problems.It is one of those rare stories where a lot of craziness rules the world, but where all the characters are credible, like Lost or Game of Thrones.I have to say, I don't like to make any comparisons to other shows, like I just did. Because you will not know what to expect, since we live in a time where Hollywood mass produces generic Crime series with different covers. This show is truly original and will intrigue you.",10
North America,"STRANGER THINGS was a pleasant surprise. It sprawled comfortably on Netflix's browsing page very recently. Needless to say, I binged all eight (8) episodes in one sitting.STRANGER THINGS, as mentioned in several other reviews, is the ""fruit smoothie"" of 80s culture. Take in a tablespoon of Stephen King, a few dashes of Spielberg, and a whole lot of 80s horror/thriller culture, blend it together and you essentially have STRANGER THINGS.To start off, the fact that this is NOT a reboot or sequel to a film or television show that debuted in the 80s time period is actually relieving. Not that I necessarily have anything against that, but this series really goes to show that an original concept can still be filled with nostalgia but have its own identity. Hopefully, that will encourage future film/series creators.Regarding the show itself, I found myself on several occasions praising the acting (ESPECIALLY by the children), and engrossed with the plot. I can most definitely appreciate the choice of having this as a television show as opposed to a short movie. It really gave a chance to flesh things out. The plot, while relatively simple, is filled with several cliché tropes - however, they are utilized much differently, which is another thing I happened to enjoy. The ""walking backwards and accidentally tripping over something"" action DOES NOT lead to a death. The car engine actually STARTED. The girl actually doesn't give too much of a damn (romantically) about the nerdy/weird/outcast guy EVEN AFTER EXPERIENCING A LIFE-CHANGING SITUATION together. Again: a breath of fresh air.My only real gripe with the show had to be the ending. However, this is all hypothetical and essentially not solid. The plot really showcases itself as a one season deal - however, the show creators already confirmed that season two would be a sequel to season 1. I felt that season one's ending should have been more conclusive as opposed to purposely leaving many loose ends to pick up in season two. HOWEVER, if season two does pick up these loose ends and thread them into something even more awesome, then it's a win-win situation and I will be happy with season one's ending. Also, to nitpick, the underlying themes of ""mystery"" and ""folklore"" seem to be muddled and messy. Individually, the themes are very strong from an episode-to- episode basis; sadly, as a whole, the show really loses these themes and you're left with a pure thriller-adventure as opposed to the cool dark sci-fi feeling.+awesome characters+superb acting+engrossing plot-possibly weak ending-muddled directionSTRANGER THINGS - binge-worthy - 9/10",9
North America,"The story line is gripping from the start, this is not a series i would have normally watched but my husband loves sci-fi. Well worth watching, it is a well-balanced series where the viewer can relate to the characters and it has just the right amount of weird. The story is based around the search for a missing boy, the boys friends and relatives start searching and all start to realise that something unusual and unexplained is the cause of the boys disappearance. The boys friends get the help of a young girl who arrived in town the same time as the boys disappearance, as her story unravels the boys start to realise they have much to learn and vow to find their friend. The plot takes many twists and turns.",10
North America,"Stranger Things is a total flashback to everything that you loved about the 80's! I had the perfect amount of scare factor, anxiety, and nostalgic qualities that I look for in any TV show.The Cast of mostly unknown children: Will, Mike, Lucas, & Dustin did a very believable job to sell this story. Don't get me wrong there are a few parts that will make you chuckle during this 8 hour adventure but those same parts to me made it all the better. I loved the premise of the entire show and found myself numerous times wanting to look away or cover my eyes knowing something was coming and I DID NOT want to see it. The score and music in this series was amazing as well.I am very happy to see Winona Ryder back on TV and she played the Character of Joyce Byers perfectly. Very Believable. I thought her entire performance was great!The remaining supporting cast was also great. David Harbour as Chief Jim Hopper was great as well. He brought the real emotion and feel to his role and the minor subplot that slowly unravels up to the final reveal was amazing. Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven was also Amazing! Every scene she graced was that much better and just her facial expressions alone showed so much emotion. Her subplot as well was wonderful to watch slowly unwind to the reveal as well.I really hope they are able to spin this off for a second season and they left us with that ONE single moment to make it possible and for us viewers to cross our fingers and wait.If you are looking for a great serious with an 80's feel and a fun spin on everything you loved from that era prepare to Binge!",10
North America,"The moment I saw the intro to this show I was transported back to the 80's! I got this euphoria feeling of being a kid again watching those big 80's movies when I still could awed by films... that's when I knew this show was something else.I think this is the best show by Netflix (yes, including House of Cards and Marco Polo, both of which I love) The nostalgia feeling mixed with great acting, story, script, directing make for an awesome series. It felt like a Stephen King story (IT came to mind), hope they make a season 2!Adult actors are all great but it's the kids that run this show... All main kid characters are well rounded and these young actors did a fantastic job.Two thumbs way up.",10
North America,"I haven't really been a fan of Netflix originals apart from How to make a murderer, Narcos and Bloodlines, but after watching the trailer for this I had big expectations. And man, i was not let down! Watching these 8 episodes has been one hell of a ride. This show got everything. Great cast, tremendous acting, a true 80's feel and the highest level of excitement you will get in a TV show. The story is really, really good! Can't wait for Season 2. If you haven't watched it yet you are in for a treat. The ratings don't lie! I love everything about this show. The soundtrack is amazing. This show really takes me back to the 80s. Someone mentioned it's like a mix of x-files and E.T and he is right, only this is even better than those two combines. I think it has a Guilerme Del Toro feel to it, but that does not by any means mean it's not original. it is!",10
North America,"This was the nostalgia itch that I didn't know that I needed scratched. After so many reboots and remakes from my childhood that ultimately fail to deliver more than a hint of what made the originals great, I determined that I must be getting too old and cynical to appreciate things in the same way as I used. It's only a matter of time until I become the ""they don't make them like they used to"" guy. Stranger Things laughs at the notion that the wonder and adventure from that time period can't be recreated, and makes it obvious what the other attempts at capturing this have missed. It doesn't show you that you are in that you are back in your childhood by putting a kid in an Indiana Jones costume and dressing teenagers in loud clothes with big hair. It makes you feel it with a hundred little details that you forgot about and I can't thank the creators enough. Somebody still makes them like they used to, and apparently, I'm still capable of being able to have the same wonder, joy and investment that I did all those years ago.",10
North America,This is some of the best TV I've seen for quite some time. I would say it's more like a Steven King story rather then a Steven Spielberg movie. It's a great mix of the paranormal and sci-fi and as a fan of this kind of genre I had an idea by halfway through the series what was going on. Many of the principal characters are kids but kids stuff it certainly is not. All of the young cast are good but I think Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven really steals the show like Ellie Fanning in Super 8. I'd have to say that the sinister government agency responsible for all distress brought to the Hawkins community were rather sloppy and in reality they would have found the girl (Eleven) a lot sooner. I have a feeling we have not seen the last of her. We know that Sheriff Hooper made some kind of deal with the government agents but it's not clear at this point exactly what it was. It does have a satisfactory ending but with enough loose ends for a further season. Hopefully there is enough interest in this show for a DVD release at some point. Most of the reviews (mine included) have been generally favorable and I do hope that it will have enough of an audience worldwide to give the go ahead for a series two and I also hope that we don't have to wait an entire year for it but more then likely we will.,10
North America,"10/10 Being an 80's kid I loved the setting of this. Giant walkie talkies, 80's jeans (don't miss those!), cycling everywhere with your friends. I loved that everything was 80' even the title and credit fonts, the theme tune that also features in parts of the episodes is fun and mysterious. Casting is excellent which is commendable considering there are many child actors involved. I love the idea of this story showing the kids perspective also. What I love in a series too is when there is a cliffhanger the mystery is opened up in the following episode rather than dragging out story lines for the sake of a longer season. however I also would have been quite happy with a few more episodes as I enjoyed it so much. Can't wait for season 2.",10
North America,"whole story is great. I loved the concept of the series but it is not at all original concept as it is taken from the movie INSIDIOUS. since i loved the concept of the movie i loved it too. The main difference between the concept of the movie and 'stranger things' is that there are monsters on the other side of the world which is stated as 'the upside down', and in the movie it is the devil itself in 'the further'. Another thing i would like to share is that in the series the monsters are kill-able which is good from the perspective of a kid. Overall great experience watching the series. waited for long, for such a great experience. Thanks to all the ones who made this awesome series. Excellent work guys, keep it up.",9
North America,"This is a good show, I like horror/the supernatural, I love(d) the 80ies, it's good to see Wynona again, etc., however, as with Super 8, there is something holding me back from really being able to enjoy this: my gender. All the related/quoted movies/shows (Goonies, Super 8, It, etc.) are from a little boy's viewpoint and experience, celebrating being a boy in the 80ies, doing boy stuff with other boys. Since I am NOT a boy and I did NOT hang with boys (like Alice in Super 8) and I did not have brothers or sons in the 80ies either, I cannot fully relate/identify myself with the nostalgia/ image being shown (and don't get started about that weird girl ""11"", no identification possible/desirable here, either). If I think about what I expected during the 80ies to happen for women and feminism in the future, I am aghast. The situation for women over the last years rather has deteriorated than improved. And hearing African American men complaining about Hollywood/the Academy - they should trying to be a (any) woman!! Kit Harrington being offended that he is slightly reduced to his looks?? Is he for real? Has he been in a coma from his birth on not to realize what it is (still) like for women (in Hollywood and elsewhere)? We are still being heavily discriminated (and offended), not treated (and paid) equal, seen as prey, treated careless (or even violent), being reduced/objectified, not allowed the same things, etc. etc. I know it will never change, and this is just a minor example, but it still IS rude and careless of producers and writers to shut girls out like this and not caring if a program is okay for them, too. I do NOT want to be reduced to love stories (hate it), Grey's Anatomy (hate it) etc. - I want to be considered for any other non-feminine-clichéd genre as well. But as I said: I know, it's never gonna happen, if it didn't happen in the 80ies, it will surely not happen in this reactionary millennium - you women out there know what I am talking about, you go along with the stream like dead fish, feminism is dead.",5
North America,"Where do I begin? This show may only be 8 episodes long but I have never seen such a diverse cast - where not one person fails to impress, each character has star turns and gets a chance to shine - something than many other shows lack. Eleven (Millie Brown) is an absolute stand out in this sci-fi show, and it is fantastic how much you take the journey with her throughout this. No matter of your age, she is the constant stand out in each scene. The direction and editing in this show has been put to amazing use and its as if you are a part of this journey with the characters yourself, it's like you are reading a book and going through each chapter, constantly wanting to read the next. The writing on this show is perfect and when it really hits the high - it stays there, we as a viewer are taken on an emotional roller coaster from start to finish. You believe every scene is as important as the last one and it's good to play close attention to the amount of detail that has been put in to each and every shot, cinematography is beautiful and you can see that the background is used to its full impact. There is this constant reminder of being a child and learning about friendship and love throughout life to when we grow through our teenage years to an adult & parent. All of this along with the fantastic 80's vibe and stand out Soundtrack throughout makes this for an even better watch and works fantastically well. If you were to mix Stephen Spielberg with Stephen King and John Carpenter you have basically got Stranger Things! This isn't just the stand out show of 2016 it's one of the biggest stand out shows ever made in the last 15-20 years and Stranger Things will be talked about for years to come, it is relevant now and will be for many years to come! I for one am already excited for watching this a 2nd time around.",10
North America,"First time reviewer here at IMDb but I had to write a review to say how much I enjoyed this show. In my opinion, it's far and away the best series so far from Netflix, surpassing Making a Murderer as my favorite original Netflix production.Stranger Things was not overly hyped by Netflix, and with 'stars' like Winona Ryder, Matthew Modine and David Harbour, it's not a production featuring many of today's hotter Hollywood actors and actresses. Throw in a rather small budget in terms of sets and special effects, and it's safe to say that I did not have big expectations for this show upon watching the first episode.But from the very first 10 minutes of the superb first episode, the show drags you in and won't let you go. Eight episodes in all, the middle few episodes perhaps drag on a bit, but episodes 1-3, and 7-8 in particular are stunners.The basic premise is a young boy goes missing amidst a series of very bizarre (and at times scary) events in the fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana. Ryder is the young boy's distraught mom. Harbour is the well-intending local sheriff who is trying to figure out just what in the heck is happening in his small town. Modine is the creepy scientist in charge of some weird experiments that the top- secret Department of Energy complex is conducting (why they are based in the middle of Indiana is never quite explained).The whole series takes place in the winter of 1983, and as someone who was still a teenager in that era, I can vouch that the costumes, props and look of every episode is spot on. It frequently pays homage to movies from that era such as ET, The Thing, Stephen King horror films and books, as well as newer movies that also took on a similar theme (Super 8).But while Super 8 ultimately disappointed me with a poor ending and acting that never drew you in, Stranger Things succeeds with strong writing from start to finish, and actors who you truly sympathize with and feel empathy for. The series is carried by the young actors, who across the board are great whether they are portraying heroes, nerds or creeps.Topping the production was Millie Bobby Brown as the supernatural heroine Eleven. She is going to be a future star in Hollywood, mark my words. The four young actors playing her friends (and Will, the boy they are trying to save) are also solid but not quite as memorable.After Eleven, my favorite two performers were Natalia Dyer as Nancy Wheeler, a teenage girl trying to come to terms with her sexuality and maturity; and Charlie Heaton as Jonathan Byers, Will's weird older brother who is trying to keep his family sane in a very tragic situation. Dyer could easily pass for Mia Sara's daughter. Heaton looks he could be Bill Hader's son.Kudos too to the Duffer Brothers for keeping the production moving along at a brisk level. And while the series wraps up with a mostly positive ending, there are just a few hints thrown out at the end to suggest that Stranger Things may still be in store in the future of poor Hawkins, Indiana.So if you're a fan of Stephen King, early 1980's tributes, and science fiction, give Stranger Things a chance. You'll be very happy you did.",10
North America,"Netflix, you've done it again. Another quality production. The cast were excellent, the story-line fresh and new and the script was riveting and exciting. UNFORTUNATELY, ... I got overly excited and watch all 8 episodes in one day. I should have stretched it out but, hey, ... I loved it. I do have a question, however. There seemed to be an opening for another season at the end. Am I right? I realize that may not have been the intention but I know that I would certainly love to see another one. Of course, bringing back El would have to be a foregone conclusion. I would also have to agree with a previous reviewer that mentioned that the government entourage was pretty weak in this series. I would suggest beefing them up and making them more believable in any future effort.",9
North America,"It's the perfect mini series featuring all genres: Mystery, Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Love, Adventure, Horror, all of the above! A gr8 series your whole family will enjoy. Targets anybody, all ages. The Producers have done a gr8 job with each characters scripts, which keeps you on edge with what's going to happen next.I love all the young actors, especially El, she does an amazing job at acting! The whole story line was well needed thought out, and pulls at every one of your emotions.I can't wait to see a sequel, and can only guess what will happen next. I rate it a 10/10! Totally worth while watching:)",10
North America,"This show is unique and stands on its own. The setting (1983) was extremely well done and made people my age feel like it was their childhood again.It's good to see that out of all the same formula shows being put out there, and disappointing ""sci-fi"" shows (I'm looking at you Sense8) that something new and refreshing comes.I was hooked from the first episode and watched it for all 7ish hours straight. The kid actors do a fantastic job as do the adults.The ending is both satisfying and leaves plenty of questions (not in a bad way) that will easily lead to a second season. Absolutely terrific show, can't recommend highly enough.",10
North America,"This show has great actors, a very well-written plot that keeps you in suspense every epidsode. I binged watched all 8 shows in two days. Reasons to watch this show - characters' emotions and reactions are much more true to real life than how most shows are written, 80's nostalgia that isn't all ruffle skirts, sprayed feathered hair, and blue eyeshadow; the episodes are written as chapters of a story and not separate episodes. I also like how not all of the information is given to you right away, hence great writing of a serial show. Episodic shows are stories each in their own tied together with an inner story. This show is like watching a book your reading. I like that and so did my kids. They couldn't get enough of it. I like that each character has their own flaws and there's no perfect hero. I can't think of anything to improve upon. The special effects were great and believable. There wasn't too much of it either. Maybe the only unbelievable part is the character of the the science teacher. He's a little too naive. And the bullies are a little too extreme. Most kids would back down and never say a word if they saw what Eleven could do. Bullies usually back down once challenged. After the kid peed himself, I can't imagine he would go back for more. There's very few people that would keep up that kind of hatred.Love the show. Want more.",9
North America,"On the surface, the new Netflix original series ""Stranger Things"" is a science fiction/paranormal thriller set in a small 1980's suburban town where a group of kids and others confront mysterious and terrifying forces. However more importantly, this series is a marriage of elements from classic Spielberg and Stephen King, and acts as a love letter to 80's cinema. Direct or subtle references are made to ""The Thing"", ""Halloween"", ""It"", ""The Goonies"", ""Stand By Me"", ""E.T."", ""Carrie"", ""Jaws"", ""The Shining"", ""Poltergeist"", ""Evil Dead"", and possibly even more films that I did not recognize. Combining these clever homages to classic cinema with incredible pacing, cinematography, soundtrack, and performances makes this series one of my absolute favorites. I highly recommend giving this series a look even if you don't understand the many homages and references just because of how well this show is directed. I would even describe the small town setting, mysterious antagonistic forces, dramatic pacing, and desperate investigation for truth as a more easily digestible form of True Detective season 1, another absolute favorite of mine. Another comparison likely to be made is to J.J. Abrams ""Super 8"", however the narrative similarities are simply due to both of these works accomplishing the same thing, giving an appreciative and nostalgic nod to Spielberg's classic work. If I had to choose some weaker elements of ""Stranger Things"", I suppose they would be predictability in the plot and lack of complexity in the dialogue.TLDR: I loved it, definitely give it a shot",9
North America,"Thank you Netflix! Stranger Things to me is a masterpiece in so many ways. The directing, the acting, the setting, the feeling is spot on. All acting is above par with a roller-coaster of emotions mixed with drama, suspense, comedy and the overall mixture of the characters works well. Bringing the audience back to the 80's is an understatement, they do it perfect and it feels good. The ET/Goonies/X-Files environment this show carries to the audience is a total win. It makes me feel very special to watch a show of this high caliber. Oh yeah.. Excellent soundtrack for sure! 10 out of 10 and it deserves much more!I very much hope more seasons will be released, as I assume there will be. It is going to be very hard patiently waiting for more.",10
North America,"Much have been written about this series love for the early 80s. And it's understandable. The whole period of John Carpenter, Steven Spielberg, teenage horror-movies and cold war paranoia has been mixed together to a real tasty love potion. If you're too young and don't love the 80s for sentimental reasons you probably will after a few episodes of Stranger Things.The story is set in a small rural town and revolves around a missing boy. His friends is soon dragged into a mystery and an adventure. Goonies and I.T. with the BMX bikes, nerds turning into heroes and a friendship story worthy a Spielberg movie. But there is so much more. The older sister have her own problems and her adventure makes an equally intriguing and fun story including all the ingredients for a classic high school horror movie. Under age drinking, skinny dipping and stupid boyfriends. And finally there is the confused and distraught mother and the towns sheriff also trying to solve the mystery.What impresses me the most is how the series manages to keep all three parts of the plot relevant and interesting all the way to the climax. The pacing is mostly perfect and so is the acting. The child characters are all well played, specially Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven and the funny character Dustin played by Gaten Matarazzo. Of course Winona Ryder is brilliant as the desperate mother.The 80s atmosphere is well set with great horror sequences with the mandatory light flickering, scare jumps and electronic music that could have been made by John Carpenter. There is a lot of John Carpenter stuff going on here and it's great. Some of the inspirations for the series are even featured in one way or the other. Stephen King, The Thing, Michael Myers, and a few more.The only weaknesses I can find here is the somewhat uninteresting bad guys. And David Harbours sheriff doesn't do it for me. His character don't add up so to speak. There is something missing there. But these minor flaws are very minor.Stranger Things is defiantly some of the best TV I've seen for the last three years or so.",8
North America,"I likely would not have enjoyed this series as much if not for the Duffer Brothers' choice to set it in the early 80s. It had every bit of the feel of an early Stephen King, produced by Steven Spielberg, directed by Joe Dante. There are some who feel that the subplot with the boys is reminiscent of The Goonies. I completely disagree. It felt like The Explorers (1985).The acting was solid. Ryder and Harbour carried the day, but Millie Bobby Brown, Finn Wolfhard, Gaten Matarazzo, and Caleb McLaughlin really did an incredible job. Young people should not be this talented! I can't wait to see them elsewhere.There were very few errors in setting (one minor error in the sound track). Even little details like the wicker back on the chairs pulled me back.The eerie feel of being in the woods and the electrical problems around town really contributed to a dark feeling. I didn't feel like this was horror, more like it was suspense.The one flaw in the show was the monster. Show-not-tell should have prevailed until the very last episode. Then a bit more imagination would have been warranted.I can't wait for a season 2, though I'd be more than happy with them leaving this plot and going elsewhere.",9
North America,"Gotta say, I'm extremely surprised of the nose dive Stranger Things took after 3-4 good episodes.Not a fan of the Lost/Stephen King school of mystery crap where you don't have to explain anything. That's super lazy.I called out Lost after five episodes into season one. This after reading heaps of Stephen King books during the 80- 90's. Dean R Koontz is above King in my opinion (Read Twilight Eyes or Whispers). He always provides an explanation to his mysteries and they are always amazing. In hindsight, this show was a letdown.But the kid actors were amazing. Especially the toothless one. What a star! Writing and humour was excellent also. And that Carpeterish soundtrack, lovely...I feel Lando'd by this show.",5
North America,"The new Netflix show 'Stranger Things' is pretty much exactly what it looks like: a very loving and painstakingly recreated tribute to 80s Spielberg films in particular, and just about every teen fantasy/horror movie from that decade in general, with a soundtrack to match.There's little original about it but in this instance that's not really the point - it's more about acknowledging the magic and wonder of the best of those movies and trying to specifically recreate that in a different century in a very devoted and respectful way.It probably falls sort of true greatness because of this indebtedness, but the fact of the matter is it's just very, very nice to sink into an 8-hour cut of E.T and Close Encounters, Poltergeist, Hellraiser, Stand By Me and, uh... The Goonies that never existed before.*EDIT* I have to add, though, that the second season is awful.",5
North America,"If you're familiar with Stephan Spielberg's films, and find yourself enjoying them more times than not, then you really owe it to yourself to watch this series. Story: 9 The main plot revolves around finding a lost boy, Will, and a government experiment gone horribly wrong. This plot is extremely thrilling and sucks me into the screen every time the show is focused on it, however, the rather generic high school subplot that laces most of Nancy's story line lacks some creative ""umph"" if you will. But that's where the characters come in. Characters: 9 Stranger Things does an exemplary job of building a believable, well directed, well scripted main cast, yet, the side characters suffer from blandness. The three boys are phenomenally well written, it was a nostalgic rush of hanging out with my friends as a kid. Sound: 9 The techno beats underlying the tense scenes are gorgeous and give this series a unique musical identity. Visuals: 8 The sets were amazing, they appeared and felt exactly like an 80's town. The monster, however, is clearly not where most of the budget went. Overall: 9 You'll laugh, cry, and scream as you watch this cast suffer through and eventually triumph over a daunting mystery.",9
North America,"Let's set The Twilight Zone, Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Maverick, Quantum Leap, Seinfeld, and Breaking Bad to one side a moment. These were shows that were great not only for their brilliant writing and production value but also for their originality. They either created, defined or redefined a genre. Stranger Things is another thing entirely. Another, completely NEW thing which is, in itself, original.But I doubt this will ignite an entire genre, and this is why I consider it unique and incomparable to traditionally groundbreaking shows. Stranger Things is retro. This is obvious and has been noted by everyone. But I don't know if many people have noticed the ASTONISHING attention to detail. Lots of shows are set in history. And lots of shows do a good job of it. But Stranger Things is perfect. It's perfect, not in that it is a perfect reflection of the 80s. It does a damn good job of that. But it goes several steps further. Stranger Things also captures the cinematic style of the 80s. And it does it with such acute accuracy that it is truly mind blowing for a writer and filmmaker who grew up on 80s cinema and was primarily influenced by it as a child. (Me).I'd like to take a moment to specifically note the props. When I was a boy in the 80s, that was the furniture we actually owned. It is perfect in every detail. The girl's room could have been my sister's room. My sister literally had that exact music box with the ballerina in it. Furthermore, the show draws attention to brands that were popular in the 80s. This adds a touch of authenticity. Sure. But what is so brilliant about this is that it's done in the kind of obvious way that 80s movies did it.I'd also like to address the brilliance of the casting. I realized something about attraction many years ago. There is traditional look, there are unique looks, and there are fashionable looks. In every major era of cinema, there are particular ""types"" that the industry, for whatever reason, tends to like to cast. The 80s had an extreme version of this. And almost everyone in this cast is straight out of 80s casting. (Winona Ryder is an exception. I actually love Winona Ryder, but I think casting her in this was a mistake). The daughter is a great example of this. She reminds me of the actress from The Great Outdoors Lucy Deakins (I just looked that up) and several other actresses from the era. I honestly don't understand how these filmmakers are getting these performances out of these actors. My guess (and this really is just a guess) is that much of this was casting. I think probably the actors they chose, not only were perfect because they fit the 80s look, but also because they fit the 80s style of acting. Much of acting is exploiting natural quirks in your real character, and my guess is that many of these actors all had a natural tendency to be this way. Tendencies that might not be particularly charming in a typical 2016 project, but that are perfect for this. The filmmakers may also have had them watch 80s performances to try to emulate. Either way, credit needs to be given to the filmmakers for this.But the writing is where it all begins. The foundation of it all. Here's why I'm so impressed with the writing. They didn't just include a lot of good 80s stuff, they included 80s clichés. And not even good clichés. They added clichés that are kind of lame like completely senseless character motivations that we're just supposed to buy because it's movie logic. This show really steeps itself in movie logic and I LOVE IT. I usually hate this but, in this case, it's a beautiful homage to 80s films. And what really works for me is that they do it with a real reverence. Any time they include movie logic, the do it with the same straight face as was done in the 80s. There is no tongue in cheek; it's a perfect mimeograph.There are so many little touches. Kids-on-bikes being a signature of 80s cinema, especially with Spielberg. A lot of this seems to be very Spielbergian, but there are so many 80s films that this project draws from that I wouldn't define the influence so narrowly. As a writer and filmmaker myself, I can't help but watch, jaw open, astonished and mesmerized by this project. It's truly incomparable to other films or television projects. It's something entirely new and different, and I think it will stand apart for a very long time. I've never seen this level of accuracy in the depiction of an era, and I lived through the era. And maybe that's why it's so compelling to me. The first 10 years of my life were 1980-1990 and, in many ways, those are the most important year of one's life. It's one's introduction to the world, to one's self, to sights and sounds and smells, music, food, entertainment, etc. I don't think about the 80s all that much. I didn't love it. But I can tell you, there are things about my childhood that I haven't thought about for years, that this show has drawn back into the forefront of my mind. Wonderful things. And something makes me think that, maybe, our world is a little more synthetic today. Somehow the world was more ""real"" back then. I don't tend to buy into this idea that everything was better before smartphones, but... maybe some things were better. I don't know. I suppose, love it or hate it, this show has made this viewer think about some things, and that's one of the most important things great art can do.",10
North America,"So happy I found this. A great classic sci-fi horror with some great done directing! The story is coherent, not like in the many many series and movies that come out these days and it is just a testimony to the classics that we love so much, without simply coping it,but adding it's own style and flavor. And where did you found those kids - amazing acting, absolutely amazing. It is one of the strongest points of this show, the young actors who really bring it to life. I am amazed how well do they do their job to immerse you in this terrifying but also innocent world. Great job to everybody that work on this show and thanks for the good time! Expecting the next season :)Highly recommend to everyone who is a fan of the genre or just likes something that is really good!",10
North America,"I like EVERYTHING about this show. Acting is great, character development, story, attention to details, pace. A mix of the best classics from Spielberg, King and Shyamalan. Being a kid of the 80s, I really enjoyed all the details, the score, the fonts, the obvious reference to classic films and music from that era. Creature CGI could have been better, but won't complain because the overall quality of this show is well over average.The only downside is that I've already went through all 8 episodes... It truly felt like an 8 hour movie, but I never got bored.Man I hope they make a second season.",10
North America,"I am not a huge fan of science fiction, but I like this show. I am especially happy to see Winona Rider acting again. Fun, interesting, and a plot that keeps it's twists and turns going. The makers seem to have gone out of their way to find people who don't look like Hollywood. The kids are pretty good actors, too. Due to a few somewhat scary scenes, and kids using guns,I'd not recommend this for children under 10 or 11. I'm giving it a five for one reason and one reason only. The sound is so out of control I'm entirely annoyed by it. The sound on my remote goes from 1 to 100. At times, to hear the dialog, I have had to push it up to 96. Then when the music comes on, I find myself pushing it down to 75 or just turning on the mute button. Aggravating to say the least and really takes away from my enjoyment of the show. If it weren't for this, I'd being give it an 8.",5
North America,"If you took equal parts Half Life video game, Super 8, and Bridge to Terabithia you'd end up with Stranger Things. It's not really got enough content to stretch over 8 episodes - would have made a much tidier 2 hour movie. The kids are exactly what you expect them to be and even the most jaded viewer knows Eleven won't be allowed to hang around at the end of the series - love this poignant and sweet can never be permitted! There was a nice nod to ET with the car chase and bicycles, though with a twist to allow for Eleven's emerging powers.Characters make confusing choices (Nancy) and the main villain is never much more than a one dimensional ""government man"". Parents are, as always in kid-focused movies, CLUELESS. The main problem I think is that the Duffer brothers said ""Here are our influences.."" and proceeded to script the series, instead of digging into themselves and coming up with something more original. It's exactly what I thought it would be from the trailer, but somehow I expected more. Good soundtrack though. Also, don't be put off by Winona's inclusion - even though she gets top billing in the credits she's not the main focus - thank God.",5
North America,"This series is more than just a itch scratcher for 1980s nostalgia, it's an almost perfect re-imagination of a genre not replicated since the 1980s; movie Super 8 looks clumsy and is boring compared to this excellent series. The characters look 80s, the casting itself is very 1980s, nerdy kids and their nerdy friends with bad 80's hair. The language and style of acting is also very 80s but it's more of a streamlined 1980s, the editing, direction and cinematography, lighting is better than your typical 80's Goonies or even ET I think. I must emphasize that this is a grown up version of the 80s ET type genre, people get shot in the head etc and teenage kids rendezvous in the toilets to make out etc so it's not that innocent comedic thread that runs right the way through ET for example although there are many moments like that particularly with the main group of protagonist kids. I must say that the costumes, sets and the props (BMX bikes, giant walkie talkies, HAM radio kits, 80s circular telephone dials, 80s style houses in small town America, big 80s American cars etc go a long way to making this look authentic. What can I say, this is truly excellent and everyone involved should be proud of themselves. In some ways this is the ultimate love letter to Steven Spielberg, it's a labour of love and just doesn't it show it....",10
North America,"Hope you have read the official storyline.One of the most beautiful things about this story is that it is set in the 80s. Its just like watching it 30 yrs back, not something that was made now and made to look old (I hope you get what I mean). Only difference (but really appreciated), is the beautiful HD (and no grainy crap too).The characters are so reminiscent of the Enid Blyton kids who solve mysteries - their true friendship, need to help and adventurous spirit, all make you truly fall in love with them. And into this comes in a beautiful girl (not talking about prettiness), for whom you really feel love and compassion. And then there are the teenagers and adults all of whom in their own way bring out the various feelings inside us.Basically its the characters that make this show great. The good storyline, pacing, editing, etc., give these characters a solid framework to take us on an adventure. And you don't have to wait each week, forgetting the story and loosing the touch. The entire thing was released together (8 episodes, 6 hrs), so we can finish the story at a go.The story itself is quite simple - Battling alien like monsters from an alternate universe. They could have easily done a 1.5 hr movie, but this longer version is nicer because it gave us a chance to meet these interesting people and spend a longer time with them. I was really sad to see it end. The way it ended, I think there could be a 2nd season. The ending was also a little sad, and I am hoping the 2nd season may have a solution.Quality is on par with Mr.Robot, Person of Interest, etc., so I can easily recommend it to you.Hope I could give you an idea about what to expect. Cheers...PS: It is so happy to see kids who don't have ipads. Kids who loved to use their imagination and who loved to cycle out in the open over long distances. I could feel their freedom and free spirit...............",9
North America,"Most of you are aware of how Netflix works. When they premiere an original series you get the entire season all at once. Last Friday Netflix unleashed 'Stranger Things', a mystery Science Fiction/Horror set in the 1980's. The story opens with the disappearance of a young boy with devastating effect on his mother (Winona Ryder) and his three classmates. Many of the classic elements of films from the 80's era are presented here. There are older classmates, bullies all, with the exception a girl in their group, who becomes attracted to the missing boy's older brother, an outsider. This creates friction. Matthew Modine is lurking about sinisterly with a clear connection to a strange young girl who appears and becomes involved with our three young heroes. The town's Chief of Police becomes increasingly convinced that unnatural forces are behind the disappearance. Oh, yeah. There's an inter-dimensional monster on the loose to boot. Imagine, if you will, 'The Goonies' meets the 'X-Files' meets 'The Outer Limits'. So far, so good. A fun tribute to the horror films of the '80's. I just wished that I had kept in mind that most films of that genre sucked in the 80's. Because along came episode 8, the season finale, with the realization that I'd just wasted 8 hours of my life. The story implodes into a senseless mess. Plot lines introduced aren't just left dangling, they seem forgotten. Characters who seemed relevant are rendered otherwise. And don't look for questions raised to be answered. The creators, The Duffer Brothers (Make that the Doofus Brothers.) hope you'll stay subscribed to Netflix for season two. I had hoped that this would be a self-contained story, with season two venturing elsewhere, ala 'American Horror Story'. No such luck. There's just not enough depth here for me to waste any more of my time should it return. As a rule I'm quite capable of deleting garbage from my memory. Okay, I lied. I'm still scarred by last winter's reboot of 'The X-Files'. I'll add that Stephen King gave this a thumbs up. That should have served as a warning to me since I feel his integrity as an author has been lacking for some time ('Under the Dome', anyone?). I'd have given the series a score of 8/10 but the finale ruined it. 4/10",8
North America,"I was very curious to see Winona Rider in a TV series. I was actually pleasantly surprised. She hit kind of a slump after Edward Scissorhands (a classic); she honestly pulled out with this series. I also really enjoy the character Eleven very much. She is a really strong actress. What is most impressive is her use of her voice. She has a sort of smooth, naïve tone; yet, there is a lot hidden depth in her. If her character is pursued in later seasons, in some sort of exposé, I would very well be pleased. The character development with the characters Steve, Nancy, and Jonathan is also brilliant. All three I very much hated near the beginning; however, by the end of the season, I found myself content with them. I see this especially with Nancy, who seems to be a much more solid, strong lady by the end of the season. I couldn't find any plot holes at all. I do feel a slight uneasiness because of slight abruptness of Barb's appearance. I would have liked to have her around longer. By and large, an excellent endeavor.",10
North America,Basically this shows is pretty good besides the fact they copy every 80s TV cliché and movie from that time out there.from Alf ..Back to the future two ...lord of the rings to the hobbit cartoons and big props to poltergeist plus a little Freddy Krueger in it LOLnot kidding very addictive show I watched it in two days eight hours of my timethat because Netflix is doing a pretty good job these days surprisingly..with the fallout of Neflix stocks recently and the rate increases LOL JK JK,8
North America,"I have been a TV show buff for a long time, but i've always been too lazy to write any reviews. As good as some of the stuff i've seen over the years was (e.g. Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, House of Cards, Firefly, Sopranos, etc.), nothing has ever compelled me to get off my idle butt and actually put into words how i feel about it. Well, at least until now. Because finally there is a something that is so absolutely, mindblowingly good, that it feels like i don't really have a choice but to try and tell the world about it.This show is something special. The storytelling, the cinematography, the acting (including the child actors), the pacing, the music, the 80's nostalgia and pop-culture references, even something as trivial as the opening credits and title screen... everything about this show screams perfection. I'm curious what Netflix will throw at us next. I don't expect they will be able to maintain this level of quality with their future productions, but even coming close to it every now and then would probably put them ahead of the competition, including HBO.In summary, i think Stranger Things is a masterpiece and pretty much the best TV production i've ever seen. If it was a movie, it would rank among my top 5 movies of all time, that's how good it is. If you haven't seen it yet, you owe it to yourself to watch it ASAP. You won't regret it :)",10
North America,"OK I rated this a 4 only because I think it's getting way too high a rating so I wanted to balance it out. It's probably worth a 6 or 7 at most. But definitely not nearly a 10. There is a great deal of hysteria going on over this show and not a lot of actual critical thought. First of all, yes it's a cute story but it's extremely derivative (i.e. it's stealing all it's ideas from other places including but not limited to Asian sci fi horror flicks) and often trite & clunky. The dialogue is cheesy & stilted at times and some of the acting is appalling. In particular WINONA RYDER!! What has happened to her? She was unwatchable at times her over-acting was so irritating. Fortunately, tho I was tempted to quit watching half way through due to Ryder & some other actors terrible acting, I stuck with it and simply skipped over most of Winona's scenes. As it turned out this made no difference to the story line and made the whole viewing experience so much better. If you want to do the same thing you just have to be careful - there are a couple of important bits with her in them & they are watchable enough because her dialogue in them is limited. Anyway - I think it's a fun series to watch but try not to expect too much even tho the ridiculously high rating tempts you to do just that. Also watch out for Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven. Her performance alone is worth sticking with the show for. She is brilliant & manages to save the show from being pretty mediocre. Girl has a big future ahead of her.So anyway - do watch it! It's fun, has a nice 80's vibe & a cool 80's soundtrack (for the most part) but just don't get misled by the current hysterical popularity of the show. It's not as good as the ratings suggest, it's just enjoying a lot of buzz & hype, much like Pokemon Go. It's a shame really because my overly high expectations ruined it for me I think.",4
North America,"The plot was interesting enough to finish the series but it was too often tedious and focused on adolescent drama that is better suited for the preteen crowd. I would rather have watched this in a denser and more focused 90 minute movie. I found myself wanting to fast forward many times, and I often did. There is a fine line between drama/suspense and just bad writing/clichés. This show often dances on that line. As far as the acting goes, I think everyone did a good job, but Winona wasn't a great fit for the role. Her celebrity made the show focus a little too much on her character at times and she came across annoyingly crazy for the first half of the series. She has a lot of energy and a very specific voice, maybe its just me, but while she is talented, I'm just not sure she was a good fit. Overall, I think it had a good plot, good actors, but the writing was off, and the directing tried to make up for it but didn't quite work. I don't understand all the rave reviews. Everyone I know watched the entire series, but as I said, most of us were on the fence between tedium and curiosity. Not as satisfying as it could have been. Definitely got the feeling they were struggling to stretch it out over 8 episodes.",5
North America,"First time I logged in to write a review...but I HAD to. What an outstanding series....I hope there is more to come though I don't know if one could hit the mark like this again. As another said, a perfect blend of all that was great about movies from the 1980's. So if you are into that, this is going to be a series that you don't want to end. I always tend to re-watch movies from the 80's for the fantastic story telling that isn't in modern day cinema. Love, love, LOVE this! I keep saying out loud, ""Gahd who wrote this stuff...this is great."" I find it hard not to proceed on to the next episode, and at the same time don;t want to watch them too fast so that it is over.",10
North America,"The setting, the characters, the actors, the background score, the story, the writing and the pacing everything is almost perfect. This is what a true thriller should be and NETFLIX keep doing the good work by green lighting such shows. Those 4 Kids are gems, we should be seeing more of them. Not a single moment across 8 episodes is boring. I binge watched all the episodes today. I mean I watched 8 episodes in 10 hrs I took 2 breaks in between like an hr each. Duffer brothers maintain the quality in 2nd season as well I am sure Netflix will soon give a green light to the next season. I wanted to give it a 9.3, since IMDb allows only whole number ratings and I didn't want to give it a 9 so I gave it a 10. Must watch.",10
North America,"Usually, I'm not super excited about new shows on netflix when they pop up on there. But this one seemed alright, so I gave it a shot.And ohh my God was this a phenomenal show!I read a review that described this show as a mix between Steven King and Spielberg's works from the 80's and it totally feels that way.It is a mix of genres, drama, horror, mystery, sci-fi, supernatural thriller and so on. But knows what it is going for and what it is about, so it is more of a synergy than a hodgepodge of genres and tones.There's a certain metaphor that runs through the season with the kids that I found brilliant and comedic at times. It sort of tied the series and its events together, but I can't give any more details.The acting was superb, from the kids to the adults. No weak performances whatsoever. The direction was also excellent.This had real weight. You cared about the characters and their interactions and attachments with each other. You felt the drama. It wasn't just thrown at you trying to make you feel something like many dramas can do.What I found original was that there was three layers of main characters, each with their own part to play in the mystery. The adult main characters, the teenagers and the kids. And each with their own arcs in relation to the other characters in their level of age.I loved the synthesized soundtrack, that truly set the tone and setting.If I had to nitpick, I would say that the bullies were the standard antagonists to drive the plot and drama with the kids, but the actors in those roles still acted well and they were secondary characters.This is one show that truly deserves the hype and ratings it is getting.I don't know who these Duffer brothers are, but they may be destined for more.",10
North America,The show is absolutely amazing it keeps you on edge as it goes i cant believe i just sat there for the hole season eyes watering and mouth open my god the suspense thank you Netflix and i hope you bring in season 2 because this show is rocking Its one of the best that i have seen in 2016 i recommend that you watch it no matter the age and don't be thrown off that its main's are children ... mind blowing.The creators have done an amazing job i recommend that more shows find originality and make you binge like so .The trailer shows things but just enough to make you see it(the show) to the full it does reveal some aspects like ESP but not nearly enough to even guess whats going on .Again congrats to the creators its marvelous a masterpiece Oscar!!- well deserved.,10
North America,"This is one of the best shows I have watched. It stands on the tier of many great shows in the media today. I am not a huge fan of Sci-Fi films and shows, but this one was just absolutely amazing. It surpassed all of the expectations I had for it. Immediately when I hear aliens, I was nervous about beginning this show. Needless to say, I am glad I took a chance. The character development is fabulous. I became very connected with every character involved. The all around mood and setting is extremely cinematic! The score was great! I watched this with my mom who enjoyed the music a lot being that the music was from the 80s. It gave me a Super 8 vibe, the movie by J.J. Abrams. I really enjoyed that movie as well even though it was Sci-Fi, but I think this show is far better and I was very impressed with Super 8. I loved it! I strongly recommend this show for all ages! It had me on the edge of my seat until the final episode's credits rolled.",10
North America,"This was an astonishing film.I was slowly captured and confidently wheeled in, and what a ride! It portraits an honorable homage to all the movies I loved watching when I was 10-13. Spielberg certainly comes to mind, but also some of Carpenters work, and dare I say Stephen King. The nod to Dungeons & Dragons is classy but also tone-setting.In spite of the many thrills during the series, it does not use CGI or scary-tricks a lot, which I think is very refreshing watching the current tendencies.The series works with values such as relationships between parents and children, best friends, and even a slight touch of romance. But, like in the eighties, the core value is friendship.Oh, and the soundscape is hypnotic!",10
North America,"This is the second show I have ever felt compelled to rate however, it is the best series I have ever watched. The show is well written the characters have depth especially 11, and the show does one thing most shows fail to do now days they leave you wanting more.The casting is awesome every character adds to the show, and the main cast is top notch. Winona Rider delivers an award winning performance, but the best hands down is Millie Bobby Brown. I have never seen her before and it appears she is a newer actress but that kid delivers one of the strongest performances I have ever seen in a child actress. I also enjoyed Gaten Matarazzo as well. Although I did not mention the other kids honestly they were all great.",10
North America,"I'm a fan of Stranger Things. Its yet another retro series but this one works for a whole variety of reasons where others have failed.First of all its well cast, with characters who have an 80's vibe. There's the stressed out working mother capably played by Winona Ryder complimented by a Goonies style group of kids who really fit their roles, right up to the 80's hairdo's and love of classically nerdy, Dungeons and Dragons.Its good stuff backed up by sound story lines that taps into a myriad of 80's films and television series with a sci fi, horror, conspiracy theory twist.All in all, there's a lot to like here and I hope as this series progresses, the nostalgia train rolls on offering more ""strange tales"" from the era of Ronald Regan, Thatcher and Pac Man. Eight out of ten from me.",8
North America,"Now I know they have a lot of reviews about this Netflix original show but not many shows do I give a 10 stars too so I thought why not explain my admiration very quickly about this series. I'm 36 born 1980 so these kids were pretty much my age when this show was set which is a throwback 70's 80's horror mystery. Now it's not the terrifying slasher knife wielding or ghostly horror yet it does involve some creepy scenes with disgusting gooey dimensions and a monster. But it is all done masterfully and with perfect timing. now in a few of the early episodes I felt myself getting impatient wanting more but then I realized I needed to slow down and give the story a chance to unveil itself properly and it definitely does. I don't wanna give anything away because the acting of everyone in the series was superb the score gives you the eerie feeling without being corny the writing directing and filming I know will win awards and it's a series that will reel you in no matter what genre of movies your into because it has it all horror ,mystery,comedy,action and a touch of romance now I always ask myself why do I continue to keep my Netflix account with the repetitive movies and the delay in new arrivals but then I always remember I have about 10 shows I love and they are all Netflix originals and now ""Stranger Things"" is at the top of the list. Since this series is more like a long movie I don't know how long they can keep this up but I am rooting for this to be the first of many more to come.",10
North America,"As some of you may know, when Netfilx produces a series each season is available to watch in full, at once, as opposed to episode by episode... I happen to prefer this method of delivery as it allows the viewer to complete a whole ""book in a series"" (for lack of a better analogy), in their own time rather than ""chapter by chapter"" at the behest of any given network... I find this especially helpful when a series reads more like a movie and follows the characters and how their relationships shape events... As opposed to a storyline that is strung together by a series of events within the same genre and where the main characters' lives only add a background element to the story (think CSI or Law & Order)... With that said, I was hooked after ""Chapter One"" and enthusiastically completed the first season within 24 hours!!When it comes to nostalgia, the 1980's are my favorite cinematic decade. So many great classics were created and produced by iconic filmmakers such as John Hughes, Steven Spielberg, James Cameron, Rob Reiner, Ridley Scott and Tim Burton, just to name a small few… And I have yet to see a remake or updated version of an '80s flick which has even come close to doing the original justice! However, there is something positive to be said about the rise of television shows in which the plots are being meticulously created and told within a relevant era from the past… I believe ""Stranger Things"" has done a stellar job of accomplishing just this feat.In this first season, the young cast does the show a great justice by drawing the viewer into a very relatable and memorable decade from our past. Through the use of various inspirations from '80s pop culture and by keeping true to the look and feel of this particular time period, the writers have created an impressive world for viewers to connect with and get sucked into! Without giving too much away and inadvertently spoiling this season for you, I'll simply describe ""Stranger Things"" as ""The Goonies"" meets ""E.T."" in a twisted, interdimensional game of Dungeons & Dragons (as if written by Steven King and directed by Spielberg)… This is, of course, my own personal take on the plot… So, I can't promise that you'll agree with my comparisons, but if anything you've read above has peaked your interest and/or you enjoy being warped to another time and place, then I definitely urge you to check this show out for yourself!",9
North America,"Stranger Things seems to have come out of nowhere, I had never heard of it right up until they released the trailer last month. So if you didn't know, Stranger Things is a Netflix original series created by The Duffer Brothers and is set in 1983 Indiana where a young boy goes missing in a small town where strange things are happening and an unusual girl shows up.So right away, this setting is genius. I never lived in the 80s but after this I really feel as though I was there, they didn't bang you over the head with it shoving pop culture references at you every minute but just how they dressed, their hair, the posters on a bedroom wall, it all seemed so natural and not gimmicky at all. The movie Super 8 did this to a certain degree and I enjoy that movie but Stranger Things seemed to make it more real to me. What added to it especially was the music, from the opening credits to the score itself, the use of synth music worked excellently to bring you this mysterious, fascinating and yet nostalgic atmosphere; so all-in-all they really did well with the setting and time-period and will definitely be checking out the soundtrack, all of which served as a brilliant backdrop to the plot.As I said, a kid goes missing; it's something we've seen many times in television and film but because it is such an urgent, fearful, disturbing event you are instantly following the case because you want to know what has happened and you want to see him back; so from the very first episode I was hooked and I was staying. Now the series is only eight episodes and I think that's a good thing; a lot of American shows have upwards of twenty and sometimes that can lose momentum and become very episodic, which works depending on the nature of the series, but I do enjoy a lot of British shows where they usually have between six and thirteen episodes negating the need for fillers and can concentrate on a good script. Here the Duffer Brothers have crafted a simple but very well written story that feels more like a movie; each episode follows on instantly from the previous with no recaps or 'Next Time' trailers so if you were to watch Stranger Things, a binge is required. The also know when to show things and when to not, they spent their budget wisely and paid wonderful homage to the Hollywood of that time giving you visuals reminding you of things like The Goonies and E.T. These callbacks also never detract from the plot and fit the story well; also despite the 80s adventure inspiration, Stranger Things isn't necessarily for the Spielberg audience with one or two darker moments scattered here and there.Now I can't do this review without mentioning the cast. Winona Ryder and David Harbour are really well cast as the adult leads, from the desperate mother who still holds out faith to the driven police chief taking on mysterious government agents. The rest of the cast are largely unknown including the main kids but they were so talented. Millie Bobby Brown and Finn Wolfhard being highlights having to display complex emotions and intelligent arcs. I wish I could mention all of the cast because they were so good, from Joe Keery as high school jock Steve to even the teacher Mr Clarke, each person had a life and character you were invested in.In the end Stranger Things is a really well made original series with some of the best cast, music and writing I've seen in awhile that also has some surprisingly good humour that made laugh out loud. I really hope the series gains traction because I can see the cast and crew going places, as well as a possible season 2.",10
North America,"The detailed re-construction of life in the 1980s is awesome. There are details like Dungeons and Dragons board games and even 80s wallpaper on each set.The children are fantastic actors and there are many throwback hints to the 80s in the whole show, such as even the introduction which is kind of 'Tron-esk'. There are posters that tribute films like Jaws and the Thing, plus news clips from the 80s, even embracing the 'commies' paranoia that was around at that time. It can be watched by children of today, but also by adults who grew up through the 80s who will appreciate it even more. Even though it is set in America, there was obviously an English adviser/crew member as even 'The Smiths' are mentioned and many other 80s throwback memories from life in the UK too. I really hope that there are more episodes, and that 'sea monkeys' and 'gob stoppers' are mentioned in future episodes, along with GI Joe, skateboards and fluorescent mis-matched socks. And don't forget 'Eagle Eyes action figures, where the parachute version resulted in throwing out an action man out the window, only to see the parachute tangle up and end up in a sad tangled mess on the ground lol. In all, an absolute happy tonic to the soul if you grew up through the 80s!",10
North America,"I just finished watching ""Stranger Things"" on a two-day binge. I know, not hard for a series only 8 hours long... but who cares, right? I binge watched it. That meant it was good enough to keep my interest. If it weren't for needing to be up early this morning, I'd have finished it in ONE day.I noticed several negative reviews - on Netflix and on the web in general.Yes, this movie has a whole lot of familiar tropes in it. YES, it hearkens back to the days where everyone knew what ""The Shop"" was. It calls to mind everything from ""E.T. The Extra Terrestrial"", to ""It"", and even - in my eyes - to ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"".And - no - this isn't an alien movie. Not by my book, anyway. This is an all out thrill ride of fun-loving tropes that call us back to the days of slightly more wholesome but still just as terrifying (because many of us were still kids watching movies like ""Poltergeist"", some of us more sensitive than others to those scares or the more minor ones in family friendly movies like ""E.T."") as when we were young kids throwing popcorn into the air because we jumped so high.I know it sounds like something stupid, but those were moments of sincere ENJOYMENT for many of us 80's kids. This movie takes place in the 80's, calls to mind (very deliberately and straight to your face many times) that era... and still manages to keep a modern audience entertained. Now, I don't call for total originality in a story line. I am perfectly fine with the very familiar and been-done concepts that are common horror/fantasy/sci-fi tropes nowadays. As long as it isn't boringly so, I am able to be entertained by something I've seen before in one way or another.This is not quite that movie. It is filled with all those very familiar things ... but it manages to mix them up just right, and lacks many (if not all) of the cringe worthy dialogue and tropes that we know so well from overuse. And... it left it with plenty of closure that could mean trauma from the events in the series will always haunt the characters just as they hopefully will the audience - or that there will be more to come.Dear God... I know a season 2 will probably blow it... but let there be more to come!!!!!!",9
North America,"When a young boy, Will, disappears things start to go wrong. A girl with superpowers appears and a whole crew of bad guys are trying to hunt her down. Who is she? Why are they hunting for her? But that's not all. A monster is there too. It is hunting... That's a bit of a synopsis of the story told in a very vague and short way, but I want to keep it interesting, so hey?The directing of ""Stranger Things"" was mostly done by the Duffer Brothers, as they are credited, AKA Matt Duffer and Ross Duffer. These two directed six episodes. They were really great. At first I didn't think that they could pull it of, directing with the two of them, but after seeing the pilot, I knew that they could. They made every shot look like a piece of art. But of course, this isn't only thanks to them, also thanks to the brilliant cinematographers. They were great at their job. There was only one shot that I think could've looked better and that was the one in the last episode where Hopper looks up with a bit of teary eyes. This shot just looked a bit of to me. I've praisen the Duffer Brothers, but they weren't my favorite directors of the show. This was Shawn Levy. He only directed two episodes, but he did them well. It was barely noticeable that there was a different director, but some of Levys camera movements were just fantastic. With this I don't mean that the Duffer Brothers didn't have some good camera movements. In the last three episodes they were also fantastic. The editing was handled masterfully, but with some flaws. Sometimes I could see a split-second of another shot, where-after the shot really changed. This I could see around two times in total. This doesn't take away the fact that the editing was great. There were some clever cuts in the second last and the last episode, switching between the perspective of Hopper and Wills mom and the kids. This was also very good, this kept you on the edge of your seat and both sides had different pacings which was very interesting. They were both tense full, but on another way. With the kids it was faster paced than with Hopper and Joyce.In contrast to the cgi. This was fine, but noticeable. Well, it was way better than some of the cgi I see in movies nowadays. I think that they could've made it more scary if they used props instead. I can understand why they didn't do that, though. For practical reasons. But let's not forget that this is still a TV-show - even though it looks like a movie most of the time and that's a compliment - and that it's common that TV-shows don't have great cgi. They did also use some great sets, the sets of the Upside Down world were good looking and had a 'scary' feel to them. The soundtrack was superb. I very much liked the songs, as you can see in the title of my review. I used a part that is song a lot in the movie. The songs fitted the theme quiet well.After this I usually discuss the actors, so let's stay in the trend, shall we? The series has a big cast, so I will select some people out of it. First of we have Winowa Ryder as Joyce or Wills mom. She was very good. She had some bad moments, but these flew away quickly. She showed of her emotional side throughout most of the show and at the end a more relaxed side. It was very cool to watch her switch between both. Mike was the leader of the group if I had to pick one. He was played by Finn Wolfhard. As a kid actor he was fantastic, so were the other kid actors (Millie Bobby Brown, Gaten Matarazzo, Caleb McLaughlin) I want to mention Millie in particular because she was the stand-out to me. She was really good. She played the character of Eleven. I also find it impressive that she shaved of her hair, that's very brave for such a young girl. Natalia Dyer played Nancy. She too was great. Charlie Heaton wasn't as good as everyone else, but was still good.The script is also very good. Not just the dialogue but the story and characters as well. Each character has depth or makes an arc, and you care about each single one of them, which makes the series only more tense. Weird hu, Hollywood, that when you care about characters the action scenes are more tense and better? Maybe you should try that for once. The character of Steve surprised me the most. He seemed like a douche, but thanks to fantastic writing I started to like him more and he also changed and became nicer. But the thing that I really want to mention is how quickly the show makes you care about someone. Only in the second episode (the second!) I already was near to crying when Jonathan hung up posters of his brother that he had made. His acting was fantastic at that moment and you could see the grief in his eyes, which is also something good. The ways they show how the people handle the loss of Will. How his mother becomes near insane and Jonathan suppresses. But all characters were great, I just named a few. They were interesting and fun to watch and evolve. The story was also interesting and kept you on the edge of your seat. It was complicated but that was its charm.In the end ""Stranger Things"" was fantastic. I am looking forward to next season. There was superb directing, acting and writing, with some of the best developed characters I've seen in a while.10/10",10
North America,"SPOILERS BRUH -------------When this movie isn't beating it's story line over your head with a bat (4 of the 8 episodes are carbon copies of the kids riding bikes, the girl mashing things with her brain, and the kid communicating with his shrieking mother via electricity), it engages in a mountain of Fan Service, usurped only by this years Star Wars (worst of the 7 made so far, not even close).Much like other Netflix series Orange is the New Black and Love, you either have no care about the characters (the kid is kidnapped in the first scene. there's no connection), or you straight up dislike them.Garbage Level: Dumpster Fire",2
North America,"I haven't seen it all yet, in fact I'm only up to S1 E4. But I can say this- One of the greatest horror stories that I ever read was Dean Koontz's The Door to December. This series so far is following a very similar story line, if not THE story line. Change a few characters around and a few scenes, it is almost the same. I always loved that book, and always wanted to see a movie made of it, and now there is one!Similarities: Weird young girl who was raised in a medical research facility and had no outside contact with the rest of the world. She has supernatural powers. She escaped and is on the run.She is befriended by other kids her age- in the book, she is being helped by her mother and a private investigator.There is an evil creature of some sort- in the book it is a dark shadow- in the movie it is some kind of humanoid figure with no face.The evil creature is killing people.I don't want to say any more just in case it is in fact following the book, because the ending was brilliant!I cant wait to see the end!",10
North America,"I did enjoy this show, but as I'm watching it I noticed quite a few similarities to other movies/books/stories.The first and most obvious is to Poltergeist. Alternate dimension, oowey goowey portal to another dimension, monster in the dimension, kid locked in the house, you get the picture.Next, Steven King's Firestarter. Mother had government experiments done on her with drugs, child born with abilities, big bad government now after the child.Steven King's The Body. Four young friends.Even ET, a little bit.I think that's why they set it in 1983, because that was the height of all these classic tales.",8
North America,"Stranger things was stranger than most of the shows I have watched, and I have watched quite a few of them. The show starts off as a tale of an abduction and melds the paranormal or supernatural to the mix elegantly. It slowly increases the dose of the mystic in time making it part of the show in a flawless manner. The best part of the show me were the kids, brave yet foolish and the laws of friendship they faithfully abide. Winona Ryder as Joyce was a master-stroke, she portrays the vulnerable and living mother with perfection. Each of the characters including the ever-encouraging biology teacher was crafted beautifully. One of my favorite moments if the show was where Joyce talks to El before trying to track will, it is undeniably exquisite. One can notice her love for Will and also the care she takes for a strange child who is trying to help her. One cannot deny the chemistry of the three little machos.All in all it was an awesome show , good script, good dialogues, epic acting and novelty. Hats-off to Duffer Brothers and waiting for season 2.",10
North America,"Stranger Things is really very good, captures all the magic of the 80s and all the nostalgy, but missing something crucial, the music. The music of the 80s, A-ha, Mr. Mister, Cindy Looper, White Snake or something like that, at a certain time only is heard ""Africa"" and the series really came alive in the 80s. The series needs more music known of the 80s, just for this is not excellent.Stranger Things is really very good, captures all the magic of the 80s and all the nostalgy, but missing something crucial, the music.

North America,"OF Watchers;ET ,Goonies,and a bunch of others. I liked the 80s nostalgia they did a good job there..It's refreshing to see a series/movie without everyone hammering away on their apple computer,or talking on their cell phones. A lot of people complain that they getting beaten over the head with the 80s nostalgia.Either they aren't from the 80s,or they missed the part, about it all taking place in the 80s.It's very E.T if E.T was written by Stephen King.Think The watchers, combined with E.T,in human form.The younger kids does and excellent job of portraying 80s kids behavior. Now they might not have it completely nailed,but close enough.Considering it decades before they were ever born. The older kids thought, they fall into the stereotype you often see in every teen movie.Either by bad directing,bad script,or a combination. So nothing really new or impressive there.Winona ryder was good as hysterical mom.She really looked like a mental patientWhat annoyed me the most with the series,was all the stuff that takes place in pitch black darkness, so you don't see a thing.And just have to guess what's going on, based on screams and grunting and shuffling. And don't get me started on all the flashbacks. Telling story in flashbacks,have become so popular these days. It's just a really lazy way of trying to progress the story, most of the times it doesn't work. They could have saved the flashback until the end,when they wrap it all up.All in all I give this 4 for the nostalgia",4
North America,"I gave this a 10 because it really was scary. I do not recommend it for kids because of the content it portrays, behavioral wise, demon-wise and child abuse and animal abuse-wise. I am NOT a fan of Winona Ryder. As a matter of fact, I never watch anything she is in, but when I saw the trailer I decided to watch it anyway. I was very taken aback at how good she was in this. She is obviously more mature and not the dweeb she used to be. As far as kids watching this - it obviously seems to be directed towards the age group the kids are in the movie, but this will give them nightmares. It is a collage of many horror movies put together, including a rip off from my favorite SciFi of all time, Aliens, but still maintains some uniqueness. My favorite character in the movie was the cop, who actually followed up on leads instead of being the lazy, paycheck sucking up bum that he appeared to be in the beginning. OMG, that little girl, ""EL"" has a blood-curdling scream. They can do a lot more with this so I guess there will be a Season 2?",9
North America,"""Stranger Things"" perfectly encapsulates everything I loved about my childhood cinema experiences. There have been plenty of contemporary films that have tried to capture the feel of the 80s and for a long time I didn't know if it was personal bias, lack of fresh ideas, or just a jadedness that comes with adulthood, but none of them ever managed to hit their mark with me. That is until now. I loved stranger things and am not embarrassed to say that I consumed the entire series in less than two days. Think of it as a healthy combination of the Goonies, Explorers, Fire Starter, and E.T. in all their adventurous wonder and you have a nostalgic concoction that works.",10
North America,"There is no reason, in terms of story, for Stranger Things to take place in the '80s. But the '80s atmosphere - the dial phones, the chain smoking, Winona Ryder - are there to clue you in on the inspiration for this movie, which is pretty much every supernatural movie from the 80s with a focus on kids. E.T., Poltergeist, that sort of thing.The wondrous thing is how dead-on this tribute. It's not just the clothes and hair, but the style of acting, the scripting approach, the structure, all hold true to their inspiration. You've got the young nerdy kids, the horny, unsure teenagers, the monster, the mysterious one with the power, the bad science/government people, the conflicted investigator, the tearful mom.You could argue that this entire season is simply a pastiche made up of recycled elements, and I wouldn't disagree, but it really feels less like a copy and more like something of that era, as though the writers had fallen into a coma in 1985, woke up and got to working.While it doesn't have the high style of the Spielberg films that are a primary influence, it does have the likability. The story is consistently engaging and fun, the acting is excellent, and the movie has sufficient laughs and tears to satisfy.",9
North America,"I was a skeptical about another attempt to revive the 80s but ""Stranger Things"" really succeeded in many ways. It has served as a very smart pastiche of many of the films I have watched and loved as a kid in the 80s and - the list is so huge to mention here - as well as homage to Stephen King's works, the most obvious one being It .It is very amusing to see that the authors got to recreate the atmosphere of the 80s and tell a great story that it is still is entertaining and smart and gets you hoping for the next episode.In a way, this is another wonderful work that pertains to the same niche of art of Guardians Of The Galaxy, when the walls disappear and you are completely immersed.",10
North America,"I've now watched the first 4 or 5 eps of this new Netflix orig. mini- series (I think?), and, like the 2011 film ""Super 8"", this really put me in the mind of a lot of things that came out in the late '70s/early '80s, including some of Spielberg's concoctions. At it's heart, it's a missing child case (like ""E.T."" was about a boy dealing with divorce), but the bigger picture seems to involve a whole slew of things- secret government operatives, experimentation, monsters, possibly aliens-??- not sure about that so far, but wow this show keeps you on the edge of your seat!",8
North America,"This is my first review here, if I remember correctly. I wanted to review this series because, well, I haven't watched anything I felt this way about in a long time, and positive reviews call the attention of other people that may watch it, making it be more popular and getting for sure a second season! I watched the full season, 2 episodes per day, and in my opinion the pace of the series was great. I didn't feel bored in any moment, what usually happens to me in most movies and series ( 2 hours can feel like such a long time!). As everyone mentions, if you've enjoyed the goonies, monster squad, ET and in general 80s movies with a little horror in them, you're gonna love this one. Don't expect any pretentious, artsy stuff; it's just fun, like old Spielberg movies, and it's great at being that. BTW, I've been a fan of tales from the crypt, masters of horror, the twilight zone, are you afraid of the dark, etc., what can also give you an idea of why I loved this series so much.",10
North America,"This could have been amazing, could have been really memorable, but it just isn't. These TV series have done so many things right - good cast, good acting, great cinematography, great music, great storytelling, decent dialogues.The plot ruins everything. It's just so incredibly simple and straightforward, it pains me. There's no mystery, no plot twist, it's like riding on a train through a desert. You can predict how all of it is going to end from like episode 2 or 3.I expected so much more, considering how high rated these series are. They could have gone in so many different and interesting ways, but for some reason they chose the story that has been told a billion times. Experiments in a lab open a portal through which monsters come out is so 1980. Oh wait, was that your grand plan? Booooring.",5
North America,"It's okay. We've seen similar premises with Firestarter, Scanners, Minority Report, etc. I binged watched and enjoyed..... however.....every time the three boys came on screen I cringed. Every single scene was them arguing, yelling at each other, shoving each other, insulting each other, over and over and over. No development beyond that. Like whoever wrote those scenes only knew about preteens from watching Goonies. Loved Wynona Ryder and the Police Chief guy. I did enjoy the retro 80s feel of the show. It actually seems like it was made in 1983 at times, and in a good way. Quite honestly if it hadn't been for the bickering kids and teen angst I would have give it 8 stars, but they bothered me that much. Hasn't matched the hype for me but obviously, I'm in the minority with that opinion.",6
North America,"Only two episodes in and it's very apparent that a lot of love went into this show. The casting is blowing me away. The sets are incredible. Just awesomesauce everywhere.They have teens doing at least half of the acting and they come across as so authentic.Winona Ryder is the most recognizable face in Stranger and she is completely immersed in her role. Zero ego, she shines as a single 80s mom in an impossible situation. He emotional performance makes the story come alive.There is a nearly perfect blend of drama, horror, sci-fi, and all balanced by a fun sense of humor. The 80's nostalgia is strong. I hope they borrow a page from American Horror Story and come with different themes for many seasons to come.",10
North America,"Without saying anything about the actual storyline, I can definitely say: WOW, a refreshing new series with an elegant retro feel! It takes you back to the 80's, totally believable. All the equipment, clothes and fashion, cars, music, buildings, etc. are so well chosen and gives the story such an authentic feel. The synthesizer theme song is awesome - it enhances the whole experience, killer! The acting is superb, this includes all ages - even the kids did an amazing job, their work didn't seem forced or faked, and they have amazing chemistry on screen! Great camera angles too.If you like mystery/sci-fi/thriller stories like the X-Files, American Horror story, Super 8, or ET, than this show (which has elements of all these) will surly not disappoint. In fact, I really had no expectations and was totally hooked by the end of the first episode! Looking very forward to the next season and am curious to see how they will develop the plot. I can only hope it doesn't become too predictable - that it still keeps me at the edge of my seat!",10
North America,"Another drawn out never ending series...Everything about it is predictable.Where have the single episode jolting series gone?Having to invest hours upon hours to find out how a show ends(if ever) is getting very old.I've decided to pull the plug after the 2nd episode instead of losing interest halfway through the season like so many others of the same format.The word ""bindge"" in front of any word usually implies a negative thing and its no different with ""bindge watching""",3
North America,"The series is perfect, holds the attention from start to finish. Each episode is well designed, intrigue and surprises the viewer, causing the desire to immediately begin the next stay latent. The script is something to admire, as it is not seen in most current series. Who watches sit within the story, and you can understand perfectly the lashings of the whole plot, despite the suspense is maintained with full logic to the facts presented. The actors give a show and perfectly fulfill the role of convincing the audience. Especially Winona Ryder (Joyce), wronged in the film industry, and dressed the mother of the character of the missing boy, is convincing in every scene, there is no way to excite and cheer for her. Also noteworthy young Millie Brown (Eleven), which surprises the best suspense scenes with his mysterious character. The soundtrack helps take us to the show room and was delicately chosen according to the time when the story takes place. The house opening track perfectly with the art and serves as an appetizer for what lie ahead.In general, the series surprised by the quality, because it is produced by a streaming service company, to escape the current tiresome theme of making remakes or show zombies, superheroes, vampires or police investigation, to bring a sense nostalgic big productions the years 80/90 for children's characters are so prominent in an adult series, and for various other reasons I could spend all day listing here, but invite those who did not attend have this experience, it is very pity brought me back to have interest in series again.",10
North America,"This series is the power of Netflix at its finest! No need for 24 episodes, monster-of-the-week episodes, etc. Just 8 episodes of great storytelling, of a self-contained story, pretty much what anyone wants! Everything is great here, the pacing, the actors are FANTASTIC! the kids are darn impressive especially Eleven! Plus, the way it is filmed is beautiful, giving unusual shots you wouldn't usually see in a TV series. Great music! Yes it's an homage to the 80's cinematography (and music and games), but it's an original story in this world of remakes, sequels, etc. I hope this series is a great commercial success and will convince Netflix to keep going that way and giving unusual projects a shot. If you're a fan of sci-fi, fantasy, horror or the 80's or none of the above watch this! My brother is not in the least interested by any of that stuff, can't fathom what Dungeons & Dragons is about and was hooked on this series. Way to go Netflix",10
North America,"Watching this TV series was like eating a beautiful looking plate of food and then puking your guts out.It started out great. Excellent retro feel and cinematography, promising premise and story line, and a wonderful cast. And then it all went to hell.Things moved along nicely out of the gate and then all of a sudden scenes became contrived and unbelievable. It then hit the wall and was just plain stupid in every way. I was actually screaming at the TV and also very upset for wasting my time in the first place.More specifically, the rapid-fire switching from scene to scene to I guess create more action was amateur hour. The insertion of slow and meaningless scenes to offer contrast to faster moving scenes was obvious, in a very bad way. They then throw in the constant flashbacks interrupting the flow in a most annoying manner. The only way I could get through it was by fast-forwarding through most of the scenes.In the end, the only audience that could possible appreciate this garbage would be kids under the age of 10. Such a waste too given the premise, cinematography and cast. The directors and producers should be ashamed because if this was done by competent people it could have been brilliant.",3
North America,"Absolutely fantastic! Brilliant cast. The young child actors all deserve huge praise. One maybe a little more in Millie Brown. This is a talent you don't see often. Flawless would be an understatement. Winona Ryder shows her acting chops have only gotten better with age. Amen to the Duffer Brothers. The directing , writing, music and cinematography are all on the money. This show relates to all ages which is pretty rare to find these days. Stranger Things provides you with just enough laughter yet pulses on the horror/drama aspect to perfection. Now this is a way to bring back the 80s. Anybody who likes good television don't hesitate to order Netflix immediately. Besides you're already missing out on House of Cards & Bloodline.Z",9
North America,"Stranger Things is a story about these kids/people who experience the great unknown. Except they seem to know awfully lot about it because convenience. In fact, the writing is so convenient that it often becomes annoying and destroys the immersion. People said Lucy was a bad movie because pseudo-science. Time to put some salt in my bathtub and enter the shadow world to make sure! After all, that's what the science teacher said and omg it twerks!! This is called asspullery.Originality wise this is nothing original. Execution nor the character are nothing special either. Stranger Things is a very typical title from the mystery genre, but it came out in a good time, especially for those who see their series on Netflix. Every series is now about politics, lawyers, superheroes or superhero lawyers who fight against politicians. Stranger Things is not fresh, but it is good change and might even seem original when comparing to our other titles. Some call it the nostalgia train, but I guess some people are getting those vibes from the new Ghostbusters too, so yeah.The characters can basically be put into two groups: ""kids who are too smart"" and ""adults who didn't listen."" We also have under-casted cop who acts too well, save- the-day Mary Sue alien and bad Fonzie who can't keep himself out from the screen. You can basically forget every one of them in a month and few years later wonder ""hmm where have I see this fella before?"" when they randomly get casted on a movie/series you end up watching. The baddies were also really shallow in this. One-dimensional to the max. I wonder if they could have covered it better in a movie.I am still not sure why exactly I liked the series despite all the mediocrity. I guess you could say it did good job capturing the atmosphere. But still it often end up ruining it with character flaws. The mystery seemed quite interesting after the start, so it did manage to take me with it. First 2 episodes were bad and the conclusion was meh. In fact, the conclusion was so unoriginal that it alone made me drop the score from 6/10 to 5/10.There is some nice songs in the OST. I end up listening them afterwards too. Well, the series is over now. Time to move on and leave it among the hundreds of other titles that were as entertaining.edit: update 11/11/17 - I have now finished S02 and it was a solid 8/10. My opinion on S01 hasn't changed.",5
North America,"More than Spielberg, this show is closer to earlier Stephen King (""the Body"" and ""It"", to name but a few), in style and in spirit.Strange things are happening in the small town of Hawkins, Indiana. When a young boy disappears, a group of misfits, of young kids and teenagers, together with a paranoid mother and a Sheriff with a traumatic past, stumbled upon a government conspiracy involving psychic manipulation and experimental parallel worlds. And in the process of rescuing the vanished kid, sanity will be questioned, friendship tested, teenage angst overcame. In other words, all the elements of a 80s genre masterpiece were safely in place. Simple but likable.The sets and production design very accurately recreate the air of the 80s classics which the series clearly draw its inspiration from. Special mention must be made to the acting. Nostalgic without overly clichéd, the characters were all very well-written and portrayed, true to their 80s inspirations in an innocently unpretentious manner. Unlike other genre efforts to ride the nostalgia bandwagon which most often ending up parodying their sources, this series treats its inspirations as genuine and organic, rather than just a phony commemorative exercise.After a promising start, the story came to a satisfying conclusion after a 8-episodes season. As a standalone season with just a few loose ends to be tied up, this is an overall quality, sometimes amazing show which deserves to be seen and appreciated by the general audience.",10
North America,"I really enjoyed this Netflix series. It did take watching thru the 4th episode to finally stop finding all the comparisons to previous movies and start telling an original story.Examples: Opening episode music/The Knick - Location/Twin Pines - Kids on Bikes/E.T. - Nerdy kids in club/Goonies - Backlight/every Spielberg movie - Main kid's little sister with blonde pigtails (even though the rest of the family has dark hair/E.T. - Finding strange thing that can elevate things/E.T - Strange things haircut/Minority Report - Strange thing put in water to get information/Minority report - Communicating thru lights/Close Encounters - mom who talks to the lights - log lady in Twin Peaks - kid's walking on railroad tracks/Stand By Me - missing kid communicating thru walkie talkie/Dark Skies.I know you can find comparisons in every movie, but this series had so many in the first few episode that turned into a game. That said, once it became an original story I really enjoyed it. The actors are all great. Usually not a Winona Ryder fan, but she really won me over in this role.",7
North America,"I watched it all last weekend, yawning, strangely enough, or often waiting to hurry up and finish the damn thing. Stephen King highly recommended it, but it rips him and others off so thoroughly, that although it usually isn't downright boring, it certainly never thrills or sends a tingle down your spine with anything approaching cinematic ingenuity. Even the cinematography is dull. King also praised Wynona Ryder. What?? She spends the entire series squealing unsympathetically like a twiggy near-hag twit. The black kid, whose last name is McLaughlin (please give it back, kid), should never act again, and I found Matthew Modine's hair more disturbing than anything else in this silliness. Fun? If you don't like thrills, laughs, scares or surprises from your sci-fi horror, I guess. C-",5
North America,". . .and not just because I miss the 80s. Here's a little town with a big secret - and potentially a big problem. And, of course, the government is involved. A cult is developing for the show at my workplace, and everyone has his/her own descriptors for what it reminds them of. It's like a mashup of Stephen King, John Carpenter,James Patterson, David Lynch, X-Files, and more than a soupcon of Twilight Zone. The acting is amazing, especially the children's, but Winona Ryder and David Harbour are fabulous as the adult leads. The 80s vibe is authentic. I only wish Roddy McDowell was still here and able to be in it. I have my fingers crossed all the way up to the elbows that AMC renews it for another season. If you like sci-fi or paranormal, you have to see this show. You will believe.Wow, IMDb, do you know how hard it is to write 10 lines that contain no spoilers? If I didn't reallllllly want to promote the show, I'd have just eased on down the line.",10
North America,"Yet another good Netflix production. This is a 10 stars out of 10. After watching the first 30 minutes I was hooked. I ended up watching the first season in one stretch. This series is a mix of Dean Koontz and Stephen King set in the late 70s. If you like to be scared, do like I did and watch it at night in the dark. I jumped out of bed and turned on the lights a few times. Not really suitable for kids unless they are accustomed to watch scary movies. No profanity that I can remember and no nudity. One short love scene that shows less than some TV commercials. The story line and suspense will keep you on the edge of your seat. Looking forward to next season. Perhaps eleven will be back... It is certainly set-up that way. Good job Netflix!",10
North America,"this is the best TV Series I ever watched. It gives you many feelings and I can't really explain in letters what feelings I got with the character eleven and the other 3 boys, my favorite is the toothless kid he's pretty smart and he's swearing really gives a funny yet perfect character to him and yes in the story it's in the 90's which my favorite part because everyone likes old school right? and how they used the 90's songs in the story really matches and gives a perfectness and much more I can't explain it in letters so you better just watch this :) and best part about movies and these kind of TV series is that it's fun because you can get feelings that you can't actually get usually. and it's like FightClub LetMeIn those kind of old movies gave me emotion and feelings and made me think and gave me many feelings. sorry for the many ""feeling"" sentence but you might understand me once you watch this TV series.-should I stay or should I go~ :)",9
North America,"if there aren't so many holes.I enjoy this series, but not sure if I like it. So far I don't really want to re-watch any episode.The good side of this series is the acting and casting. Teenagers look like teenagers, not 20-ish supper models like in other series (""scream"" for example). And acting is simply great, not the ""reading from a book"" type.But there is not one single likable character, at least not in my opinions, which make it hard to follow the story.El is great, both character and actress. Only one thing that I didn't know she was a girl when she first showed up. She has an almost shaved head, her chest is flat and she's wearing hospital outfit. Her face doesn't look very feminine, it's kind of ""neutral""but in combination of hair style and clothing, people would have thought she was a boy. Yet everybody meets her instantly knows she's a girl.The boys acting is, again, great. But their dialogues are a bit too mature for their age. Sure kids can be serious, but not adult- serious. The writer needs to go to a school and watch how children play and communicate.The crazy mother is, well, a crazy mother who believes a flashing lamp is her son's signal, and yet doesn't believe he's dead. Normally in this case people will think of spirit, ghost...not another dimension, especially when they're living in the 80s. Why doesn't she believe her son is dead? Why does she believe he's trying to communicate with her in the first place, right the first time seeing the light flash? There should be more, like the silhouette of her son or something.The supposed to be lovely innocent good girl, like in all other horror series, is OK at first. Then turns to be just like the other hotties in other series: a walking flower with no brain so that the boys in the series have a reason to follow her and kneel at her feet. Everything she does is wrong, from forcing her friend to a party and then ignore her, to going to the wood alone with another guy when she already has a boyfriend...At least the hotties in other series are actually hotties. The fact that she isn't up to Hollywood beauty is what attracted me at first, I actually thought she and her boyfriend were a cute couple, but then they ruin her character.And yes the creepy boyfriend. He in fact is one of the more believable characters. But yet, he's creepy and is made to be hated. I couldn't like him.The weirdo she follows into the wood with also falls in this category. His character's behaviors make sense, but he's not a character to like, at least not now.Anyway, the first season of this series worth a shot, just don't expect too much.",5
North America,"So much potential at the start. Romantic 80's well replicated with moody synth reminiscent of b-grade horror sci-fi. A well picked cast downtrodden heartfelt nerdy kids + others. Thing is, the dialogue, story telling and production quality began a rapid downward spiral. The end result was little more than color by numbers entertainment which I began to skip through to find the paranormal bits. Afterwards the series as a whole this left me an absent feeling wondering ""why?"" Did something happened which sap the passion out of the production. Some kind of derivative art vampire? The cause of the decline in production quality for me holds much more intrigue than the forced mystery this series suggests it is attempting to convey.",3
North America,"I've finally decided to write my first review, because I think the reviews of Stranger Things need to be balanced a bit from someone who doesn't think it's way up there with all the 8, 9, 10 star reviews.Stranger Things opens just great. During the first half of the first episode I was really impressed by the look and feel of the show, and the story just brought me in. They nailed the 80'ies feeling quite well. The intro and music feels very authentic (although in shining HD). One of my favorite things was that they've toned the actors down to look less like movie stars, and more like ""regular"" people like you or I. The look of most 80'ies homages feel a lot less authentic than Stranger Things, where you feel that they've only just added enough of an 80'ies style to get away with it, but it still feels like everything's been modified enough to feel modern. Stranger Things avoids this and that's a very good thing.Now, for the story, I don't think it quite held up all the way through. I found myself losing interest after a few episodes. In my opinion, they gave away too much, too soon. The mystery disappears after a while, and over time the show started feeling more like a low-budget show. The direction of the show also felt somewhat all over the place. The story is told mostly through the eyes of kids, but there's enough violence and scary parts that I don't think kids are the target audience. Like, for example, The Walking Dead, it's violent and horror-y in a way that's toned down just enough to feel safe and PG and I found that quite distracting. I get a strong Super 8 vibe from this show, but it feels less consistent in what audience it's really trying to appeal to. Obviously, this show has turned out to appeal to most of you, so my opinion is probably not all that common, which is one of the reasons I felt I should write this review.The acting is decent most of the time. I don't think it'll win any awards or anything, but it doesn't distract, with a couple of exceptions. Winona Ryder feels surprisingly misplaced and I had expected a lot more from her. I didn't really like the acting of Charlie Heaton either, but I suppose it could have been a matter of directing as well. All of the characters are somewhat cliché, which I don't think is a problem. Actually, I think that's what they have been aiming for. This is a homage to 80'ies horror and I think it's a good choice that the characters are the typical characters you find in those old films.Got to mention again: the intro, wow! I love it. It's incredibly good looking and it sets a great mood immediately.I gave this a pretty average score, on the low side, because of two things. One: The script. It lost my interest over time. In the long run, it didn't keep the mystery that the opening episode promised going. Two: it was very unclear to me who this was aimed to appeal to. It feels very matinée in quite a few sequences, but I think the target audience is supposed to be adults.Anyway, I didn't hate it, and as I'm not one of those guys that raves about it or totally hates it, I tried to be a bit more nuanced in my review. But I'm very certain that I won't be seeing this again, and I think that in a year or so, this will be a show that I have pretty much forgotten about.",5
North America,"Wow this brings me back. The Duffer Bro really nailed it with these series. Everything is extremely well thought out to make it a perfect 80's, Steven King experience. from the clothing to to the camera work, the build up of suspense and the music...aaahh the music. Loved it. Only minor downsides are the use of CG instead of maybe Stan Winstond's puppets and the fact it's in HD and not VHS quality ;) I'm definitely going to watch this again on a old tube if I can find one by the trash some where! Really looking forward to season 2! Oh and don't change anything for the next season please. Keep the style and everything intact.",10
North America,"SpoilerI thought this was going to be an original Netflix series, however I watched the first three episodes and they are just stealing ideas from E.T., Starman, Poltergeist, and Carrie.Surely, there can be some more creative ideas out there, can't there?I was waiting for the Titanic II to sail and sink in Lake Michigan, ha ha. Maybe that happens later in the series.On the other hand, my wife loves it and continues to watch it.I also noticed that the writer changed in Episode 3, but it didn't change the stealing of ideas.",1
North America,"Stranger Things are what television and movies used to be about. Imagination, fun, mystery, suspense, a dash of comedy. Before youth was force fed Marvel Comic adaptation after adaptation after reboot after remake after sequel, there was seriously good, quality material to sink your chops into.Thank goodness for Netflix because without them, ""Stranger Things"" would never have gotten made. I'm so glad it did. This was a tour de Force of filmmaking, with stellar performances by Winona Ryder, Millie Bobby Brown and a wonderfully eccentric cast of beloved misfits you embrace from the first episode. You will hear a lot of people compare it to classic 80's films The Goonies, but it's less like those films and more like what would have been created by the Masterful 80's filmmakers that created the flicks that became iconic.This series demonstrates with unapologetic glory what entertainment could be if we allowed more original content into our sphere, rather than the regurgitations and comic saturation that obliterated the blockbuster and dumbed it down to the IQ of a gnat. This is why we remember the 80's films so fondly. They were better.Star Wars was a film that changed the industry, much thanks to the young pioneer George Lucas. Following him through that gate of genius was Steven Spielberg, Robert Zemekis, Ron Howard and so many artists with stories to tell. The Duffer Brothers are a hugely welcome, long overdue addition to that club, and so is their series, ""Stranger things.""Packed with nods to yesteryear cinema, it never has to rely on sex, drugs and exploding cars to pull you in, but instead grips you with a brilliant storyline and powerful performances. It lets you have fun again, without beating you over the head with the common ""Look how much money we spent"" plague.I hope for a second series. There is no question, this is full of tomorrows biggest stars, especially Millie Bobby Brown whose turn here is mind blowing. Emmy should hand them their awards now.",10
North America,"Stranger things starts off strong with its moody cinematography and nostalgic references to 1980 pop culture. After about the 5'th episode the story, acting, visuals kind of get bland. I also noticed an increasing amount of plot holes as if the writers were running out of ideas on how to tie it all together into 8 episodes, it just felt rushed near the end and really cheesy. I literally had to skip past several scenes because they were like nails on a chalk board (Spoiler Start *** where Mike was talking to El about how he wants her to live with him and his mom will be like her mom and they will be happy and yada yada, ignoring the fact that a disgusting demon monster with a venus flytrap for a head is in the room right next to them, then a few minutes later they continue on talking about ""after this is all over"", like umm hello? you are being stalked by a demon monster straight out of silent hill and you wanna talk about how she can eat ego waffles and other good food and sleep in her own bed. Way to sabotage your own scene by eliminating any remaining sense of suspense and horror. Spoiler End ***) I did enjoy the series for the most part and was mostly entertained so It deserves at least a 6/10, probably even 6.5. If season 2 carries on in the direction the first season was going then the the next thing heading into the upside down will be the positive ratings.",6
North America,"""Stranger Things"" is quite an anomaly in today's overly saturated market of media crap and thin drama - and a good one. The 80s are for children what the early 60s were for young men, the ""decade du jour"" of all things good and valuable: friendship, character building, fantasy, adventure, learning the facts and pains of life without overprotective parents and eyes constantly gazing at iPhones. It was also the high point of the second golden age of cinema, when George Lucas and Spielberg were kings and the highly emotional rollercoasters fun films were the norm - and special effects were meant to dazzle and tell a fantastic story, and not distract us.It's a particular sentiment of comprehensible nostalgia that has been attempted to be ""captured"" and ""reproduced"" before by J.J. Abrahams: ""Super 8"" comes to mind again and again when seeing ""Stranger Things"". It's like watching a craftsman building a vintage car from scratch: it's the same thing, and at the same time, it is most certainly not. All of the elements are there, complete with slowly fading credits with film scratch marks, but it's impossible to avoid seeing the modern touches of editing, lightning, CGI, and the eventual winks to the audience that this is a period piece (which is particularly painful for those, including myself, who have lived in that era).""Stranger Things"" borrows from it all: apart from the obvious ""Super 8"", there's bits and pieces of ""ET"", ""The Thing"", ""The Goonies"", ""Fire Starter"", ""Akira"", and even some nuances of ""Neon Genesis Evangelion's"" Rei Ayanami on Eleven's speech and behavior. Sometimes it fails, being a ""paint by the numbers"" replication of those formulas, leaving plot holes and thin characterizations behind like a trail of bread crumbs leading you to what media produces today for the millennial audience unaccustomed with plot and emotion. On some times, it succeeds going beyond that level and portraying an engaging story that invites you to look beyond the clichés and enjoy this series for what it is.All in all, ""Stranger Things"" can be truly recommended, is a guilt pleasure of the most extraordinary kind, and rarely you will find a moment where, albeit flaws, you are not enjoying it.",6
North America,"The constant presence of Carpenter's bloodthirsty monster, the Spielberg-esque children-vs-monsters-while-the-government-is-chasing- them story, and the 1980s vibe synth-pop are the base ingredients for this fun, gripping TV show. Nicely done characters in set of the 80s with synth-pop is already a good sign for a great show, top it with brilliant atmosphere, fantastic special effects and David Harbour (who does a really good job as the local chief officer) and you get the best show of the summer! I recommend it to everyone who loved 'The Goonies', 'The Thing', 'E.T.', and loved to play 'Half-Life'. You all going to enjoy this fantastic piece of web series!",10
North America,this was the best show ever IF YALL NEED AN EXTRA PERSON I'm here i have been in drama since fourth grade and now I'm in 7th and still doing it I'm 13 and this is her grandson Gavin. the last episode was sad cause something happened but 11 she was legit and she was pretty lit and everyone else was so awesome i don't spoil the shows put have a another season if y'all need anyone I'm here for the job but this show was pretty cool so yea thanks for the amazing show everyone of ya'll did an amazing job picking out who they want but i'm not rating this a 10 more like a 20 cause they did an excellent job doing this show please have another season come on because i was sad because there was only 1 season. hold up there is a lot of people being still w.righter is not stupid at all are world has turned into evil but everyone is amazing for real .,10
North America,"Stranger Things has got to be one of the most majestic and intriguing shows I have ever watched. After the first episode you'll be sucked into the small town of Hawkins in 1980s Indiana, where the atmosphere and overall scenery is impeccable.What blew me away the most was the acting, usually when I see child actors in a show I immediately think the quality of acting will be less than great but I was so wrong in this case. From the get go it is very obvious that these kids are insanely talented. Dustin is one of the most likable characters I've come across in a T.V. show or movie and Eleven is just....unbelievable.The plot is so rich and full of secrets, but it is not one of those shows that just continually leaves its viewers in the dark - you get flashbacks and all sorts of good stuff that bring the unknowns of the plot to life.This show is so good that it caused me to write this review and create an IMDb account AND I have a midterm in 4 hours!Do yourself a massive favour and watch Stranger Things ASAP.Patrick",10
North America,"After two people from two different circles with vastly different viewing preferences recommended this show to me, I bumped it up a few slots on my To Watch List.... ... and promptly binge-watched the entire first season.What makes it so addictive:1. Great characters you can empathise with I have stopped watching many TV shows for lack of likable protagonists, but the ensemble in Stranger Things is interesting and well-rounded, yet the information on each character isn't divulged immediately. I felt like I was getting to know the characters better from episode to episode, and each minute sucked me deeper into this world. I couldn't stop because I wanted to know first and foremost how the characters' journeys would go on.2. Great child actors Because seriously, where did they find these kids?3. Slow-build mystery The show takes its time to unveil the mystery - and it manages to maintain a sense of suspense while doing so! At least for me :)4. The cinematography I was born in the 90s, so I can't judge how 'true' the 80s feel of this show was, but the visual of it was amazing. If you value cinematography porn, you'll definitely enjoy Stranger Things!Why I don't want to re-watch it immediately:The great thing about mysteries is not knowing what's going on or how it will end. While I was unable to stop watching the first time around, now that I've lived through it I don't feel the need to re-watch it. That's the only reason it didn't get ten stars (okay, that and the heteronormativity).",8
North America,"It is one of those series, which starts with ""just enough"" steam to pique viewers' curiosity, slowly unfolding with details that fit in to explain the bits of the fast beginning.It is a great sci-fi watch for kids, adults alike; with good acting from lead roles (Hopper and Joyce), and a bunch of kids who happen to have a way of their own for solving problems in the adults' world.there's enough sci-fi, teenage crush, kids' silly lingo, monsters that we don't understand, telekinetic booyah moments in this show to keep you hooked through the series.I hope the next season develops more interesting facets to the seemingly already told story.",7
North America,"I wholeheartedly believe this is one of the best TV shows in recent years - maybe even of the decade. Season 1 felt more like a long, drawn out, excellent movie than an ordinary series, and this can be attributed to many reasons.Visually, ""Stranger Things"" is stunning. The production value and cinematography are the best, unlike any other I'd ever seen in a TV show. Normally the contrast of visuals between a show and a movie is clearly apparent - usually because of budget and staff - but such is not the case here; one could play an episode marked as part of a movie and no one would be the wiser. There's also of course, the 80s homage feel that is conspicuously displayed in most of the scenes. To many, it serves as an item of nostalgia or a reminiscence of similar classic 80s movies.But even though 'the 80s feeling' seems to be the focus of many people when watching the show, I sense that they forget to look at the other aspects that makes ""Stranger Things"" great. One of those aspects is the characters. All of them play some part or role in the movie, and they all have profound personalities. As the story progresses each of the sets of characters make their own developments to solving the conflict, and the way they were able to eventually intertwine their efforts was a satisfying inclusion. Even the child actors were able to pull off very convincing and pretty strong characters.This is a show that can easily have you finding yourself suspend disbelief and feel the story come to life, despite the very otherworldly premise. It's funny how greatly it makes you long for a misadventure with your friends as kids. Overall, the way the sequence of events build up, the way the plot unravels to the impending climax, the way the mysteries keep you glued to the screen, the way the magical soundtrack takes you back in time and the way the experience finally comes to a powerful conclusion and wraps up in a fashion that very few TV shows can imitate, makes ""Stranger Things"" an evoking installment that perhaps only good movies are.",10
North America,"I don't want to ruin the party but i guess people are not picky anymore. Not just movies, life in general. They just eat what is given to them. And they don't complain, they ask for more. I guess quality doesn't mean much anymore... ""Stranger Things"" is not the worst TV show. The general atmosphere and the cast are pretty good but it's one of those shows with the obvious and now tiring, Hollywood recipe ! Poor screenplay (story already seen a million times), good actors but poor dialogues (not well written at all), and Winona Ryder... Oh my god, she is just moaning and crying the entire show. I guess Stranger Things hits nostalgic people in the heart but come on, be honest, we are far from Spielberg, Zemeckis, Lucas... the worst is yet to come, as we're gonna get Season two ! Oh my God, you can sense they don't even know where they're going.",5
North America,"Stranger Things is a mash up of Sci-Fi horror that feels fresh in the resulting tale. If you're wondering what it's like, very topically, it's like The X-Files without any UFOs told, largely, from a kid's point of view. The child actors in the story are all excellent and the adult interaction is there too. You'll be attached to the cast and there's even the requisite bad folks too, all in addition to a nasty monster. It's an out-there story much like Steven King meets John Carpenter so, in spite of it's crazy nature it has a good quality which propels it nicely.The kids here just nail it. That wide-eyed ""anything's possible"" ethos is front and center. They make it fun to watch this story because they're so natural and lovable. They meet an exceptional girl simply called ""11"" due to her nature of being a product of some strange government experimentation resulting in, for lack of any other term, superpowers. She's certainly been damaged in the process and after just one episode you won't be able to imagine this crucial role being better portrayed than by the young actress Millie Bobby Brown. She's incredible in her fragility and broken youth. The other youngsters are just as good and all deserve high accolades. Then there's the adults of whom David Harbour, the town police chief, builds an important bond with the viewer. In his own loss he's become a bit of a loose cannon mess. He's about to go too far in his life and job when the small Hawkins community suddenly goes him a few better. He's the first one to sense a sinister government is behind the high-strangeness making his character one the viewer will latch on to and fully get behind.I'd say a wild story like this could have easily gone off the rails, but it never does. The Duffer Brothers who wrote and guided it deserve much credit as I'm sure it wasn't easy finding the mix of young actors/actresses to properly pull it off. They nailed it all around. It feels like a quality big-budget movie instead of just another Sci-Fi mini-series. If you like both Steven King and The X-Files I would practically guarantee you'll find Stranger Things right to your liking. Even fleshed out at eight episodes it's definitely good enough to go another season if the writing and acting levels are sustained.",8
North America,"When Netflix showed me the trailer for this series, I immediately knew I was going to like it. I absolutely adored the movie Super 8, and this felt like a nod to that with a few variations.Stranger Things did not disappoint. From the very beginning, we were sucked into it with a tense opening scene that set the stage for what sort of series this was going to be. We're introduced to the characters one by one, in a way that makes us understand that each of them is going to eventually play a role in the outworking of the plot. I initially thought that Hopper was going to be a character that I disliked, but that wasn't the case. He was human and flawed, and I loved how his backstory was revealed little by little, up until the last episode, when we saw the culmination of what made him into the man that he was. I thought Winona Ryder did brilliantly as a strained, anxious, just-a-little-shy-of-emotionally-unstable mother of a lost child. And all of the kids were phenomenal in their roles, but I especially appreciated Millie Bobby Brown's performance as El/Eleven. She didn't have much dialogue, and most of her acting was done with her body language, her eyes, and her facial expressions, and it was absolutely brilliant.There were jump scares, which are to be expected in any movie of the thriller/horror genre, but I felt like they were tastefully done. The series wasn't saturated with them, and there was always a nice, tense buildup to them. The scenes with the monster in them were always delightfully terrifying, even the ones where you couldn't quite see yet what it looked like. I also loved the idea of an ""Upside Down"", and I thought it was neatly executed.I'm really hoping we get a second season of this, because there are so many questions I have that I'm hoping are answered. In the last scene of the last episode, we see quite a few of these unsolved mysteries: Will still being infected with whatever held him hostage in the Upside Down, the truth of Eleven's whereabouts after she kills the monster (also where that monster came from and whether or not there are other monsters out there), what happens to the Hawkins Laboratory and how will they deal with the open doors to the Upside Down, whether or not Terry will ever find out about her daughter, and most importantly, will Nancy stay with Steve or will she go with Jonathan? :) The one thing I felt could have been done differently was Barbara. I felt she got a raw deal, and I wish they had made her survive her time in the Upside Down, too. Other than that, I thought it was a great series, and I will definitely be watching it again in the near future.",10
North America,"The Goonies meets the X-Files with an 80s soundtrack. Love it! When I first saw the ratings for this movie, I didn't know what to expect. I can't remember the last time I saw a 9.2 for anything on IMDb. It's fair to say that I was slightly sceptical.I thought, anything with a 9.2 has to at least be worth a watch. I was not disappointed. Not only was it worth watching, but I now realise why it has a 9.2.My rating is 10 out of 10, simply because I have not seen a series in this genre that has been it's equal in the past 10 years. It really was that good. They knocked this one out of the park.Would I like to see a second series? Not really, I think it finished really well. I will however be waiting with great anticipation for the next project the Duffer Brothers take on.I also have to mention the actors and actresses involved in this project, especially the child actors, really terrific job. They really brought this to life and sucked you into the whole story.Extremely impressed and to anyone who is thinking of watching it, I would definitely suggest giving it a try.",10
North America,"Alright Netflix, you really have to cool it with these original series. I mean, for the most part they've been exceptional…I've enjoyed most of Orange is the New Black, laughed out loud at Lady Dynamite and had my love of super hero fiction rejuvenated thanks to Daredevil and Jessica Jones, but I haven't fallen so heavily in love with a show like I have with Stranger Things in a really long time. This brief, eight episode sci-fi series had me glued to my television, begging for more at the end of each hour, and I am absolutely devastated that it's over. This series - seemingly out of nowhere - managed to do so many things so incredibly well that it was, quite honestly, staggering, and my only complaint is that it felt like it was over too soon. From the terrific acting to the truly engaging plot, Stranger Things not only stands out as maybe the best original content out of Netflix to date, but one of the best new series in quite some time.The crux of Stranger Things' narrative is the young Will Byres (Noah Schnapp) going missing in the small town of Hawkins. After his disappearance, locals in the town - namely the boy's mother, Joyce (Winona Ryder) and his three friends - begin to notice strange goings on. Electrical interferences, paranormal activity and shadowy government cover ups…that sort of thing. Over the course of the first few episodes, Will's friends meet a young government lab escapee who has been dubbed 'Eleven' (Millie Bobby Brown), El for short, who demonstrates some curious abilities. She can manipulate things with her mind, and is able to communicate with people between different dimensions. Being that she escaped from a government facility though, she is being hunted by a team of g-men and comes to rely on the group of boys, specifically Mike (Finn Wolfhard) for her safety.Of course this is just a broad overview of what is one of the most well thought out plots in a sci-fi series to date. Stranger Things goes places, and is paced incredibly well. There is exactly the right level of push and pull. Just as a question is answered, two more take its place. While this might sound tedious, it's all handled impeccably, and you never feel cheapened by the string of mystery leading you through the different characters' lives and interactions. Which is another area that Stranger Things excels.I never once stopped being impressed by the acting in Stranger Things. Winona Ryder is great as the frazzled mom going out of her mind with concern for her missing son, and David Harbour is outstanding as the towns police chief who sticks his nose where it doesn't belong, but the real stand out performances come from the four kids. Wolfhard, Brown, Matarazzo and Mclaughlin are talented beyond their years, and they positively steal the show. Wolfhard and Brown in particular work off each other undeniably well, and show more on-screen chemistry than actors ten years their senior. I could go on about the relationship between Mike and Eleven, but in the interest of remaining mostly spoiler-free, take my word for it, it's powerful, emotional, adorable and up there with some of the most stellar acting I've seen from anyone, regardless of age.From the get go, Stranger Things wears its influences on its sleeve. It's a love letter to shows like Twin Peaks and horror fiction like the writings of Steven King. The score is dripping with a synthesized sound reminiscent of the music of John Carpenter. There's even some nods to the audience in the form of posters for movies like Evil Dead adorning walls, or characters watching Carpenter's The Thing. It does so much to let the viewer know that it's aware of where it comes from, and that it's okay with that. It rather masterfully uses tropes that we're familiar with from these other series and films as jumping off points to create its own story and universe. Stranger Things is pieces of so many things without ever becoming too much of something else. It's so much of Steven Spielberg, Steven King, David Lynch, Freaks and Geeks, but it's more than the sum of its parts. It's a wonderfully acted trip descent into the world of government cover-ups. It's a truly believable and heartwarming friendship between kids that come from completely different worlds. It's an inter-dimensional horror series complete with terrifying creature design. More than that, it's a brilliant combination of the three, and one of the most thoroughly enjoyable experiences I've ever had watching a season of television start to finish. The second season has a lot to live up to, and the cynic in me has a hard time believing that lightning has a chance of striking twice, but hey, stranger things have happened.",10
North America,"First problem i had with this show was why make it a period piece? I felt like it was trying to say to me THIS was how E.T. should have been done. Later i realized that it wasn't (necessarily) meant to compete with E.T., they just wanted to make a script that didn't have to allow for cell phones, car computers, etc. They should have been more careful with the script, tho'...too much modern-day slang kinda grated on me.Next problem i had was with the teenage sex scene. It just didn't really seem appropriate In a show where prepubescents were the stars, and presumably the audience.Next, the pacing felt odd to me, as did the character development, and the plot revelations.On the other hand, this show does have all the necessary elements for both fantasy and horror, and if nothing about it happens to bug you, you should enjoy it greatly.For me, however, Netflix original productions still need very good sci-fi and fantasy epics to complete their collection.Please don't think of this as a bad review; I'm spoiled, this is the golden age of shows...and a series i would have been wild over 10 years ago, is only slightly better than mediocre with the current levels of competition.",6
North America,"Stranger Things is cool, but ultimately disappointing. Though I love 80's horror and sci-fi as much as the next weirdo, I feel like if you're going to invoke such a loud stylistic lexicon you need to bring something new to the table, something of your own to balance the appropriation and allusion.The first episode is intense, dense with promises of captivating plots to be revealed. All the 80's elements are there, and handled so well, I am giddy with anticipation—where will this show take me? The 80's horror vibe is so well captured I feel it can't be all there is; a show so fluent in this language must surely do something interesting with it. The rules and conventions of the genre are established in such a way as to convince me they will be played with or broken.Alas. This show is as by the book as they come. As the narrative unfolds, the horror I feel most is, first, a suspicion, which slowly blooms into realization—the 80's mashup pastiche angle is sort of all there is. Some of the characters are engaging, and there is some fine acting, sure, particularly from the young Millie Bobbie Brown, as well as David Harbour, and, at times, Winona Ryder, but it is not enough to save the greater whole; this show does not transcend the shadow cast by its titanic genealogy.In addition to heavy Stephen King, Steven Spielberg, and John Carpenter influences, other appropriated/allusive elements which deserve mention include: some watered-down Akira as the basis for Eleven's character/premise/backstory; an errant MK ULTRA namedrop; a sensory deprivation tank a la Altered States; shots (of Eleven in the ""upside down"") which look remarkably similar to some of those found in 2013's Under the Skin; a figure coming out of a wall as in the Frighteners... the list could probably go on.Some of these ideas and elements might have worked if they weren't so flagrantly underdeveloped.I was ready to like this show. I wanted to like it. I even tried to convince myself I liked it. People seem to enjoy it for the 80's throwbacks; I feel there is nothing else to it. Stranger Things invokes the style of the classics as if to count itself among them, but it plainly is not. I find it utterly forgettable.If you are interested in contemporary work made using this vocabulary, and want something which does more than rearrange existing pieces, I would recommend It Follows, a movie every bit as good as the classics of the genre it draws from.",6
North America,"Netflix really bought an excellent product, it took me directly thirty years ago. Good soundtrack, nice photography. Dungeons and dragons was the first nostalgic memory. The show is full of good 80's references.I never heard the Duffer Brothers name, but this time they really did it. I liked your work pretty much. Winona Ryder and David Harbour were good... but the kids were awesome, Finn, Millie, Gaten and Caleb... Kudos!Goonies, Super 8, ET, all together. An nice adventure, with mystery, love and friendship that you must watch.I enjoyed it a lot. Can't wait for season 2.",9
North America,"This show was the highest caliber production I've ever seen, the only show that could possibly come close in quality is Game of Thrones. Netfix have played an absolute blinder. It feels like a long Spielberg movie.Stranger things has a phenomenal cast, especially the child actors. Its the best Netflix original by a long way. Eleven and Hopper are the stand out characters for me, both of them are going to go very very far in their careers. Winona Ryder was as always top notch. The bond between the child actors was visible and reading up on it, the Duffer Brothers worked hard on them becoming friends before-hand, which adds to the over all effect. I thoroughly enjoyed every bit of this, its mind-blowingly good and the sound track is 10/10. WELL DONE NETFLIX. LOVE/LOVE/LOVE.",10
North America,My first review you all. I promise I will get better. Stranger Things first season 8 episodes of pure dream like bliss. A series that deserves its high ratings. It brings back so many memories of similar contented movies from the past but still has you guessing. Netflix is producing some talented shows. The duffer brothers have some serious skills. The setting is perfect and all the cast play out well. I could only fault the series once as like all shows its not perfect but I do believe that's how movie and TV shows of the Eighties rolled. I could give you a list of movies that this show reminds me of. I think in all honesty if you have read a Steven King Novel or especially a Dean Koontz novel you will drift of in a dream like state and be hooked from the first episode. The only time you will be disappointed is when the end credits role at Episode 8 because you will be wanting more. The sights and sounds of a time past come back to life. Enjoy.,10
North America,"This show is not horrible, but I feel it is an insult to every writer of every 80's hit movie or show of which this current series rips off and they are not being credited and paid for whatever success 'Stranger Things' might achieve.It's almost like the writers were smart enough to pick up on all the winning plot lines of 30 years ago, throw them in a bag and then stitch this story together and because it is playing to the nostalgia of every 80's kid, they are getting unwarranted standing ovations for their barely not plagiarized storytelling. Throw in some 80's stars a la Wynona Rider ( I keep waiting for Wynona *Poltergeist Diane* to tell her son *poltergiest Carolanne* to run to the light)and Matthew Modine to make the potion complete and everyone is under some strange love spell. It's the worst kind of Hollywood emotional blackmail.I was even looking forward to seeing Wynona in this but she's just OTT with the acting and now I wish she would join Drew Barrymore, Tom Cruise and Kevin Costner for some acting classes that would not only benefit them but possibly make our having to watch them bearable.It's goonies meets x-files meets poltergeist meets e.t. meets alien meets stand by me etc etc etcIt's unfortunate the writers could not have been more original with 'their' ideas.",5
North America,"I can't thank a friend of mine enough for recommending ""Stranger Things"" on Netflix!! My life is richer for having seeing this gem of a series. It is perfection -- a real labor of love that pays homage to the Sci-fi, suspense, and horror genres that we all enjoyed from the '80s. The story line, writing, acting, characterizations, and score are brilliant beyond belief. And David Harbour (who played the minor, but memorable role of Randall Malone for Ang Lee in ""Brokeback Mountain"") is a revelation. I see him as the next Harrison Ford -- he certainly could play Ford's son (kind of sounds like him, too). Watch this if you haven't!!!",10
North America,"One of the best series I've seen this year. Full of good adventures, the best of some 80 films. The series makes you remember why live one of your best moments with your group of friends. It makes part of experiences, danger and mystery that slowly resolved. Undoubtedly a series full of magic, which is here to stay and that many already expect its second season.Netflix series tells the story of four children immersed in a web of suspense and terror, complemented by monsters, parallel dimensions and many analog devices. The popularity of the series has grown exponentially since it was launched in mid-July, delighting audiences around the world. In Latin America it became an instant success and the young cast was immediately elevated to the rank of major Hollywood stars.",10
North America,"This series ticked all the boxes for me, and I can't praise it (or creative geniuses that are the Duffer brothers) highly enough. It's like they took everything you love about movies, TV shows, and books from the 1980's, mashed them all together, added their own origin spin on things, and came up with perfection. The setting is late 1983, and everything from the clothing right down to the toys, feels as if you are really watching something filmed back then – well except the picture and sound are 2016 quality thank god! Genre wise, it's pretty much a mix of everything – sci-fi, horror, supernatural, mystery, fantasy, romance, drama, coming-of-age, and comedy, meaning there's something in there for everyone to enjoy. I wouldn't class it as a family series, but I think that if your kids can make it through the Harry Potter movies without being terrified, then this show would be about the same level of scariness.The acting is flawless, particularly from the young cast. Because of this you instantly grow to love (and care about what happens to) all the characters, from the moment they appear on screen. As a long term fan of Winona Ryder, I had no doubt that she'd be fantastic, and she didn't disappoint. Both the soundtrack (Peter Gabriel, Toto, Foreigner, New Order, and The Clash to name a few), as well as the original musical score (think John Carpenter's Halloween) composed by Kyle Dixon and Michael Stein are superb.Think I'll go and watch it again. 10/10.",10
North America,"I had heard good things about it and decided to watch a few minutes of the first episode earlier this week. After 4 full episodes I decided to call it a night, yes it's that good.If I had to find negatives about it I'd have to say that there are a few minor science mistakes like when one of the kids is following his compass that he's mounted right on a walkie-talkie near the speaker that has a magnet on it. Other than that the acting was magnificent, specially by Millie Bobby Brown that deserves an Emmy for her role as Eleven. Seriously she is a prodigal child actor that I'm already looking forwards to seeing in other productions much like I'm looking forwards to seeing more of Jacob Tremblay.And then there's the soundtrack. Candy for the ears, not quite as good as the soundtrack from Turbo Kid (incredible) but not far off.",10
North America,"Oh boy!!! What can I possibly say about this fantastic show that no one else already has. Murder, mystery, suspense, thriller, horror, comedy, action, drama, sci-fi etc all beautifully wrapped up in a perfect 80's theme. It is Christmas come early on Netflix with this show. Every character in this show is spot on, and the kids especially are fabulous. They are the real stars in the show, and the way they are portrayed epitomises everything that was brilliant about the 80's.You will want to root for them till the very end as they bring out the kid in you as well. The dialogues are really good and the suspense keeps you at the edge of your seats. I absolutely adore the theme music and the musical score throughout the show is spot on as well. This show is a must watch for absolutely everyone of all tastes, and it really deserves all the praise. Spread the word that stranger things are definitely happening.",10
North America,"I loved Stranger Things to the core ! For a series with just 8 episodes and 1 season under the belt, this turned out to be a creepy, spine chilling yet compelling original series. The Duffer brothers who took the helm for Stranger things absolutely nailed it with their creative and self assured way of story telling. Every episode kept me on the edge and i simply could not muster myself to wait for the another day to finish it off.Winona Ryder, David Harbour and the five kids around whom the story revolved were all perfect for the role and the acting from their side was top notch! The casting team, the background score team and the special effects team, all did an amazing job. I chipped off 1 vote out of 10 for the slowness introduced into the story with the side story covering Natalia Dyer's character.I hope that whoever signs off these originals for Netflix gets a pay-raise soon. You simply cannot stumble upon Sense 8, Gotham, Daredevil, Master of None et all without having the sort of talent that he/she has.",9
North America,"From the show's opening sequence, Stranger Things already showed promise. The chase in the Hawkins National Laboratory, the game of Dungeons & Dragons, and the disappearance of Will, showed to me that the show will have it's fun moments, but it can also turn dark and ominous & that's what it turned out to be throughout the series.The story revolves around a group of young friends, an unnerved mother, a fellow policeman and a mysterious young girl who are on a journey to find Will, who at first was presumed to be dead. However, when they realize his death was fake, they 'venture together through an alternate universe, fight an alien-like monster, and unravel the secrets of the government.The show does a great job with keeping a constant and smooth plot. After you finish an episode, it leaves you wanting more.Overall, I think this series is one of Netflix's greatest original shows. It's almost difficult to find any flaws. (9/10)(P.S, the intro theme is fantastic! it had an amazing 80's vibe.)",9
North America,"Stranger Things follows a group of people within a small town who go looking for a young boy who has gone missing and ultimately realize that there's more to the mystery then they initially thought.Some of the mystery elements were pretty good, and I watched the first season because I was curious and mostly interested. It had it's moments of cool stuff, but that was maybe once every second episode.The show advertises itself as a horror, yet it fails to be scary. There was not a single moment at any point during season one did I feel even slightly unsettled or scared. It's more of a sci-mystery, but even then it's not that good. It lacks a substantial amount of originality, from the design of the monster to the presentation of the plot. Nothing about this show is special.Another thing is just the amount of flaws in the show. There were multiple points where I had several questions about how certain things happened. For example, at one point two characters are in the forest together. Let's call them 1 and 2 to avoid confusion. 1 finds something almost as soon as they get into the forest and calls out to 2, but he's nowhere in sight. So what, did 2 just sprint off in one direction? Did he put in earbuds and start listening to some heavy metal or something? Did he leave the forest? Then, 1 goes off somewhere on her own, 2 magically returns, not out of breath or anything (so he clearly didn't sprint off somewhere) and not wearing earbuds either, and he can suddenly hear 1 from a place totally opposite the forest. Again, no spoilers, but somehow 2 hears 1 from that place. And even if you try to argue that 2 has bad hearing, in an earlier episode he hears a scream loud and clear from the other side of that very same forest. It just doesn't make sense. Some of you will call this a nitpick, but it stood out so blatantly to me that I couldn't help but address it. And besides, I can only ignore so many nitpicks before it becomes a problem and I have to start docking points.The acting, please kill me, is awful. The children are horrendous. They're expressionless, character-less actors who have no talent. At one point two characters are arguing and one kid looks like he's about to fall asleep as he yells at the other character. That, or he's stoned out of his mind. Sure, he's underage, but that doesn't seem to stop kids. On top of that, Winona Ryder attempts to pull off the insane mother role, and it's clear that she's trying to be great, but she's not. I don't think Winona Ryder isn't talented, but she didn't pull off the performance she seemed to be trying to. Everyone else was pretty flat too, at least if they were important they were.The characters these actors portray are even worse. They're unbelievably flat and boring. Each one can easily be described in a single sentence.The show tries to make it look like it came out in the 80s, but its gets to be annoying with how hard it tries. It shoves all this 80s crap into every scene, and it feels like the Duffer Brothers are ramming all their 80s computers down our throats and movie posters up our butts. I think the conversation the Duffers had before the show was in their attic, surrounded by the stuff of their youth, and started like this: ""Hey bro, what should we do with all this stuff from the 80s?"" ""Let's make a TV show"" ""Oh yeah, that's a great idea. But how will we get someone to produce it?"" ""Oh, we can just get Netflix to do it. They'll eat up anything, so long as they can make a couple bucks. Quantity over quality, like they always say"" Furthermore, the 80s thing sacrifices a level of quality even. The first thing was a personal issue, not an actual flaw really. This is though. The CGI is awful. Painful even. Now I know, ""It's trying to look like it was made in the 80s"" but I don't care. The show proves that it knows what practical effects are, and whenever it decides to use those it looks great. But I can think of only a handful of times where it actually did that. So why didn't it use practical effects all the time? I don't know. It's stupid, though, that's for sure.And the writing, oh boy. It ranged from okay to awful to flat out not making sense. And what's funny is that I think some of the actors knew that, specifically the main child actor. His delivery was so bad sometimes I wondered if it was on purpose. Like he knew that the writing was awful and was pushing the limits as much as he could to see how poorly he could act without the director noticing. Just for fun, I guess.One more big flaw: the soundtrack. It switches between this repetitive, boring, and frankly annoying sound/noise and ill-suited songs. Seriously, none of the songs have any place in the show. At least not at the points they were used.Overall Stranger Things sucks. Yet like I said, it was, for the most part, good enough to keep me watching it until the end. Will I watch the other seasons if there are more? Not a chance. At gun point, maybe. But not of my own free will. I don't get why people love this show so much, but if you do then go right ahead. Obviously I'm either missing something or I'm just not as easily impressed as most people or something. I don't know, but I don't really care. In the end I would not recommend this show.",7
North America,"Had a hard time sitting through the first episode and skipped through scenes in order to not bore myself to death and still see what the story is about.*next paragraphs contains mild spoilers*As a sci-fi adventure lover I gave this series a chance even though I loathe horror type stories. I do not enjoy it when they try to scare me with monsters which is probably the biggest reason why this show did not perk my interest. But it was not the only reason.The first scene I had to skip through was the two teenagers bickering about nonsense. The guy pushing the girl to spend time with him while she wanted to do schoolwork. How could such vain dialogue interest anyone? The second scene I had to skip through was the mother yelling hysterically at the cop while he was trying to type up the report. I don't enjoy looking at women yelling while waiting on the plot to progress but having to listen to it is just unbearable. How do people enjoy sitting through a scene like that for entertainment purposes?*end of spoiler part*I noticed many dialogues did not add any real value to the story line and were just inserted as scene fillers or standard, unoriginal character building.All in all most scenes were pretty standard story line protocol, not very creative and therefore just too predictable.",7
North America,"SPOILERS GALOREI was predisposed to like this show. I wish Hollywood produced genre movies as good as the 80s classics, such as Aliens, The Terminator, The Lost Boys, you name it. I played D&D when I was younger. Midway through the first episode, I had high hopes.But the cracks started to form fairly quickly. I kept watching, hoping that it might get better. Eventually, I got to the point where I knew that it wouldn't, but I wanted to see how bad the ending was.Now come the spoilers. I can't really tell you how flawed this series is without getting to the final episode.There was not a single surprise. To say that this show was predictable was an understatement.The acting ranged from OK to awful. Winona Ryder's googly-eyed mania was painful to watch. The best actor in the show was the young girl who played Eleven. Her quiet expressions made some scenes more interesting to watch than they would have been otherwise.Some of the mysteries of the series never see resolution. For example, how did Will communicate through the lights? Especially if, when you're in the Upside Down, you can't perceive the world on the other side?The series was too long. At least a couple of episodes consisted mostly of people walking around, driving around, going here to there without the story advancing anywhere. A two-hour movie could have told this story.The monster wasn't that interesting. Better that we never saw it fully. Also, how does an apex predator survive in a lifeless world? Just wondering. Of course, when the series runs for several hours, you have time to ponder these questions.Here's another one: How did the bad guys' MAJESTIC 12 base operate in a completely undetected fashion? Did dozens of people live on the base, with no contact with the outside world, for years? Be that as it may, they were stunningly inept, to the point of hilarity.And the end really wasn't the end. The chief bad guy might not be dead. The monster might not be dead. Eleven isn't dead. The young boy who goes missing in the beginning is coughing up alien slugs, but doesn't tell his parents. No resolution of any plot point, in a cheap bid for another season. (Note to the writers: Why not just start another plot, as other series have done?)A big disappointment, from someone who was ready for something good.",2
North America,"I immensely enjoyed some aspects of this show but other aspects really drug it down. For one, the sound quality is horrible. Some scenes I have to have the TV turned up all the way to even half understand what is being said but then suddenly and without warning everything gets much much louder. It was not a minor annoyance and gets this at least a full star lower rating. I suspect that they do this in an attempt to startle viewers, which is not acceptable considering I had to strain to hear some dialog. Another thing I did not like is the original music scoring, which came off like an '80s B movie soundtrack (think- the Halloween 3). I also found the fact that they could not get away from '90s through present scare tactics (scenes where they try to startle the viewer instead of doing something more subtle that might instill real fear in the viewers- this actually seems to be a lost art). I also feel that certain characters did things that were extremely unproductive in regards to successfully accomplishing anything. Over all I enjoyed this but am only giving it 5 stars because of how badly they messed up aspects that could have easily been fixed.",5
North America,"I've been struggling to find a decent TV show that would hopefully keep my attention during the entire episode since The Walking Dead is on a lengthy hiatus(kaslfj!!!jdsak!!!). Anyway, I saw the trailer and thought it seemed promising. Turns out, I wasn't mistaken. The acting is excellent and more than believable. The child actors should be applauded and praised heavily. They are just amazing. It has a bit of everything: horror, suspense, thriller, supernatural and the things invaluable, such as: friendship, society, family. I haven't seen the whole season yet but I'm on it as I write. I just needed people to know that YES, it is worth it. Just try it. You've got nothing to lose, just gain.",10
North America,"Glacially-paced show plays like 30-year-old Spielberg outtakes – without the fun and charm. Cliché characters and scenes right from Close Encounters, E.T., and Goonies. And Poltergeist too. A Jaws poster hanging in a kid's bedroom is a nod to the show's vintage roots – and a scene that follows soon after. (Come on down here and chum some of this sh**!) The premise has got more than a little of Stephen King's It.Every cliché in the book is here: the d**chebag boyfriend and idiot friends, the cute virginal girl who is coming of age and her geeky big-boned friend, the Goonies-like tweens and the bullies that persecute them, the creepy introvert, the slow sheriff who grew up in town, and the a**hole G-Men. It's deja vu all over again – in not a good way.Winona Ryder's shrill, hysterical, nicotine-addicted mom grates on my nerves like nails on a chalkboard.Millie Bobby Brown, who was so cute in Intruders, is going to be a huge star very soon.It's great to see Matthew Modine. When did he turn 90?Add a star if you like 80s hair styles and pop culture.",3
North America,"This series was a great mixture of several genres done in a style similar to horror and sci-fi movies from the eighties. It didn't quite hook me right away, but because it was so talked about, I kept on going. I'm glad I finished it, because the payoff was worth it. I think every episode had at least one moment that made me think of E.T. I also thought it had a similar feel to an old show called Tales From The Darkside--strange things were going on, but it didn't quite cross completely into horror territory. My favorite characters were Eleven-- of course--and Dustin. The whole thing just made me want to ride my bike around my old neighborhood and play Dungeons and Dragons all night long. It was pretty special, and I didn't just enjoy it--I'm thankful for it.",7
North America,"Never saw it coming.The first time I read the synopsis I was like ""who wants to watch some 80's style show with some kids and cheesy sci-fi nonsense""How wrong I was!I'm hooked.It's beautifully shot and paced, the kids are great, and story telling is compelling.Another winner from Netflix.I heard there will be Season 2, looking forward to it.The score is nice too - brings back some memories.Watch it!",10
North America,"I've seen all the episodes of Daredevil, House of Cards, Master of None, Narcos, and several other of Netflix's brilliant shows. This is definitely the best one to date. It's scary from time to time, but it's still scarier than 99% of horror movies that come out in theaters these days. All of the actors--including the young kid actors and the adult actors--are brilliant and give outstanding performances. Literally each one of them could be nominated for an Emmy. The fact that they're all unknown actors (save for Winona Ryder) adds to the mysteriousness of the show, and their chemistry and dialogue is spot-on. There's nothing predictable about Stranger Things--each episode had something happen that I never would've predicted. Most shows have moments where you can pretty much guess what's going to happen at certain parts, but NEVER in this show. Once I started the first episode, I ended up binge- watching the rest of the season in one weekend, which is the shortest period of time it ever took me to watch a single show. Really looking forward to season 2!",10
North America,"OK, so I never understood why people on IMDb or wherever else would need any detailed description of a movie before watching it. For me it was always - worthy or not worthy trying. So all I'm gonna say is: it's worthy. Worthy as hell. Just do yourself a favor and watch it. You won't regret it.But, as IMDb requires 10 lines of text for a review, I'll add it has unique value for people born before the era of smartphones and goddamned Pokemons. It's very nice to watch people living in a still analog world, in a moment when computers are just going to enter our lives. Not that I have anything against computers, I was born in 1979 and enjoyed Atari, Amiga and PC very much, but this show just takes you to your very childhood if you were born somewhere between 1970 and 1980.Once again - watch it.",10
North America,"The cast? Amazing! Every single actor seem to be perfect in his/her role...you start wondering, are they acting or they really live it? The kids are all great in their acting with the leading girl being breathtaking. She expresses all kind of emotions without to even talk.The director did excellent job, everything is balanced, nothing is out of proportion, every scene is giving you all range of feelings and makes you attached to the characters.The story is simple and yet complicated, sci-fi and yet is touching every day human problems and behaviors....I just love it...I wish there is a second season!",10
North America,"Love that show. Love the intro music. Very 1980's. It has suspense, a good story line, and a great cast. All the actors are credible and look like everyday people, which makes the show more real.I am not a big fan of shows when kids are the main characters, but "" stranger things "" really took me by surprise.The only flaw would be Mrs Wynona Ryder. A very mediocre actress, if you ask me, with a lot of dry cries for a mother who just lost her favorite son.Anyway, I am looking forward season 2. Thank you Netflix for those great shows.",8
North America,"Location, Location, Location. Well if you are going to create a replica of an 80's movie going experience why not shoot in the exact same location as Spielberg shot E.T.? Does any one notice David's House? The Shed? The Search? It's not an homage it's a dead shot location of E.T. and I was wondering why it was so familiar? Perhaps because I've seen it before? Check out shots in David's bedroom, the closet, the bunk beds, the search with the flashlight, it is the same location and lighting for E.T. It's a replica, and the clothes have the same effort. The kids vest and bikes and other details if you know ET. Well done. No harm no foul, just wondering why it was familiar beyond the 80's?",9
North America,"It inevitably seems a little silly to pile on the accolades for ""Stranger Things,"" Netflix's well-crafted long-form horror/mystery/adventure TV show, but I can't really help myself.It didn't take long after getting into the first episode to sense what seemed like ""Stranger Things"" main set of cues: JJ Abrams' well done homage to '70s-'80s era Steven Spielberg sci-fi/alien movies, ""Super 8.""There are a number of similarities between ""Stranger Things"" and ""Super 8"": A cluster of really tight male best friends; a central activity that they focus on (D&D vs. Movie-making), a small Midwestern town, a sheriff, a girl, and a vast government conspiracy that involves a supernatural monster.Stylistically they're also not that different, but where ""Super 8"" wasn't really allowed because of time constraints to expound as deeply on its thematic elements, ""Stranger Themes"" as kind of a long-form TV novel, has room to range on its big themes: the '80s, the supernatural, horror elements (though not overdone), and crazy government experiments and conspiracies gone awry. ""Stranger Things"" also focuses more tightly on the darker supernatural ""horror"" elements, but in a manner that is much softer than the ""torture porn""-type intensity of today's horror films (though intense horror films have been around since at least the '70s of course). If anything it seems comparatively tame.The first season story arc without giving too much away is about peeling away the onion, so to speak, of the real goings on of a secret government lab - yep - just outside of town. Matthew Modine plays a charismatic, shadowy central role as the lab's head. As the series moves along we learn more and more about the lab and what's really going on there. The disappearance of Will Byers - one of the members of this cluster of friends - in the first episode opens a series of questions that have to be answered throughout the story to find what - or who - happened to young Will.All the actors are quite good - young and old, but David Harbour as the small-town sheriff with a past Jim Hopper is certainly the best in terms of total characterization. Winona Ryder as the somewhat crazed and manic mother of Will and older brother Jonathan who loses her son to - no one really knows yet - is a good fit. Her voice and mannerisms work well for a mother that is on the frayed edges of sanity after losing her son to forces that seem too bizarre to reconcile with anything remotely resembling normal circumstances.The cast of young boys are all great, with the lispy friend Dustin played by Gaten Mattazaro as the most stand-out and lovable loyal live-and-die friend of the group. Millie Brown as the escaped lab patient ""Eleven"" is also fantastic in her own way and has very pure acting instincts. If she stays with it as a career, it should be a long one for such a young and precociously gifted actor.It's hard to talk about the strength of the story and general plot without giving too much away. Suffice it to say ""Stranger Things"" follows a fairly predictable plot, mixing together ample government conspiracies with darkly supernatural elements and, perhaps best of all, a monster from a creepy parallel universe temporarily attached to our present reality.The '80s synth intro and even neon-like lettering of the series title was a seductive draw for children of the '80s like me (well I was born in 1970 but obviously grew up in the '80s too). It seems clear the creators played on this bit of nostalgia without getting too heavy-handed about it - there's ample pop culture references throughout. Ultimately the story, direction, and characters shine and their ability to maintain a strong story line and focus that sucks you in from one episode to the next (yes, we binge-watched it in 2 sittings over 2 days) is typical of modern streaming TV series that I enjoy like ""Stranger Things,"" ""Longmire,"" and ""Bosch."" (among others).Like a good book, ""Stranger Things"" is hard to put down. If for some crazy reason you haven't seen it, you will certainly enjoy it.",10
North America,"There are homages, and there are homages so committed that they become practically indistinguishable from the original works.""Stranger Things"" definitely belongs in the second category. The Netflix drama, which debuted last month, has won many praise for its success on a creepy throwback tale. Set in 1983, about missing children and extraordinary goings-on in an outwardly average small town. The setting and themes will be immediately familiar to anyone once besotted with that decade's master pop storytellers, Steven Spielberg and Stephen King — a cohort that clearly includes the series creators, the twin brothers Matt and Ross Duffer.Filled with a sense of wonder and awe from the cinematic era of the 1980s, Stranger Things delivers a surprisingly refreshing simple plot and storytelling, enriched by it's keen performances - mainly its child stars - and pacing, which contributes on the delivery of what will feel like an amazingly entertaining 8-hour movie.""Stranger Things"" reminds us of a time marked by a kind of no- strings escapism. And as it does so, we find ourselves yearning for it because the Duffers have made it so irresistibly appealing. There may be other equally great shows to watch this summer, but I guarantee you won't have more fun watching any of them than you will watching ""Stranger Things.""",10
North America,"THIS SHOW IS AMAZING. There are so many amazing actors and actresses which all deliver Oscar worthy performances, combining that with the mind-blowing plot the writers have given us this is a must see. The characters are believable, and grounded in reality and yet when something Supernatural happens, they try to solve the mystery but the actors do it in such a way that you BELIEVE that this could be really happening. I really liked how they just tease you with the small bits and then at the end they just go and give you everything they have, which was just amazing.They made some very good casting choices and the kid actors were surprisingly possibly the best part of this.",10
North America,"Netflixes original content of late I've personally found a little disappointing so was a little dubious about this series and wasn't really planning on watching it anytime soon, but yesterday couldn't find anything to watch so decided to give it a try with my expectations a little low,. After the first 20 minutes I was hooked and done something I rarely do and binged my way through the whole series.It's not without its flaws, the characters from the government provably the biggest as they all seem very flat and under developed, CGI is a little ropey at times and a few actors on occasion go a little soapy with their acting. But all of this can be forgiven for how genuinely brilliant the show is. It's taken everything what was wonderful about 80's family adventure flicks and rolled it into one.Winona Ryder, Natalia Dyer and all the child actors for me steal the whole show, the soundtrack and score were top notch, but what really impressed me was through all 8 episodes there was no filler scenes every single minute of the show added to the story or character development.Truly top notch and if it doesn't go on to win awards it would be a travesty.",9

There may be other equally great shows to watch , but I guarantee you won't have more fun watching any of them than you will watching Stranger Things.",9
North America,"Let's get it out of the way: yes, it's not perfect. There are some special effects that don't look so special. Few details here and there, for sure. Original? Not quite. But this is a 10. It cannot be less than a 10.First of all, it's pure nostalgia. The bikes, the clothes, the music, the board games; the vibe of that era is all there. Make no mistake, the main character of this series is not 011 – it's the 80's.The casting is stellar – everyone, but specially 011, shine on screen. The direction, the photography, the pace – everything just works. And nothing feels like filler.It takes something special to have Stephen King and Guillermo del Toro praise it. Believe us; it is.By the time of this writing, Netflix is yet to confirm S2. Even if it doesn't come, this was a breath of fresh air to television (it's not really television, but you know what I mean.)",7
North America,"Stranger Things Episode 1No spoilers, since the title is The Vanishing of Will Byers. So a kid goes missing, and this whole town is searching for him. Stranger things are happening all around and no one is mentioning it.To best describe this show is to mash up The Goonies meets Akira. At least that's the vibe I'm getting so far, one episode in. The writing and direction in this Netflix show is so much better than the Duffer brother's other work: namely Wayward Pines. Though now, I have Hidden on my queue so that I can see a better example of their work.Joyce, Byers, played by Winona Ryder is the first listed on the cast, but from the first episode she was over-acting. I know a mom is suppose to be hysterical when a child goes missing, but her performance wasn't believable. Hopefully in the later episodes she does better. Maybe my expectations out of Ryder are too high.David Horbour plays Jim Hopper, you might remember him from Black Mass, but really he plays minor roles. He's a bit hit or miss when it comes to his performance in the first episode. He has some great strides but acting is a marathon.The kids in this show are perfect. There isn't anything wrong with their acting or delivery. They feel real even if it's set over 40 years ago. Their child performance is on par with The Goonies, Harry Potter, Stand by Me, or ET. The teenagers on the other hand are worse. I mean annoyingly worse. You're gonna be bored or exhausted watching their subplot.Verdit: Worth watching more episodes. Between the story and acting I will be finishing the first season.",8
North America,"If you're like me, who doesn't enjoy watching horror movies or series and doesn't want to have sleepless nights, this might be the perfect mix for you!""Stranger Things"" really does something special: Yes it scares you and sometimes even shocks you, but it doesn't try to lure you into a trap and then bite your head off.I'm on IMDb since 15 years and this is my first review, because I really had some kind unique experience. I actually feel like somebody cared for me while watching. Why? Because when I got scared, there were some nice or funny scenes afterwards to cheer me up again. It's like a roller-coaster: You can relax on the easy parts and you will get thrilled on the way down. There might be parts that you would have liked a bit different. But in the end you'll get out with a smile and want to ride again.What really made the difference for me: I could fully engage with what was happening and that's what I'm normally not doing when things get scary. ""Stranger Things"" delivered the perfect amount of thrill to keep me on my toes, but it also gave me enough room to relax and think. It is trustworthy and honest.Why 9 out of 10? Some things around the main plot were a bit illogical for me. And some cuts were odd. Normally, I don't pay attention to things like that. But there were some scenes, where the cuts were obviously off (different facial expression in camera scenes, different postures in different scenes).But both points didn't spoil the great experience. If you think that you might be a bit like me, go for it! You won't regret it.",9
North America,"Stranger Things is Netflix's latest original series to hit the network. From everything I've seen that has the Netflix stamp on it, I'm yet to be disappointed. With that and great reviews of this series, I was really excited to finally get into Stranger Things and check it out for myself.Like most Netflix series, they are designed to be binged, and Stranger Things is no different. This 8 episode series plays like a movie. While it has no reflection of the quality of the show itself, I think it's a massive credit to the writers and directors to make this seamless series feel like an 8 hour movie. Unfortunately I was unable to watch it all back to back, with the longest session being the final 4 episodes. However with it only being 8 episodes, this is a series you can easily re-watch in the space of a day. And for me, this is one I'm going to watch this one a few times over.Stranger Things is at the heart a mystery/thriller/horror series. Plot wise, when I was watching it I thought it had an Insidious feel. Without going deep into plot points, if your a fan of the Insidious franchise than you will be completely onboard with the plot line in this series. The whole time you are watching it you are trying to work out what is actually going on. I went into this series completely blind from trailers and synopsis so everything to me was a big mystery. I know at this point it may have been hard to skip all this stuff but I you can, I heavily suggest you go in as blind as you possible can.Again without giving too much away, I thought the main cast were fantastic. I thought everyone nailed their role that all played into the final bigger picture. Everyone from Winona Ryder as the mother, David Harbour as the chef and Matthew Modine as a mystery scientist. For me though, a big credit to the child actors throughout this series, especially Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven. I thought she played the mysterious role better than anyone else in the series. What made her performance so great was that for the most part, she didn't say much, but when she did, she spoke it with a sense of naivety and unawareness that her character is portrayed as. On a side note Dustin was by far my favourite character. For the most part he was the comedic relief of all the tense sense and I thought Gaten Matarazzo handled the role perfectly.For many people, the biggest appeal of this series is the 80s feel. Even though I was born in the 90s, watching this series heavily reminded me of the feel I got as a kid when I watched those 80s movies such as ET. From what I've heard from people who had their childhood based in the 80s, the way the child cast is portrayed as they typical 80s kids is spot on. For me personally I saw the connection between the kids in Stranger Things and those in ET. On a side note, my favourite thing they did to set the tone of the 80s was the opening credits. Everything from the font to the music felt completely 80s. I'm not sure if the opening credits was filmed on film but the way the text never say flush and the white flickers that is typical in film really set the tone of what the series would be.Stranger Things is one of those rare series that once you sink you teeth into it, your hooked. I thought it was a great all round story that had a big sense of start, middle, end that we typically find in movies. It's really hard to pin point anything specifically that I didn't like about this series apart from not being able to watch it all in one day and not growing up in the 80s to allow me to completely relate to the nostalgia and characters of the series. I think if I grew up in the 80s this would of been a home run but because I at times struggled with that connection, it feel a bit short.9/10",9
North America,"I do not understand the hype with this show. Perfect material for a teenage night get-together to watch some cheap horror. The acting is terrible - especially that Nancy girl - every time she comes up I just cringe. The story-line is ridiculously slow and juvenile themed. If you are a high school-er or younger this might be acceptable entertainment, as I see the target viewing market for this a crowd between 12 and 18 years of age maximum. There is not much depth on the adult characters and their interaction - even Winona is only seen screaming and not much else is explored about her persona. It would have been nice to have seen more scenes with the kids parents, or more filming inside the police station...adult interaction in general. Stay away from this, do not believe the hype. I just wasted a few hours I will never get back.",4
North America,"My wife and I watched this on Netflix streaming over 4 different viewing sessions, one or two episodes each time. Overall it is very entertaining although I don't share the lofty (9.2) IMDb rating.Set in the 1980s it appears to be inspired by ""The Montauk Project: Experiments in Time"" by Preston B. Nichols and Peter Moon, regarding supposed time travel experiments at the Montauk Air Force Base at the eastern tip of Long Island as part of the Montauk Project. A ""time tunnel"" was created and alien monsters traveled through it to menace the locals.Here Winona Ryder is Joyce Byers, single mother of two sons, one about 17 and the other about 11. A strange girl (Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven) shows up and the 4 young boys who are close friends take her in and hide her. It is clear that she is different and we find she has escaped from the top-secret experimental lab. She also has extra-normal powers.David Harbour is good as the local police chief Jim Hopper. He is instrumental in helping uncover all the secret activity and find Joyce's missing son.The movie contains lots of paranormal activity. When her son goes missing, we find into what they referred to as the ""upside down world"", Joyce is able to communicate with him through light flickers, even though she doesn't know where he is. he is actually very close to her but they can't see or hear each other directly.The ending sets it up for a continuation.Update September 2019: We dropped our Netflix subscription, I object to the heavy emphasis they put on what I consider ""trashy"" programming. So I was able to get season #2 on BluRay from my local library. My wife and I watched the first 3 episode and just weren't motivated to keep watching more. Not that it isn't good, for the right audience, we just no longer felt it was worth our attention and time, compared to all the other things we might want to watch. To us there was neither an interesting storyline or interesting characters to draw us in.",7
North America,"When it comes down to 'Stranger Things' I'm in a bit of a conundrum. Never before has a show managed to hit all elements of what people value as entertainment. This TV Show has humor, it has horror, it has mystery, it has one hell of a soundtrack, it has many moments of nostalgia, it has amazing acting (especially from the younger cast which is a nice change), it has amazing visuals, it has sad moments as well as shocking ones -but most of all it has heart. There is a theme of love that's evident across the shows run, whether it's the persistent love Joyce Byers has for her son that allows her to keep on searching for him against all odds or the love of friendship that causes our three protagonists to put themselves in danger in order to be reunited with their friend. The last scene says it all but also the connection and the undefinable love between Mike and Eleven.Also, credit to the writers for creating such interesting characters. Each one felt they had deserved their screen time. Hopper again is brilliant as we never really know his motives but we again root for his happiness. Nancy's story-line felt too separate at the start but it really blended in well with the story and gave the viewers a taste of adolescent life during the 80s. It was nice to see such empowering female leads – each one felt strong and determined but no more than the real highlight of the show, Eleven. The character of Eleven is probably one of the smartest moves Netflix has ever done. They have managed to make one of the most complex characters on television with barely any dialogue. There is constant empathy felt for Eleven. You can tell from her expression that her childhood had been stripped from her life. She is separate from the world but we still manage to connect with her in an emotional way. Like ET, there innocence and circumstance leads us to worry and care about them as time goes on. The last part of the show is one of the most heart-breaking moments of television I've seen – but it all highlights one of the shows prominent themes – love. Also if Millie Brown isn't nominated for an Emmy alongside Winona, I'll lose my faith in the awards system. Age shouldn't be a hinder and if anything she has shown it shouldn't be correlated with skill – putting to shame many of Hollywood's actors.This show is weird, but in a unique way. It would be hard to compare a show like this to that of 'Game of Thrones' or 'Breaking Bad'. It is very much its own thing, taken the styles of some of the best 80s movies to create one golden piece of entertainment. Get ready to experience many different types of emotions within 6 hours.I do hope there is another season however, even if there isn't – this show is worthy to stand on just this one for repeated viewings. I hope this will be a classic for newer generations so they can experience the emotions and feelings found uniquely within the 80s. But I've taken up too much of your time already – just go and watch it.",9
North America,"...And now it happened.(I need 10 lines of text to be able to post this review but I have nothing to add.)It's magical, adventurous, never boring. The kids' acting (all of them) is out of this world. Just like the story, the atmosphere, everything.Stranger Things feels like one movie, and still it's too short. An endless story would be exactly right. Every episode my man and I were glued to the screen, almost sucked in.I love how nothing they came up with is too much. Could have been the case, like with so many fantasy/ sci-fi movies (if you ask me). It has just the right vibe.More of this please. Thank you.",10
North America,"What seemed like a mere 80s throwback from the looks of it, Stranger Things is much more like a homage to that period.Drilled down to its bare, this is a story about a mother's search for her lost child and the finesse with which its crafted among elements of mystery and sci-fi makes it highly intriguing. The cast does justice to their roles especially the protagonists who have given a truly believable performance. The background score is chosen to perfection and amplifies the retro feel of the show. Stranger things wont be breaking your scare meter but it will take control over you and keep you engaged till the very end.",10
North America,"The Duffer Brothers have nailed everything from the location and soundtrack to the cast with David Harbour fronting the way.Together combined to make a excellent 80s nostalgia experience without ever trying to force it. My best way to describe it would be you could throw it in the mix of some of the best back then and you wouldn't even noticed it was produced nearly 40 years later.The story has you hooked straight away and hits all the right buttons to create just a right amount of suspense, joy and maybe a few tears.I for one have been crying out for a series like this to come about so I am really looking forward to see where it goes next.",10
North America,"Season 1 of Stranger Things is about a boy that went missing, a secret government agency, and a monster. It is obvious the writers of the show are fans of 80s era horror. There were enough allusions and homages that even the densest person would pick up on one. That it felt like a Stephen King story, adapted by Dean Koontz, and directed by Steven Spielberg is hardly a bad thing.At only eight episodes, this does not seem like a show that is padded. Unfortunately, that is not the case. The story with Joyce (Winona Ryder) became redundant once she and Hopper (David Harbour) joined forces. The only consistency this series has is with the children. Their story is the driving force behind the series, and anything else just felt off.All in all, this is a decent show, and well worth wasting an afternoon or two watching.",7
North America,"For someone who doesn't love the 80s nostalgia (probably as I was not alive for them!) I was pleasantly surprised to find myself quickly immersed by the set dress and of course the amazing soundtrack. The casting and acting is fantastic especially eleven and the kids (I was even able to overcome my Winona Ryder aversion). However, I wasn't hooked until the 3-4th episode and that was short lived. I soon became bored of the cheesy cliché storyline, especially anything involving the teenagers, and the nods toward classic scifi and horror took over; leaving the plot unoriginal. Though in all I enjoyed the classic story, I feel it was tired and nothing special or worth the hype surrounding it. There was no major character arcs and the audience was too many steps ahead of the cast...leaving me frustrated. In my opinion the best thing about the show is the opening credits.",6
North America,"Wow.I wasn't convinced when I started this series - it seemed good, but I typically abandon TV shows half-watched, and my hopes were low. This one, though, I finished in a day.The characters are always a selling point for me, and these guys stole my heart. Couple that with the bust of nostalgia (from the 80s tunes right down to Winona Ryder), a solid plot and plenty of action... well, you've got yourself a winner. I've heard it compared to movies like The Goonies or Stand By Me - which definitely works.I was hooked after the first two episodes - I'd recommend giving this one a watch.",10
North America,"I watched this after a few recommendations, and I can tell you I won't be passing on the recommendation.The characters lack depth, but I guess its hard to show that over a short series.The story line draws inspiration from many old movies, nothing fresh and exciting.The music is good, but a lot of times it felt like the wrong choice of tone, I often wondered why some scenes had music at all.I feel like giving this a 1, to try and off set the 9.3 rating a bit.. I've rarely ever left a review before, in fact this could be my first one, but after seeing the rating I felt compelled to. This is definitely not the best show of all time.",3
North America,"Our collective/condensed memories of the 80's. The Goonies, ET, Stand By me, and The Thing ""COULD"" have been ""Stranger Things""......IF Doc Brown had swapped a VHS copy of JJ Abraham's SUPER 8 into Marty's coat pocket instead of that Almanac!! ..and, as a result? ALL of our cherished 80's movies memories actually WERE like Stranger Things!Never - in the history of cinema/TV/subscription-bit-rate-bandwidth - have I seen ""child actors"" so perfectly found, rounded-up together, cast, and directed so fluidly, with that ""innocent essence"" we all still love and remember about the films of the 1980's!..Bravo!",10
North America,"(Non spoilers) So I haven't really had much experience with the horror & sci-fi genre mix but this season was absolutely stunning. The flashbacks were smooth and perfectly timed packing even more feels to each scene. The quirky geek squad were sometimes predictable with their actions but they brought comedy and a separate theme of friendship to this TV series that made it just that more amazing. When I saw the 9.2 rating on IMDb (I think its going down slowly though) I was skeptical about a horror & sci-fi combo TV series getting this high of a score but after watching the entire season I happily will give this TV series a 9/10.(Spoilers) The only reason why it doesn't get a 10/10 is because although it starts with a violent shocking moment early on (where the shopkeeper gets shot), I never had that true feeling of unpredictability where you don't know who is going to die and at what moment. Another thing that they could of done is build up a back story more for Barbra and maybe used the other rude jocks (not Steve) a bit more.However all in all this an AMAZING T-V series and I strongly hope that they make a second season and that if they do that it will be as incredibly structured and just... ...damn good as this one was.",9
North America,"Its becoming a habit of the Netflix machine to churn out outstanding viewing! seemingly like all new shows the 1st series episode count is low only 8 episodes and leaves you wanting more, I hope more is what we get in the form of series 2! brilliant cast/acting/story line completely out of the norm! love the 80's settings and nostalgia!The Cast a mixture of unknown/faces you recognise but have no idea of their name and Winona Ryder (the only cast member I can genuinely remember the name of when I started watching)Ryders performance in this is outstanding worthy of awards same to be said of the Millie Bobby Brown the young girl who plays Ele(Eleven)",10
North America,"There are few movies or television series that I would call flawless. Even vaunted shows like Breaking Bad have their dud episodes, casting misfires, or occasional plot holes.I'm not going to rewrite the other reviews, talking about the great story, the fun (but not in your face) homages to classic horror and suspense movies, or how it gets the 80's just right.What I want to talk about is the AMAZING performances turned in by every single actor and actress. Obviously well-written, and well-directed, but absolutely well-performed as well. Any one of the performances by the 4 middle-school-aged kids that lead the action would be among the best child performances I have ever seen. All 4 together, in the same series, is mind-blowing. The adult leads are all Emmy caliber. Winona Ryder is unbelievable. David Harbour gives such a subdued performance as a broken Police Chief, without descending into the melodramatic and clichéd. I know Modine's been working right along, but this is the first thing I've seen him in in years.. and I think it's his best work. Even the minor roles.. the teacher, the police officers, the parents, are right on point, creating a television universe where complete suspension of disbelief is nearly automatic.I watched this show thinking that the hidden hand of Stephen King must somehow be involved.. more than just an inspiration. Writing from a kid's perspective (and getting it right), a la ""The Body"", or ""It"", is a rare skill indeed.Don't miss ""Stranger Things"".",10
North America,"For several years I've researched various TV shows and movies to see if they're worth watching and for the most part I agree with the IMDb rating. Anything over a 9 is usually binge-worthy. Shows like The Sopranos, Breaking Bad, Dexter, Six Feet Under, etc live up to their ratings here but Stranger Things in the same category? I found it entertaining but the production, cinematography and sound track are just okay.I agree with those who have pointed out the similarities with ET, Poltergeist, Carrie. I watched the whole first season of Stranger Things and while it's better than most everything regular TV networks release these days I gotta say the rating is ""just a bit outside.""",5
North America,"I expected more from this show. Stranger Things didn't surprised me. The first 4 episodes are slow and boring and the final episode is not epic.The best was the ambiance, a very good art direction (even 3D is designedly badly done).This TV series have a good sci-fi and adventure history but a bad horror and mystery. Acting is good, but writing is not. Good and bad points.It's not horrible but it's not a big show, it's just a 80's blockbuster so I think the nostalgia feeling is sedating people.6/10",6
North America,"Netflix has done again after shows like Daredevil and House of Cards. Its almost like one new great show every year. First episode would grasp your interest to watch more. Acting by Eleven, Hopper and Joyce is really good. I don't hear about Duffer Brothers before, I guess this is their first big project and they nailed it. This show has been much better but I feel something not plausible. Like research done by 3 friends in search of Will. They are searching whole city, risking their lives and more. If the monster took Will, why wouldn't he will take you? In my opinion, someone adult or police should have done that kind of research in finding Will. Police Chief Hopper had done so much already but giving that role to children is over hypothetical. In real life that will never happen. Secondly, why the monster will keep Will alive. He captured Will in first 8 minutes, why didn't he just eat him? Why would he kill Barbara and other? And Finally, their science teacher he has answer to everything. Shoot any question and he has the answer ready. He didn't need to look into any book or anything. Except these 3 things, I really enjoyed the show. I guess Eleven and Monster are still alive and we'll see in Season 2. Its best Netflix show, certainly better than House of Cards or Daredevil. I don't say whether this is best new show of 2016 or not, because I hope HBO's 'Westworld' will be better. Hopefully they will maintain this kind of quality in Season 2.",8
North America,"This mini-series has a lot of buzz before it's release. While I was seeing Marco Polo (pretty good series) saw the trailer and remember saying ""Looks like a good suspense-science-fiction mini series, I need to see this one"".Then I started. I fell into the trap.The issue here is that this is made for 10-15 years boys. It's a more than amazing show for that range. But there is no a direct message in the trailer implying this.In one of the first episodes, there is a scene of a dead person in the cafeteria with a bullet in his head, lying there, really explicit...if you know what I mean. This is really misleading. For a moment, I thought I was seeing a serious show with ""magic"" touches thanks to the kids and their story. How wrong I was.The number of scenes when any character made a stupid decision or movement, is countless. For example, the van flying in the air, falling in front of the 3 other government's vans in the pursuit: in serious story, they would have just passed through the vehicle's side and continue pursuing the kids that were ON BICYCLES!But not in this show. 10-15 years boys won't question that logic. So they don't have to take care of those details. All of those grownup who made it trhough the 7° episode, will anyhow finish the series anyway, so screw them.This is seriously, a trap for people over 18 years old.Be aware.",6
North America,"Throughout the years I found it difficult to get rid of so many images in my head that came directly from some of Stephen King's novels. When I sat to watch the whole eight hours of Stranger Things I was in one of those trips of my life of which I didn't want out.This is a film, much more than a series. You could skip the intro titles and have a seamless story told with depth, comedy, heart and wit.From what I said above, you can tell I regard Stephen King pretty high on my list of American writers. He teamed once with the other Steve to make a series that promised something new (because the book was good) and utterly failed. So, I'd rather take King's writings than adaptations. But Spielberg's films are films, not books, and lots of them are absolutely fantastic. Borrowing from two great story-tellers and making something worth has never been easy. I'd say impossible. Because I haven't found anything even close to E.T. or ""The Body"" (which became Stand by Me), ever.And what makes this new Netflix venture worth a ton of gold is that it actually gets to places you and I want to go. The characters are beautifully drawn, and then layered and painted in a way they'll stick with you for a long time.This film, even with the slight criticism of not being perfect in some regards (like some of the songs), is a masterpiece of storytelling for kids, teens and adults. It is as enjoyable as E.T. was. So much that I want to see it on the big screen. It's not a trivial series. It's as serious as it gets.The kids in the film are memorable, really creating a brotherhood that I wanted to be a part of. All of them have their own problems, their very clearly defined personalities and roles, their charming funny sides... they're lovable and you can relate to any of them.Winona Rider's character is full of passion and realism in this otherwise completely fictitious tale. But, wasn't that what ""It"" gave us? Even with the terrible ending of the book and the miniseries, who in the world wouldn't remember Bev shooting her silver bullets in the sewer against ""It""? Or the conversation between Gordie and Chris under the tree when camping by the Royal River? Lines from the heart of gold of Stephen King. Action and adventure from the mind of Steven Spielberg. But this is different. Matt and Ross Duffer created something that may have all the elements of those 80's films and novels, but with freshness and depth.You can relate to the characters because they ARE human, they are well developed, you KNOW about them. That's King's turf. And the emotions, the adventures, the way they're captured are Spielberg's signature. But, alas! here we have both worlds in one film that will be as timeless as It was or E.T. Characters like Eleven may be part of future conversations of younger generations, as are Gordie and Chris, who will never stop moving young and adult audiences even 40 years later.The whole success of this series is that, at last, the Duffers brought to the screen something with real soul. And that's pretty uncommon nowadays.",10
North America,"I only manage to finish this series by ""purge watching."" It's my own term. It's the opposite of ""binge watching"" where you're apparently so enraptured by a show you can't stop watching. ""Purge watching"" is when you can't wait for a series to be over, so you use the fast forward button during the throw-away, series-padding scenes. And there's a lot of padding in the show. Like a cheap Stephen King Santa. Honestly, are we supposed to really accept this asa ""homage"" or is it just the ultimate recycling job? A number of critics thought 8 hours devoted to the somewhat thin story of ""Stranger Things"" was excessive. I was thinking about the story in my head, and if it hadn't been given the soap opera drag out treatment, condensed down to a 2-hour movie it would have been even worse -- exposing more clearly the basic silliness and retread plot. The watered-down tempo helped what otherwise would have been Cream of Condensed Tripe. You could claim running the same old numbers is in the name of ""homage"" or you could argue there's really not a lot of new ideas in the show. From the first scene where the scientists get pulled upward into the elevator, dangled by an unseen beast, I went ""ho hum."" Like I haven't see that visual in a million monster films. An old clever show like the X-Files would have had a pair of eyes creepily material in the wall of an elevator and then maybe the doors close and a scream. That show as extremely creative at coming up with original ideas and images -- which is why it was a great show. But immediately I wasn't that impressed with the ""Duffer Brothers"" mise en scene. I need more ""things I've never seen before"" from Sci-fi. And little touches like the elevator scene are where true originals and moderate talents separate themselves. I nearly bailed completely on the series. Episode 3&4 were sluggishly directed by Shawn Levy, who is pretty much an incompetent as a stylist. By episode 4, it has completely lost the ""vintage feel"" and leaning on the influences of contemporary cable: Let's play a moving piece of rock music over amontage of the different actors staring thoughtfully into space. The music swells... It's the HBO Method of audience intercourse. A directorial cliché. Sorry, but this doesn't have the ""feel"" of a 70s or 80s production at all, maybe a bit in the opening episode or two, but it pretty much is quickly replaced by a run-of-the-mill cable show feel. Vintage Spielberg always had a very kinetic feel. 70s and early 80s films were riffing off the vibe of Altman, Pennebaker, Penn, but sanitizing them a bit and joking them up. The vibe of this series is probably closest in spirit to the lousy cheapie Steven King films, and not in a good way. It's a leaden feel. I'm still skeptical of the ""tribue"" aspect of this show The Winonna""Poltergiest"" ripoff/tribute is the worst bit so far. Where's the dwarf psychic? As I also noted they managed to pay ""homage"" to ""Under the Skin"" and ""Pan's Labyrinth"" Were those nostalgic ""homages?"" If your pose a show as a tribute (and make sure to let people know up front to cover your tracks) does that eradication the icky ""borrowing."" I think a couple of producers (the Duffers you would assume) sat down and said: ""Yeah, I like the kid with powers from FireStarter, let's use that. And the kids from ""It"". The whole kid thing from King. ""Alien"" was a great movie. How about goo? And we'll stay away from the afterlife and just make it a portal to another dimension...."" Add Shaw Levy's teleplay staging (someone should let him know the camera moves) and it's all a bit snoozy. By the way, I also notice that the Duffer Brothers didn't write the series. They farmed out the episodes to a bunch of writer. Right there, their auteur status goes down the drain, IMO. Interestingly, I noticed that the Duffer Brothers wrote the teleplay for Episode 8, but another writer suddenly turns up with a ""story by"" credit (for the first time in the series) for that episode. That tell's me the Duffers' couldn't even figure out how to put a cap on their own series and brought in someone else to make sense of it. And the ending is all pretty perfunctory and predictable. They even managed to reproduce Steven King's most reliable device ... not being able to produce a really satisfying ending. So anyway, that's that. I'd give it a""C."" And warn Steven King to keep his paper covered during the next test.",4
North America,"I'm mad I waited so long to watch this. It was sitting in my queue for the longest and I had no idea what I was denying myself. What a great cast, such a compelling and intriguingly woven tale. The music was so invoking yet non-invasive. That title graphic alone is brilliant. As an 80s baby the sounds and the visuals brought on some serious nostalgia. Goodness, I'm sure there's something wrong with this show, but there's so much good about it, I either didn't notice or it doesn't matter.Well, I guess the negative could be that it's ONLY 8 episodes long! Oy! Now I have to figure out what to do with myself. Here comes the binge crash.Good stuff! Good good stuff!",9
North America,"Netflix did it again with Stranger Things. It's a very pleasant and easy to follow series to watch. It's like a time warp back to the eighties. A mixture of The Goonies meets The X-Files meets Close Encounters Of A Third Kind. I watched the whole first season in just a couple days. You immediately get hooked on this show. I don't know if the makers will add another season to it and if they do I'm already very curious what it will be about. Will it be a complete other story or will it just continue where the first season ended? It doesn't matter to me, I just want more seasons like this one. The cast is very good. All the actors fit perfectly well in the story. There is enough suspense to keep you interesting all the time. Watch this one, you won't regret it.",9
North America,"It's time for #realtalk. STRANGER THINGS is OVERRATED. Apparently everyone looking down the barrel of turning 40 years old decided they needed nostalgic rejuvenation and rode this TV-PG ""boner for the 80's"" all week.Even at 8 eps it runs too long. The story could have easily been told as a movie. And it's so intentionally filled with cliché -- if I have to see a black hole explained with a folded piece of paper & a pencil thru it ONE MORE TIME! -- that it tastes stale and feels exaggeratedly sentimental.That said, there is some fun in watching the show, just know it's family friendly TV and not a dark or dramatic story aimed at adults. But the fun isn't enough to carry it for 8 hours.",6
North America,"I went in to watch this series without any understanding of what it's about, and the style of it. Even though I had heard a lot of boasting about this, I figured I'd just try it. When it first started I got chills. It felt kind of nostalgic but new. The style reminds me of Twin Peaks.I was hooked before episode 1 was done, and I ended up binge-watching the whole season. The characters are fantastic, and the acting is really impressive. The story was perfect and left me in a state in which I can't wait until the next season.The Duffer brothers have made this my all time favorite series.",10
North America,"Netflix has commissioned some great shows of late, Making a Murderer, Better Call Saul, Narcos, Bloodline and now Stranger Things.When you see the trailer you think, OK a homage to the 80's but so what... Well I've not seen a series of it's genre that not only shocks, scares and thrills but actually builds likable yet flawed characters through great writing, directing and acting (and very well edited of course).The main stars of the show are the children who are natural, funny and utterly believable. Think Pans Labyrinth meets a Spielberg film but darker and better! Give it a go.",9
North America,"This is a decent show that in my opinion unfortunately doesn't come nowhere near a 9 or a 10 that most people have given it .I'll try to keep it as short as possible and go with the pros first:1)The acting is very good and the kids did a nice job especially the girl playing Eleven and the boy playing Dustin.2)The general idea of the show is interesting (but ruined by some very stupid stuff,more on that in the cons)3)I liked the cinematography and the overall tone/atmosphere of the show4)The music/soundtrack is coolNow to the cons:1)The monster in the show is basically a walking rotting flower with teeth that comes from an evil dimension and it seems to be the sole inhabitant of that place.I could somehow get past the fact that it's alone but the way it looks really ruined the show for me.I can't believe that anybody in their right mind can give a green light for that look.2)The pace of the show is extremely slow and I feel like it could have easily been 4 episodes instead of 8.3)The stupidity of most of the characters is at an insane level:a)Jonathan and Nancy.This is basically their thinking: 'You know that creature that comes through walls and that took away 2 kids already? How about we take a gun and a baseball bat and go alone into the woods at night and kill it.' They basically attempted this 2 times(the 2nd time they even kind of know what they're dealing with which makes that attempt even more ridiculous).I'm sorry but I just couldn't believe that somebody would be that dumb and that also ruined the show for me.b)The sheriff broke into that facility once and got caught(and they just let him go but they immediately kill the burger dude in the diner for no reason whatsoever??),so he figured why not give it a second shot,f**k the cameras and the probably increased security,this time it's gotta work right? Stupid ,lazy screen writing that doesn't make any sense.c)Hey teacher excuse me for calling so late but how exactly do you make a sensory deprivation chamber?Say what?Why do I ask?It's just for an experiment .Oh it's for an experiment you say? Well if that's the case let me just explain this real quick to a 10 year old.You boys be safe,good night ;)I could go on and on but I'll just wrap it up by saying that this show was a bit of a disappointment for me.It had great potential and an interesting premise that was ruined by lazy writing and the worst looking monster I have ever laid eyes on.I'd compare this to Wayward Pines,a couple of interesting mysterious episodes but then it just went downhill.I'm giving it a 6.5-7 /10.",7
North America,"I read an interview with the kids in this show in which they called it a period piece. Calling Stranger Things a period piece is an oversimplification. No, this show is an honest to goodness time machine. It may as well have been made in the 80's. Sure, there are some modern special effects, but they are modest, and not really distracting from the feeling that you really are back in the 80's while watching this show.The music. OH the music. That deep synthesizer reminiscent of so many classic Sci-Fi and Horror movies of the time. From the PERFECTLY done opening titles, to the sparse but immensely timed score, it sets the tone, and prepares you for something great.That said, the acting is what makes this show something truly special. It took me at least 10 minutes of screen time to realize I was watching Wynona Ryder. To a one, the cast is phenomenal. Finn Wolfhard (the most awesome name ever) as Michael is the second coming of Henry Thomas' Elliot in E.T. The kid is awesome, but there's no way, at that age, that he could be such a perfect analogue for Elliot. That's great casting, an adult who saw a you be actor who was just like Henry Thomas at that age. Toothless is SO the ""Wolfman gots nards"" kid from Monster Squad, and he kills it. El...Millie Brown Bobby is the next great thing. She communicates so much with just her facial expressions, you just want to love her before she even says a word.Stranger Things is also mature, thoughtful, and sometimes terrifying. It spends ample time on its characters, and it makes their lives relate-able in that way we never want to relate.Kudos to Netflix, once again, for taking a shot at an underdog and coming out a Champ.",10
North America,"Just finished this. This has been one of the most amazing things I have ever had the pleasure of watching. The cast,the score,the direction....everything is literally perfect! I found myself creeped out/intrigued/heartfelt/amused.....just absolutely absorbed and invested in every single word spoken and scene shot. Aside all of this,its set authentically in the 80s where kids on bikes are the heroes (Think E.T/Goonies etc). The character dynamics across the board were faultless and having Mobys 'When its cold Id like to die' in the final moments (A hugely sentimental piece of music to me anyway) was just genius and don't think any other moment of anything else could warrant using it. Bravo to the Duffer brothers for an absolute masterpiece from start to finish. I don't impress easy but this is a straight up 10/10 without hesitation",10
North America,"Story >> The story is good but not unique, you can pretty much see it in some of the horror films. That's right, the show didn't appear as a series to me but as a good horror/mystery movie rather. There's no twists and turns. It didn't give quite the scare or mysterious vibe.Characters >> The characters are generic. The actors/actresses' portrayal is fine but sometimes, becomes annoying. There's nothing depth about the characters, even the supposed to be mysterious ones aren't intriguing but perhaps, they'll grow in season 2. Usually, there are characters that you'll like the moment you see them, but that isn't the case in here. I can't root for them, I just see them as plain characters of a show. I don't feel any connection towards any of them that I won't really care if someone dies.Graphics >> It's pretty good. I do appreciate most of the movie/show graphics, actually. Since I'm always left in wonder of how they can pull it off.Sound >> It's lacking in this point. This is one of the reasons why it didn't give quite a scare or mysterious vibe. The choice of music isn't impressive either.Overall >> It's good and worth a watch, but I don't think it deserved a 9+ rating. In the end, it isn't bad, but it isn't that good either.",7
North America,"Honestly, I've never been a fan of science fiction, so I didn't think I was going to like it as much as everyone else does. But I'm pleasantly surprised. I mean, it's not the greatest show I've ever seen, but I watched the first season over two days and I can't wait for more. One of the best things about Stranger Things is the acting. I'm always impressed when kids can act because I know when I was a kid I would've been so over the top and dramatic, but for the most part these kids are total naturals, specifically Millie Brown and Gaten Matarazzo. They were better than some of the adults. The kids reminded me of a blend of The Goonies, Stand By Me, and Freaks & Geeks, which I really loved because it was great to see characters like that again and it just felt right for the story. My one complaint however was the swearing, especially in front of parents. I'm not sure why the media always has young kids swearing but that is so unrealistic to me. I never knew any kids that swore when I was that age. I'm not offended by swearing, it's just that it was a bit distracting because it felt like they were trying too hard. The relationship between the actors felt so real; you really believed they had grown up together and were the best of friends. There were only a couple actors that I felt shouldn't have been cast, but for the most part the cast was perfect. I couldn't believe how few roles so many of them have had, and yet they were so believable. From the very first episode you are completely hooked. The intro is so short and simple yet it's perfect. The music and graphics go so well together. It's not an opening credits that you feel like skipping. There was one scene when my jaw dropped and I knew instantly there was going to be so much to uncover. I loved the story lines and the nostalgic feeling I had when watching Stranger Things. A time before Internet and cell phones, when kids used their imagination and went on adventures. I grew up in the nineties and it's rare to find a show these days that doesn't rely heavily on being current. I was glad that there was hardly any sex in this show (I'm sounding like a complete prude, I know) because I think that will give it a chance for teens to watch it with their parents without it being awkward or too mature for younger viewers. This is the type of show we need right now. Just a good, suspenseful, mysterious drama to indulge in. It's the perfect blend of scifi and drama and I can't wait to find out what happens next season.",8
North America,"I want to write a review on how amazingly this show is executed. It felt like I am watching a classic 80's film. Every single detail was hit to perfection. There are some flaws with the show and there aren't but a couple of characters of which you'd care. It's cliché and predictable but none of that matters. The opening credits are so pulled from the influences that I actually felt like I was back 30 years ago watching something fresh. It's boring and you really don't give a crud about any of the characters, but you still watch it. To me, that's an amazing accomplishment. David Hauser and Winona Ryder KILL IT!! The other characters you either hate or just tolerate. Regardless, for something I actually disliked watching, for the sheer genius of execution, I give a solid 10!!",10
North America,"It reminded me of my childhood!I was excepting it for a long time since i heard of it!! It was more than I expected! All my best movies in one, combining mystery, fantasy ,weird humour and great music!!! Perfect scenery, great cast, i am so happy to see Winona Ryder!! The atmosphere gets you so much in the eighties mood that we love so much!! I hope more series like that will come!!I already put it first on my list with my favorites !! I definitely would suggested to everyone seeing it! It leaves you with some questions that makes you wonder.. May be a season two will come..",10
North America,"I have watched hundreds and thousands of movies and TV series and rated them all but its my second review for anything on IMDb. I had feeling that i have to write about it. After Mr. Robot, this TV show ""Stranger Things"" just passed out all the standards of being perfect. Its so addicted that you cant leave without watching whole show in one sit. While watching I was remembering the old classics ""Stand by Me"" & ""The Breakfast Club"" and enjoying the better added fantasy and perfection to it. Seriously i don't know who are the creators of Netflix but those people are really great and should make some historical hits like this. I will save this in my archive of best shows ever.",10
North America,"Contains spoilers...I'll get straight to the point, I will not watch season 2. I really really wanted to like this show but NOTHING happens in it. Seems like the writers are building the story up to for what may (or may not) be more interesting in the future but I will not waste any more time on it. Here is a quick review of what happened on season 1: - Kid gets kidnapped by scary creature - Sheriff looks for the kid and believe at some point that a secret organization is hiding him - Some girl has super powers and can contact the creature world (which is a parallel dimension), locate people there, etc'... - Secret organization chasing after girl with super powers, girl smack their asses every time. - Sheriff and missing kid's mom going to other dimension to rescue kid (they succeed) - girl kills creature and disappears with itThis main story could have been made to a lousy one and half/two hour film, instead it stretches on almost eight hours with in-between cliché teenager stories and uninteresting sub plots. 80's ambiance is great with sound track, acting and overall feeling. Plot-wise, The other dimension had no story depth which makes the main story feel shallow, just some brainless killer creature/s from a parallel dimension, a kid getting kidnapped (and get saved eventually) and a girl with telekinetic powers which we learn almost nothing about and why she has those powers.",6
North America,"Everything about this series is excellent.Cast, screen writing, the period piece, soundtrack, acting; its all amazing.David Harbour is beyond amazing. He should get nominated for a Golden Globe for his role as the Chief.Winona Ryder is excellent. Loved they are acting again together. Previous was in The Iceman (2012) which if you haven't seen is excellent.This series by the Duffer Brothers developed the characters beyond anything I can recall seeing recently. Every character is likable or not and its because you know something about them. Right down to the boys science teacher.Matthew Modine is extremely good as the federal agent. I can't recall a role he's done that I didn't like.Please have an open mind with this series and watch it. Rewatch any unfinished episodes. Netflix Original nailed it yet again.Excellent.",5
North America,"Sure, the 80s look and feel is great, including the title sequence and the music, but that's not all.Every main character evolves and becomes better versions of themselves. The use of Dungeons & Dragons as a metaphor to help us and the main characters to understand what is happening.This show was very well thought out and executed.I don't like giving 10/10 because (usually) nothing is perfect, there's always things that could have been done better, but the creators of Stranger Things nailed everything. Well done!Let's hope season 2 is just as good! :)",10
North America,"This has been described as a ""love letter to '80's cinema"", with its cheesy gooey monsters and boundary-crossing research on humans that drive the plot. I don't watch this genre, but fell in love with Stranger Things. There's the main plot of trying to find a lost boy, and then the plots and relationships that develop around it - a group of kids that form their own search party to look for their friend, and their relationship with another kid who is running from mysterious bad guys and whom they enlist to help them. I love this show for the epic monster-battles and the loyalty that the kids have for each other. It's one of those things where they have their own little world, separate from the adults, and is the cutest thing to watch.*Possible spoiler* The solitary reason I gave it 9 stars instead of 10 is that the friendships take a predictable turn in one way. Nevertheless, I give it major points for not being afraid to make their bond more complicated than being perfect all the time, which makes it realistic and all the sweeter for it. Absolutely fantastic.",9
North America,"This show is really addictive. Once I started watching, I just couldn't stop! The cast is just amazing. The way the kids bond, their crazy comments (especially Dustin's) are so hilarious! Everything lovable in good movies seem to be in the show. It makes you feel like you're part of the story, like you're pulled in to that small strange town, observing from its other dimension.If you're a big fan of Spielberg's and King's stories and their wonderful way of telling stories, you're in for a treat. There are only eight episodes. So, it's easy to just gulp down the entire season one in one night -- which I did. I can't wait for season two to see how the unresolved problem will develop and how the characters will cope with it this time.",9
North America,"I don't usually get too excited about new T.V. shows I've recently discovered, apart from maybe 'Vikings,' but on this occasion it must be mentioned.If you haven't already I implore you to watch this show.The Acting is superb, the casting spot on, the soundtrack inspired, the pacing and mood totally mesmerizing. I have tried very hard to find faults or weak links in each episode and I honestly can't.It's all those great movies and T.V. shows we grew up watching as kids all rolled in to one, and yet in so many ways better than any of them. They all played a part in our childhood, they still give us that wonderful feeling of nostalgia and that is exactly what 'Stranger Things' does. It reminds us of how film used to make us feel when we where kids, and how could that possibly be a bad thing?Millie Bobby Brown deserves an Oscar, she has more talent in her little finger than half the cast of 'Game of Thrones.' Every one word / line delivery leaves you entirely invested in her performance, every emotion is displayed so intensely and openly in her eyes that she puts most adult actors to shame.This show deserves your attention, it may have taken a lot from the old 80's classics but isn't that what great art is? Paying homage to what came before but also respectfully making it better?",7
North America,"This is a show, where I can't really understand negative reviews. - Some write the acting was terrible/awful.. -> What? As an actor I can almost certainly guarantee you, that the acting was solid, if not outstanding (eleven) and if you didn't like it, it is probably because the person or their character is not appealing for you to watch. Also keep in mind, there were many takes and the ones that made it into the final product, are the ones the directors wanted, so blame them and not the actors. - Some write the plot was boring/simple/predictable and the story didn't really come to an end and didn't answer all questions. -> What? This is a Mystery show, if you answer all questions, whats mysterious about it? o0 Most of you don't seem to understand this business at all. You have to kind of bring the show to an end and leave some backdoors for possible more seasons if the show is a success. How do you think this is possible if not by how the creators of this show did it? Oh an the plot was boring/predictable, etc.? Well congratulations you probably have watched and/or read lots of scifi/mystery/thriller movies and books, because for me it was really entertaining and not predictable at all. And even if you figured what could happen next, it was still interesting to watch how the characters would react etc.To anyone giving this less than 6/10 this is just unfair. The acting is solid if not very good, the soundtrack is amazing, cinematography is outstanding, coloring is great, effects are very decent, how can you give this profession no credit? If you would give 1 point for every job that has been done well in this show, you cannot get less than 6/10 unless you rate only by your personal taste and that is a highly subjective rating and thus not really helpful/significant to other people.",10
North America,"Noir 80's feel for the whole series combined with some amazing storytelling and script. Great acting, directing and some pretty cool set pieces.The atmosphere was there, and it seems that all the actors actually enjoyed taking part which made the whole series flow much better.The best way to describe it without ruining anything for those that haven't seen it is.. Well, throw in a bit of old school 80's horror, add a dash of Alien with a sprinkling of Nightmare on Elm Street. Stir in bit of poltergeist and lightly finish off with a touch of The Goonies.It's one of those gems of a series that you will enjoy.. Heck, even my mother who's in her late 60s loved it.My only complaint? It could have easily been fleshed out to more episodes and more time spent on the missing boy (those who have seen it will know what I mean) and for that reason only, it loses a point. Otherwise a sure fire 10/10.Even so, Everyone who took part should be proud and take a deserved bow.Here's hoping for season 2...",9
North America,"This movie has something for anyone who grew up loving 80's Sci-Fi only with better production values. Everything is vintage and authentic: the setting, the villains, the protagonists, the atmosphere, the stereotypes, the bullies...even the credits reminded me of my youth. As you would imagine with so many 10 star ratings, the story is compelling and the acting is brilliant. I started watching this based on a recommendation from my daughter and before I knew it, it was 2:30 in the morning. I haven't immersed myself in a show like this in a very long time and I loved every minute of it. Bravo to Netflix for another wonderful, if not their best, original series.",10
North America,"Stranger Things a most enjoyable 80s throw back. This series comprises a lot of elements that I personally love in movie making. The story was amazingly written and the cast was terrific. The two things that most count in making a hit.The story gels together nicely from episode to episode. The hook is well done at the end of every episode bringing you back for the next episode. The cast was awesome with every actor portrayal be great even the bit actors.I love the way elements from Steven Spielberg movies and elements form Stephen King books were brought together with the makers paying homage to both. The 1980s setting is so good and well done. I personally love 80s movies and having that feeling was fantastic, pure nostalgia.I miss movie making like this where storytelling and talented actor drive the film. Now it's rehash, reboot and special effects galore with no substance at all. Originality is out the window with just poor and lazy movie making.It feels like one long movie with a running time of just over 7 hrs with episodes being roughly 52 minutes long with others a little shorter. My only problem would be the slow pace in some episodes, the ones which are over 52 minutes. It could have been edited a little better by shortening the episodes to about 48 minutes.With every actor's performance being good from child actors to adult actors, good story telling and a 80s styling, Stranger Things is a great example of how movie making should be done. A strong nine out of ten, near flawless and I highly recommend it. I'm sure you won't be disappointed.",9
North America,"I can't believe what garbage this show was. Watching nothing but screaming and panic for hours upon end, no character background to be found, horrible humming noises, and every cliché ever made dumped into a sloppy mess. The monster, the government, and the kid 11 have almost no meaning, no explanation, and no relationship to each other. The only reason this gets anything over a rating of 1 is because the costumes and background really reminded me of the old days (haha). I don't know why they left the ending open like they did. If they're planning on a second season they should consider starting over and using a different cast.",4
North America,"Stranger things is best watched at once, binge watching all 8 episodes, as this really makes you appreciate how intricate and detailed the storytelling is, being presented as a long movie more than a series. The characters are extremely releateable, and diverse, with multiple characters and subplots which all connect back to each other in brilliant ways, leaving enough mystery for the inevitable season 2.The 80s nostalgia is hugely present, the series being clearly influenced by the likes of Spielberg, Stephen King among others, and the series is all the better for it.The soundtrack is also great, creating an eerie presence, whilst also featuring classic tracks from the period.Overall, I highly recommend checking it out.",10
North America,"The story takes place in 1983 Hawkins, Indiana. When a middle school boy named Will mysteriously vanishes his three best friends, mother, brother and a local police chief become engrossed in supernatural events in an attempt to find him. The plot for this movie feels like something out of a Stephen King novel. It seems like the show is self-aware its own influences too. There are references made to eighties sci-fi horror films all throughout the series (Evil Dead, The Thing). So this isn't the most original show ever made, and I admit if I was just going off of the plot description, I probably wouldn't have invested my time in it. But this series offers something pretty interesting. It isn't something completely new, but it takes previous works and blends them together to create a story and style of its own. Imagine the Goonies and Twin Peaks colliding with a John Hughes film and a Stephen King novel and getting dropped in the middle of The Twilight Zone's universe. That best describes Stranger Things. Its creativity comes from its ability to mix influences and that's why it clings on to you with in the first episode. It provides something that is familiar but ultimately gives us something new.Eighties nostalgia is alive and well and you can clearly see its influences in the today's art-work, whether it be music, film or fashion. The only problem I've ever had with eighties-influenced art is when the artist makes something that is outdated and clearly would only work if been made in the eighties. However, Stranger Things is different. It wouldn't work as well if it was made in the eighties. The modern visual effects, directing, and cinematography compliment the series beautifully and make it easier to immerse yourself in this type of art. The modernization of this story gives it a component of clarity. While if this was made in the eighties, it would have gotten buried because it would just be stamped as another clichéd sci-fi thriller. But today, it stands out as a uniquely stylized and beautifully composed masterpiece. But it isn't just the style and visuals that keep you engaged. The story line twists enough to always keeps you guessing, but never enough to alienate or confuse you (like an M. Night Shyamalan film). The acting is phenomenal. Wynona Rider showcases her incredible acting chops to their full extent. She gives an absolutely heartbreaking performance. While the young actors in this film show us that their inexperience never gets the better of them. They never get overshadowed by their seasoned co-stars.One of the most admirable things about this series is that is stays well-grounded even with all the ridiculously abnormal activity. The charters never seem over-the-top or clichéd. Everyone in the series stays relatable. The story never gets confusing or incoherent. The blend of CGI with the natural backgrounds never gets sloppy or excessive. The score compliments the style beautifully. It never exaggerates a scene but keeps us submerged in the story by providing a signature eeriness to each scene.Stranger Things is truly another one of Netflix's crowning achievements. I look forward to the seasons to come.",9
North America,"This film is a love letter to fans of the genre. Absolutely a gem for all time. Once you start you cant STOP!!! Top Notch execution!I haven't seen a film that has kept my attention like this one has in a very long time. The story is so bold but yet flourishes with tenderness, it will literally make you feel every emotion imaginable like a harp being strummed from one end to the other. Don't miss out on a well executed film. It has surpassed so many of my expectations and has put many blockbuster films of the genre to shame. Take it from me it has made me and instant fanboy.Till Next Time!!",9
North America,"I have never seen a professional actor overact the way that Ryder does in this series. Beside the other actors, she looks like the amateur who does 'crazy' so badly that one thinks she has Parkinson's. The other actors reaction to her is of simple amazement that she has chosen the same trembling, entire body movement to express a simple sentence. No wonder she hasn't been in anything for years. People have finally had enough of her. Why they decided to drag her out of hiding to do this series is anyone's guess. The rest of the cast was OK. Some of the dialogue was pretty forced, but even the kids do a better job than Winona Ryder. She ruins the series.",7
North America,"Honestly, although this show definitely has a homage to old movies and books, it's more original than most shows you will see today. I love the feel of the show, it definitely has that vintage ""80's-90s"" feel to it. And i love that the only ""big"" star is Winona Ryder (sorry if spelt wrong) it makes it seem and feel real, despite the whole, evil monster, upside down world. The kids dress like kids and act like real kids which makes it all the more relatable and draws you in. It's so intense and thrilling. I'm not one to yell at the TV during a scary movie but this show had my attention. It reminds me of good old movies like ""stand by me"" or ""sandlot"" because its authentic to how kids act unlike shows hot in the media like ""fuller house"" where kids where bow ties and say ""holy chalupa"" instead they use actual language a kid of their age would or have actions that they would really make. It's not sugar coded and sex, drugs, alcohol, bullying and much much more are real. No one is perfect and that's what really hits home, that's what makes it original. And even when you see the monster it's not completely fake looking like in most horror films now. Most shows now are the same thing over and over again; perfect family, perfect house, drama drama drama, perfect hair, ugly mixed matched clothes that are supposed to be cool, perfect kids who do no wrong. It's annoying. Everyone is also, honestly, a pretty good actor/ actress. The acting isn't so robotic. And the mystery keeps you so invested. They give you enough in each episode to really keep you interested and intrigued. Very much hope there is more to come in another season.",10
North America,"If your not a Netflix subscriber you've probably never heard of this show, but from what I can see it's getting advertised quite well, so I could be wrong.""Stranger Things"" is an 80's style sci-fi/horror type of drama, as of today there are eight episodes so far. Winona Ryder is an excellent choice for a pivotal role in this saga. She is a tour de force, watching her on screen brings smiles to my face because she really hasn't been in anything remotely good for a really long time.The series really has a mixture of everything that was cool back in the early 80's it was like I was watching this through the eyes of a 10 year old boy with wonder and amazement. We are introduced to many characters, with roles similar to either ""The Goonies"" or ""Stand By Me"" There are also hints of the film ""Firestarter"" as well. I really don't want to give too much away. So I won't make this a spoiler review. Just a generalization.Every episode seems to have a theme, but sticks to the basic underlying plot and some great tunes from the 80's to go along with it. With the likes of the late David Bowie and so forth. There is also some elements of the X-Files from time to time, but it's not very pronounced and in your face, just a very subtle feeling from that show, even though it was based in the 90's, it still has that feel.It was nice seeing Matthew Modine in this show as well, I haven't seen him in so long I could hardly recognize him. Unknown to me Charlie Heaton plays a really strong role as well, he has a lot of talent. The three main child actors Finn Wolfhard, Caleb McLaughlin, Gaten Matarazzo bring to their roles such passion they make you feel like a kid again.""Stranger Things"" is a well rounded show, that has allowed forgotten actors from the past to breath new life into television again, with so many shows based on Zombies and Reality, it's nice to sink your teeth into something fun and mysterious such as this show. ""Stranger Things"" could go anywhere, and do anything the gates are wide open, and it's just amazing the talented writers in this world can still master the marvel of cinematography. I recommend this show to anyone above the age of ten. Some kids might find some scenes frightening, but all in all a definite winner.",9
North America,"This show is one of the best shows of 2016. The 1980s time period was captured quite well. The town, the clothes, the hair styles stayed very true to the period. At first I didn't know if Wynona Ryder was going to be good in this kind of role, she did fantastic. It's in the vein of movies like The Goonies or Monster Squad or Lean on me were the children play an important part of driving the story. By the end of the season as you finish the last episode you will be sad that you will have to wait to see the next chapter in the series. The Netflix all episodes available at once model makes this a buffet your upset when it closes.",9
North America,"There is a reason this is unoriginal and its because the Duffer brothers are paying homage to Stephen Kings IT since they were not allowed be a part of the big screen remake for next year. IT was one of my favourite childhood horror mini series although seems more like a long movie in reality. I knew it seemed so familiar before reading an article about the remake of the Stephen King Classic. From the outset the geeky kids who are best friends, the school bullies, the bicycles; I was almost thinking one of them would should out "" Hi ho silver away!"" when riding at speed. Of course this is a line from The Lone Ranger but its not what I associate the expression with. The lair where Winona Ryders son is discovered and how he is disconnected is almost exactly the same as the lair in IT. The alien or creature is very similar to the creatures in Stephen Kings Dreamcatcher especially when the mouth or head is open. The idea of the worm and how it gets into the water supply at the very end is identical to the goal of the creatures in Dreamcatcher. The special powers of Eleven are pretty much the same as the special powers of Duddits in Dreamcatcher who also gets weaker and is dying slowly during the movie. I was anticipating Eleven would transform into another creature to tackle and defeat the creature here that didn't quite happen but she was able to destroy it and herself together again the same result as what happens in the end of Dreamcatcher. Also in the first half of this scene when the kids are using the slingshot to fire stones at the creature this is exactly what the kids do in IT instead they are firing pieces of silver at Pennywise. I had to laugh at the morgue scene with the fake body again an exact copy of the idea from a classic Horror movie of the late 80's called Society. I think the mini series is very well done but clearly has no original ideas and just shows how underestimated and under appreciated Stephens Kings IT & Dreamcatcher are. You could say there are elements of The Goonies & ET in here too as well as The Species series of movies but mainly its IT & Dreamcatcher combined. The only new element in the series is ""The Upside Down"" which seems very like what happens in Insidious. I'm not complaining that its crap because its not original and its impossible nowadays to be original anyway but it seems most people I've talked to about this series either have never heard of IT or have forgotten most of that series and certainly never watched Dreamcatcher so they think this is original and think it deserves more credit than it actually does. Having said that the fact that the directors would try to emulate Stephen King and are excited about the big screen remake of IT tell us that they wanted to recreate what was done before and try to capture the atmosphere of a Stephen King mini series and I respect that being a big fan myself of his work. A lot of people say his books do not translate well into TV or movies which may explain why the rating for IT/Dreamcatcher are so much lower than Stranger Things however for me this show only makes me want to re-watch the classics and reminds how much better the older movies with original ideas were. Most of the acting is good and characters are likable. There are some very predictable scenes for example the fight over the girl near the cinema complex and how you know straight away what the Christmas present is before the box is opened. Also you knew Barbs was going to cut herself somehow at the pool party. Its very nostalgic and worth a look and I'm glad I watched it as its looks sharp and authentic.",7
North America,"Even though I often find movies on IMDb overrated, I was expecting something good from this because of the 9.3. I am convinced that this is a case of the people rating something highly be cause it seems like it should be good. yes, its got lots of references from the 80s, but that does not mean its any good. We'll start with the worst dialogue ever. there were several places where the writings was so bad and you could actually see it straining to be funny. Worst in this department were the three screechy kids. One of them was a kind of hybrid character of GOONIES' Chunk, and Stand by Me's Vern. The chemistry between him and the black kid just missed the mark, the dead pan was never deadpan enough and the ""clever dialogue"" bits fell flat. although I' admit the other kid actually seemed to fit in the time and place being represented. Winona Ryder. She is so hit and miss. There are moments when she seems quite believable as the character but at other times ....just not. Worst though, might be the lack of originality, with ideas being stolen from all sorts of 80s titles. The 80s atmosphere felt less like the 80s and more like some a version of what a current have imagined it would be like from their distorted 2016 perception.",2
North America,"For three episodes I tried and tried to like this ... But to keep a mystery like this going you have to have interesting characters ... And NONE of these were ... And they ain't pretty either ... Poor old Winona Ryder looks rough as hell in a cast that either looks inbred or suffering from an eating disorder !!! ... So along with a bad cast, well, nothing of interest happens In fact nothing much of anything happens ... A series of cliche's ( rather than the reworking of 80s tropes as the makers would try to have you believe ) plod out on the screen in an increasingly less interesting manner ... Visually it is tired and uninventive ... I gave it 2 and a half hours of my life and all this mediocre fluff has proved to me is that I have a lot better things to do with it than bother wasting another 5 finding out where this clunker is going",2
North America,"I really don't get what the excitement is about this series. For me, the plot stumbles from one cliché to the other (people may call it ""references to the 80's"" but forget that the 80's were the most boring period in the past 50 years). Acting is quite awful - Winona Ryder horrid. David Harbour is probably the best from the bunch. All the high school backdrop is awfully tedious and cliché-ridden. The merits of this series are only the cinematography (even though we've seen all those tricks before as well) and the way in which a certain level of suspense is effectively created. No need for a second season here. Please just cancel the show.",6
North America,"If you enjoy horror and thriller staff, this one is what you are looking for. Despite the fact that I didn't fall in love with the story, I liked the atmosphere a lot and it simply drags us back to the old times- you know, no smartphones, no internet etc. Everything you focus is the people themselves and how they act.*** SPOILER ALERT *** I mean you can create a story that is related to the parallel universes and physics, yet this sort of faceless monsters simply ruin the shows. Even if that is for the 'horror' and the 'mystery' part, something more humanoid would make the series more realistic, therefore scarier.",8
North America,"I just saw Stranger Things and I liked it. Stranger Things is a new Netflix mini-series set in the early 1980s. The first season deals with the mysterious disappearance of a little boy named Will, a sinister government organization and a little girl with psychic powers.It's good to see Winona Ryder in something big again. I know she has been in other things but I haven't paid much attention since Girl Interrupted. That was the last Winona Ryder movie I can recall watching.It truly felt like something from the 1980s, from the music to the sets. It also had the right ambiance- that particular style of Gothic atmosphere that recent horror has lost. It felt like a 1980s science fiction / horror / fantasy with a bit of mystery. Unlike American Horror Story it did not rely heavily on gore or sex. You could have convinced me it was made in the 1980s.Since Stranger Things was so successful I hope other horror and scifi projects imitate it. I often hate when something popular is leeched but this is a style of film making I had missed.Noticeable Homages and references: Stand by Me / The Body, Firestarter, Carrie, The Shining, Stephen King's It, Sometimes They Come back, Poltergeist, The Thing, H. P. Lovecraft, Star Wars, E.T: the Extraterrestrial, Dungeons and Dragons, The Hobbit, Lord of the Rings, Evil Dead, The Twilight Zone (two episodes: The Monsters are due on Maple Street and Little Girl Lost), Nightmare on Elm Street, Watcher in the Woods, and even Let the Right One In (The girl going by the name El (short for Eleven) and how The Bullies were handled).The one thing that I felt made Stranger Things shine above American Horror Story is that Stranger Things is not excessively sexual or gory. It has just enough gore where the gruesome scenes do horrify you and stick with you but there is also a subtlety so that your imagination can take over and you do not become desensitized to things. You actually form an emotional connection to the characters and care what will happen to them. There's also enough mystery left to make you hungry for more and for your imagination to run wild about certain details.I liked it a lot. My one complaint has to do with the flicker light effect in the very first scene and later in high abundance in the final episode. I do NOT recommend anyone with Epilepsy watching Stranger Things, at least not the first scene of the first episode or large parts of the season finale. I'm somewhat photosensitive myself (though I don't have seizures from it) and I was bothered by the constant flashing in the final episode, I say this as someone who does NOT have epilepsy, I know it would be far worse for those of you that do have the condition. The first scene was bearable though it was a relief when it was over with but the final episode's flickering lights was dragged on and on and on. They also had unnecessary jump scares and some wall ghost CGI that unfortunately reminded me that yes, this was recently made (and would have looked better entirely done with practical effects). But otherwise I loved it.I recommend Stranger Things to anyone who likes 1980s horror, scifi or fantasy. If you miss traditional horror in a semi-modern setting this is the show for you. I personally would have preferred more supernatural / fantasy elements as opposed to the X-Files-esque pure Science fiction but I found it likable. There are lot of classic tropes and clichés that some of us adore. And some of the tropes are turned on their head- like expecting the one character to end up with the girlfriend of the bully, or that bully showing he actually has depth and can grow as a person. That one, in particular, was a wonderful and welcome twist on the 1980s film stereotype. I liked Stranger Things and I hope it's second season is equally enjoyable.",8
North America,"First off, I'm going to say that I did enjoy the show. The acting was good, the music was top notch, and the cinematography was great! So why did I give it a 7/10? Quite simply it's plot is simplistic, it isn't that scary or suspenseful when it claims to be and I found the majority of the characters bland. I only really cared about the cop, Jim Hopper and the kid, Dustin. Everyone else wasn't really given a second thought until they reappeared on screen.At some points I forgot the plot was about the main group of kids trying to find out what happened to their friend as it ping-ponged around between the characters so much, I actually got a headache, and this is coming from someone who understood the ending to BioShock: Infinite.When you break it down, the story is mainly driven by nostalgia, a lot of it will go over people's heads who weren't born in the 70s/early 80s. And when there were subplots, I felt like they were somewhat unnecessary and/or executed poorly. For example, Nancy's motivation. After her friend Barbara disappears, she starts her own investigation along with Jonathan Byers. This (predictably) ends with a form of romantic tension which actually doesn't lead anywhere as Nancy stays with her actual boyfriend Steve (Who's for lack of a better term: A nob) who (Also predictably) does a somewhat lackluster heroic twist during a final confrontation by assisting Nancy and Jonathan against the... monsterThis is another down-point for me, not only do they make the mistake (Mistake in my eyes, it can be done well) of revealing the monster in it's fullest. It's also a generic black Wendigo-ish design with a head that opens like a dog from Resident Evil. Set in a story where they try and make everything suspenseful, they just go ahead and show you the beast. The best form of horror is when the audience fabricates the monster themselves, let us hear it, see a sudden silhouette move in the background, let us see their destruction, but don't let us see THEM.All in all, you should give this a watch, it's a good summer binge. Easily done in one sitting. It's enjoyable, in some instances, fun. But it's simply over-hyped and overrated when it comes to it's praise. Like I said, it's main drive is nostalgia which doesn't sit well with me.This reason this review covered mainly negative aspects of the show is because, as it's a *Spoiler Review* I'm assuming you've already watched it and are therefore in other peoples opinions on the show. You've probably heard all the praise in the world for it, hence my recommendation of the show, but cover the negatives.",8
North America,"Stranger Things is a original Netflix series. Expetations were high and hype was real. Well, Netlfix truly nailed it and this was worth of hype. This series had elements of E.T, X-Files, Twin Peaks, Stand By Me and many 80s high school movies. Great mixture and true nostalgia trip to the 80s. I have always been a very special relationship with sci-fi and horror so I think that's why I liked this so much. This is like a Spielberg style adventure and Stephen King style horror. Yep this show is sometimes very terrifying and not for the little kids.One of the biggest makers of Stranger Thing's awesomeness are truly spectacular acting performanes. This is like Game of Thrones. Everyone do breathtaking work to adults to the kids. I have to mention that I strongly believe that Millie Bobby Brown (who plays Eleven) will be a huge star in the future. Also David Harbour (who plays Hopper) is amazing. And everyone else. Winona Ryder makes a huge comeback to the top and this is her best performance in a long long time.I loved this show and i can't wait to see second season. English is not my mother tongue so sorry for possibly few mistakes.",10
North America,"Only saw the first episode and was floored. Had to review this!Story is awesome and the characters are freaking good. I mean for everyone that has watched anything they know how bad child actors are from the Walking Dead to the strain and basically every other show where there is a child actor... not here, i mean, they were freaking awesome. It is been so long with Carls and Maxes and whatever other **** child actors.Then there are the the props and direction, it is like watching a genuine freaking 80s stuff.so freaking good! max thumbs, tomatoes, freshness, whatever! bye",10
North America,"**** May contain strong spoilers ****Review made most out of episode 1.So. After about 2 years of conveying from a friend of mine (you know who you are) I finally got the interest up for watching a series. I turned it on. If you like me were around 10 years of age you certainly will see and experience things (stranger things? pun? Yeah!) in this one. After just a couple of minutes I recognize so much that I just were astonished. - The opening scene; the font as taken from McGyver or something. Spot on! - A doctor escapes a laboratory... a lethal hunt. - A gang of teenagers (see Goonies, E.T. and Stand By Me) in a role playing game. Dungeons and Dragons... here I come! - On the wall besides the game: a poster of the movie ""The Thing"" with Kurt Russell. (In episode 2; watch the wall as the guys is listening to Clash; there, the poster of Evil Dead!) - They all ride bikes with big light bulbs... hilarious! (Back to Goonies...?) I even got a bike with a long seat like the one in here. And... Ralph Macchio in ""The Karate Kid"" - A boy running away into the woods from some kind of monster. Cut to forest with a lot of...yes, that is correct; fog, fog and fog. Brings back memories from the horror movies in the eighties. - The music as the kids leaves on bikes brings memories back from the music era... and also into the game of ""The Last Ninja"" (first stage ""Into the Wilderness""... just listen on the synthesizers! Marvellous!) - A desperate and ""horrorfying"" situation with a phone... of course occupied on the other line and... yes.... dropping the old phone just hanging by the thread. All above in the first episode before the proper introduction come in play. - The introduction with the red neon lights and the music pushing the cast forward... wow... put me right into the movie of Manhunter and a nod to Michael Mann! - A strong ""filmatic and movie-ish"" strobe effect on the entire production and editing! Oh... give me back my child heroes! The Goonies... Sloth....were are you!? - My first big laugh: about 13 minutes into Stranger Things, episode 1. In the movie ""The Goonies"", there is Chunk. He has to do the dance before being let inside the house. Everybody is laughing. Here, the guy in the hat does the ""arm thing"", as a nod to Chunk! The character of Mike... like ""Hey, Mikey!"" in The Goonies! Excellent! - Oh...28 minutes into episode 1: ""Tickets to Poltergeist!"" Bazinga! Oh...sorry, I meant bullseye! - In The Goonies, when they find One Eyed Willy; the music is played out gently. Listen to that and listen to the keyboard sounds at 40:35 in episode 1. - Being personal here; I am a huge (and 62 exclamation marks) fan of the global phenomenon of the epic rock group TOTO (that also made Michael Jacksons ""Thriller"" around 1983, as for the year of ""Stranger Things""). And... voilá! 42 minutes into episode 1: ""It's gonna take some time to do the things we never had"". Magic... true magic! Like David Copperfield from 1983 touched the production there! Time: 42 minutes and 59 seconds; ""You're beautiful, Nancy Wheeler!"" and right into ""It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you..."" Then ""I bless the rains down in Africa..."", and cut to the rain outside of the house! Goosebumps, clap, clap, clap...goosebumps, clap, clap, clap! Wonderful screenplay, epic screen writing and a really fine moment of movie magic! - Episode 4; bad place... Sweden...sub zero! Laughed so hard!Keep your eyes open for references... Moments of Twin Peaks and Halloween. I am back into the eighties! Thank You, Matt and Ross Duffer!Over to the series as a product: - The production : Let me use an over used word: awesome! The music, the soundtrack, the sound effects, the camera angles, the costumes and clothes, the environment, the surroundings, the bicycles, the language, the phrases and slang... properly in place and genius! Hats off to this one! The title ""Stranger Things""... a better and more suited title would have made the production more rounded up. - The actors : Winona Ryder; question mark? Well... why Winona? I had preferred some other more intense and in depth actress. The rest of the cast is all in place, is delivering and that in a nice and great way. They all got their clear parts, and they sell it to the crowd and viewers. David Harbour is grasping the role perfectly; a tormented father that lost his daughter and now is the head of the town police. Slow and heavy, produced a solid character there, David Harbour! Matthew Modine evolves in the character and creates a both mysterious and dangerous role. - Entertainment : Starts off in a slow pace... mysterious...fiction...horror... nostalgia... and... boom! You are right in the middle of the story. Excellent entertainment. - Age : 11 or 15, depends of the company and the maturity of the individual.8,6 out of 10.",9
North America,"I could probably nitpick, but why bother, this is about as near perfect as film gets.I just call this ""film"", because traditional ""box office"" is dead. Cable (and apparently Netflix) is where motion picture entertainment is at. Box office just serves superhero comics and pseudo-artsy, vapid star appearances. ""Oooh, Leonardo DiCaprio has a beard, that sounds interesting!"". No, thank you, Hollywood.But there was a time when Hollywood was awesome, and Stranger Things extracts all that awesomeness, makes it fresh again, and presents it in a modern, appropriate format. With so many classic influences (I wont try to re-list all of them), it sound like it would be a mess of different genres, but it all really works perfectly together with this story and sci-fi-ish angle. I was expecting something convoluted, but the plot is straightforward and well-explained.The kids were so much better than the usual kid characters. Dustin was funny. 011 was serious (as someone waiting my whole life for a live-action Akira movie, this character gave me goosebumps). Luke reminded me of all my 80's childhood friends who aspired to be action heroes. And, as a side note - most movies today where you have characters of different races, they always have to have some banter acknowledging some racial tension - remember the 80s, when we didn't feel the need for that crap? Winona Ryder is criticized for being too this or too that - but this was a difficult role to play as a character experiencing things nobody can relate to. I thought she did awesome. The Chief of Police perfectly transitions from a typical, believable cop into an action hero you have to root for.It felt like this script was probably intended for a box-office movie, but they decided two hours is just not enough time to tell the story. Im glad it was made in the format it was, it was just perfect. So perfect, in fact, that I'm not looking forward to how they're going to ruin this masterpiece with a season 2. It is a complete story, and I don't feel the need for continuation. But, it looks like they know what they're doing, and I'll end up watching it either way.",10
North America,"Adventurous plot and the acting is done well, however, with the exception of Rider, Barbour, and one of the child actors, very little sympathy can be garnered for the other characters....the over acting and unbelievable over the top behavior breaks the sense of reality the writers hoped to accomplish....problems with the plot development. Secondary plot involving teen love is weak which dilutes the primary premise. The artistic license inventing the risks that the characters is not plausible leaving the viewer with a sense of frustration trying to reconcile the behavior leaving one to loose empathy for all the characters....very unrealistic. It a shame that the actors were saddled with a plot that nearly trumps their attempts to pul it off.Too bad...it could have been a winner.",5
North America,"This show got me hooked right from the get go and after binge watching it and the re watching it again it still is an amazing programme.The story-line this show has is probably one of the best ones at the moment as it makes sense and isn't confusing to watch, I haven't seen a show that has gripped me as much as this one did so quickly and that it didn't take forever to get an answer as well made this show perfect for me to watch.The way this show has been made and the effects and visuals honestly were amazing to watch each and every episode, the art work in this was amazing.I honestly hope they are making another series of this as I love every second of it.",10
North America,"For a few weeks now, Stranger Things, Netflix's newest ""original"" series has received the kind of buzz that only a new Netflix show can seem to manage these days. It's been recommended to me by just about everyone, and when I finally sat down to watch it, I found myself in a really weird mixed head space. Because at the core of it, I love the show. There is so much to praise it for. But after every episode, I found myself wondering, often times aloud and to anyone who would listen, why it works. Because I can't seem to get around the notion that it absolutely should not work.for my full review, visit https://barrysreview.wordpress.com/2016/08/15/stranger-things/",8
North America,"A homage to every 80s movie you could possibly think of, Stranger Things nevertheless stands up as an enjoyable and satisfying piece of work in its own right.Most of the characters in the show are interesting and well-acted. Central to the story is a group of somewhat nerdy young friends, who behave and interact like real kids. It's absolutely delightful watching them navigating their way through the bizarre story.The episodes are shot extremely well, and the directors keep an excellent grip on the tone throughout, which manages to intermingle tension, creepiness and light-heartedness seamlessly.However, this show has received somewhat over-exuberant praise. The show does not simply nod towards previous horror/sci-fi works - it actively recycles elements to such an extent that very little here can be claimed as original. Furthermore (without wishing to spoil the plot), the mystery which is revealed to underpin the plot is somewhat shallow. The 'bad guys', such as they are, are neither nuanced or fleshed-out and the viewers are left with absolutely no interest in them. Although the show successfully reaches a satisfying narrative conclusion within its eight episodes, ultimately there's nothing very complex here.This is well-made sci-fi/horror which is absolutely delightful and charming to watch, whilst also being creepy, tense and gripping. It can be appreciated by people without any interest in the 80s nostalgia indulgence with which the show is associated (most of all, it reminded me of the more recent series Fringe). Lovers of good film and TV will enjoy watching this, but a 'masterpiece' it is not.",8
North America,"That isn't a Stephen King series!!!!I was actually shocked that the great author wasn't involved in this show, everything about it SCREAMS Stephen King!The opening title is font from his paperbacks and there are references to his books through out from fear of clowns to the books actually making cameo! The style will remind you of the mini-series for the book (IT).... A lot!I generally don't like child actors but the Duffer brothers made it work!The series is set in the 80's with all the geeky references from your childhood, the one thing they got ""wrong"" was using modern music sometimes, I think it's a subtle reminder that you are indeed watching something new.Once you start watching you'll get hooked! it's impossible not to! A good thriller with an intense story line, believable dialogue and interesting characters.This is probably more Stephen King then his actual work!",9
North America,"Seriously loved this series.First off let's be honest, I'm an 80's man, so this gelled with me with ease.Even the guys who do the soundtrack are fantastic. The author, the musicians the director, the actors. This combination combines to form something which has been lacking for a long time. Something that get's me and that's appealing to both children and adults.This connected with me in so many ways and is off to an absolutely amazing start. I can't wait to see what happens next.The first season is in the vein of Steven Speilbergs Super 8, which was also one of the best movies he's ever done in my firm opinion.This series is like ET for a new generation with the added bonus it's set in an age that eliminates computers and mobile phones everywhere. An age were people connected and actually made friends, not just associates who keep them from there screens.Seriously fun, amazingly chilling and superbly atmospheric. I can't recommend it enough if you grew up with ET and loved 'Super 8'. If so, then your in for a treat. If not, then perhaps you'll find some new magic in story telling.",10
North America,"It's silent hill, slender man and ET all combined. I love horror flicks and this series is amazing! This is a drama suspense horror series and one of my top favorites. Whoever Rates this below an 8 doesn't know what they're talking about or didn't really watch it and give it the respect it deserves. When I started the series I could not stop, I watched the full series in on day. What can I say the acting and the whole cast was brilliant. I enjoyed it, I hope there's another season. I also hope the second season is good as the first one or even better. I just don't see how anything can be as good as the first one, but it would be awesome if they could keep it up. The casting, director and the producer were amazing.. great job Netflix!",10
North America,"The acting and the settings are awesome, I agree, but let's be honest, if this was not on Netflix, nobody would talk about it. It is not scary and I don't like horrors too much, and the plot with the kids seems very childish. It's not boring, but sometimes trying to be too atmospheric and it gets annoying with the blinking lights etc. I don't know, it was not bad, but I know about tons of better series. I feel like very little thing around the main plot is nailed, the atmosphere is awesome, but the plot itself seems average. I hate some parts with the kids, where it all seems forced, and the ending was very predictable. 7/10 is what I would give it.",7
North America,"The quality of the series is exceptional, everyone agrees on that. Filming, actors, all the things you can see are of the best quality.But today we have access to information, and don't believe in supernatural stories anymore, things we didn't know 20 years ago.So there's no point in cultivating theories long gone, not even for fun. I'm sure there are many good real world stories to be told. Most people live in a world of fantasy and will like the series.The series are cute, but just pure fantasy. If you came here for recommendation, as a rational person, I recommend not to watch, even though it's like The Goonies. Still not good enough.I hope that Netflix and others make more series on this 80's style, but with a proper story. 6 out of 10. Watchable once.",6
North America,"I've read the reviews - not all but enough. I've heard my friends talk about it. I was curious so even though I wasn't even remotely interested I decided to watch an episode. What I got was...""stranger things.""Wow. This show is so lame. I've heard people say it has the same atmosphere and feel from the 80's. It doesn't. They say it's like the new ""stand by me"" it's not. They say the kids are going on an adventure..maybe they are - but the adventure sucks. How do I know? I grew up in the 80's. I'm an 80's baby. This show sucks.The story line doesn't make me want watch another episode..it's like watching the X-Files when Chris Carter just gave up and started making those episodes with HUMOUR.Stranger things isn't scary, it isn't funny, it isn't interesting, it isn't anything new. The most interesting part of the show is the little girl and unfortunately the show is just so lame, I can't spend the time to figure out what happened to her because I just don't care.There are so many good shows and if you want to watch one with paranormal activity then watch Outcast on HBO. Now that's a show for an adult with drama instead of this PG13 trash.I'm not sure why people like this show..but it definitely doesn't get a 10..and Netflix did not ""do it again"" or ""get it right"" or ""bring real TV back"" or ""hit it out of the park""",1
North America,"This show is really great. It got my attention right away and I couldn't stop watching it, I finished the season in one day and cannot wait for the Duffer brothers to come up with season 2.The kids are really good actors and they sure do keep you gripped to the show.It's based in the 80s and was influenced by Steven Spielberg and Stephen King which I realized after watching a few episodes before I read it online. It has great soundtracks and really good cinematography shots.It's really cool how this Netflix series has gotten so much attention and great reviews. If you have not started watching, you definitely should get to it asap.",9
North America,"This is one of the series you have to watch. It feels like an old movie from Spielberg like E.T. or has a touch of Super 8. We we're totally hooked from the first Episode and couldn't stop watching it. Finally something else on the TV.If you love 80's style and mystery you're gonna love this show. The kids are acting superb and the effects are gorgeous. It makes you feel like a kid again, you can feel the tension between friendship and the action you always wanted as a kid. It sucks you right into their lives and stories.Love it!",9
North America,"I found that I didn't really enjoy this series as much as I was hoping to.It was obvious the creators had put a LOT of thought into the entire thing, it really shows, but if their intention was to create a show aside from the whole '80s thing, a lot of the effort was misplaced.While it does do a great job of being an '80s homage, if that's not something you're already excited by, this show may be a little disappointing. While interesting to see an '80s world on TV ~30 years after the '80s, if you don't really care about the '80s that much or have a heap of nostalgia for it, it may feel like the show is dragging on a little.I will say that this eases up after the first 2-3 episodes, and a lot of this could be regarded as ""World building"" or ""Setting up the plot"", but a lot of it DOESN'T contribute to the plot, and as such, it feels like there's someone following you around saying ""... hey.... guess what..... this show's set in the '80s."" in literally every moment of every scene.While I enjoyed the final 2 episodes very much, I feel like the things that occurred in the plot would have had just as much impact with about half of the build up... in about every story line that was followed. I also feel like it would have played into the whole '80s homage a lot more if there was much more ""Spielberg Kiddie Flick"" action outside the final 2 episodes as well.One thing I will commend the writers on is the characters themselves. Unlike the plot, the balance between character and '80s trope has a really good balance, with the joys of modern standards written in really well. No character is overly stupid or overly smart, they're all stereotypes of another era, but they very rarely actually feel cliché or annoying. Props to them for that! Probably one of my favourite viewings in regards to characters.In the end, I did enjoy it, but with much of the plot ignored for nostalgia-tugging, I don't feel this is as much of a watch as others are saying it is.",7
North America,"Well, I don't think I wasted my time when I decided to watch this show. It was interesting, it was good and it brought something new. But to be honest, I saw the other comments about it before watching and now I can say it is not THAT good. Sometimes it is slow, sometimes it is not logical, sometimes it is just another Teen Show and there are many clichés. It was a good entertainment but it was not a surprising show, it didn't make me anxious for the finale and for the result as some other series did. It was possible to predict many things that happened, so I was rarely surprised by the way the plot went. So, you can watch it, but don't expect a 9,1 TV Show (The rate this moment).",7
North America,"Stranger Things is a sci-fi horror series on Netflix created by the Duffer Brothers (Wayward Pines). I had been hearing nothing but praise for this eight part series from friends and family, and now I know why. It is a clever tribute to movies and TV series of the 80s.In the small town of Hawkins, Indiana, in the year 1983, 12-year-old Will Byers (Noah Schnapp) mysteriously disappears one night. Will's mother Joyce (Winona Ryder), police chief Jim Hopper (David Harbour), and his three friends Mike (Finn Wolfhard), Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) and Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin) set out to search for where he could have gone. To make matters more complicated, a strange girl with psychokinetic powers is discovered by Will's friends the following day. Could she hold the key to where Will may have vanished?The series plays out as an affectionate homage to all the stereotypes and tropes of 1980s films such as E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial, Stand By Me and The Lost Boys. The theme song itself sounds like something composed by Director John Carpenter. I really enjoyed the sense of mystery and suspenseful atmosphere that was emanating throughout each episode. I must give credit to the Duffer Brothers for the way they were able to capture the overall feel of an 80s movie. The acting was great as well, especially from all of the child actors and Winona Ryder. I just hope the series will be picked up for a second season.I rate the first season 8.5/10.",9
North America,"In India, Netflix isn't a phenomenon that people would have easy access to and we only hear of good shows either by word of mouth or social media. Thanks to FB for propagating heavily on 'Stranger Things'. Read few lines about the show and browsed through IMDb to know all that could feed my interest. Finally started watching it online couple of days back and already started with the fifth episode. Honestly, I never thought there could be a show to hook me like TWD did. From the performances, to actors and the whole environment of the show is what you need after very decade or two to take you back to the good old days of fantastical childhood. As much as it has been said, the show kept reminding me of Goonies and ET and Super 8 and Stephen King and Steven Spielberg and blah blah. I can only thank Duffer Brothers for not being shortlisted to direct the new 'IT' film or this jewel of a show would have taken more time to come to us. It has a sense of sweetness, calmness and dread and thrill at the same time. There is something about 80s that never gets old and looks even better on screen. After I am finished watching it, I am definitely doing a marathon of it for Halloween with dim lights and my pumpkin pie.For those who are still contemplating about it, just don't wait and try watching the first episode. I promise, you would be glued to it like I am and many others.",10
North America,"Stranger Things an ambitious project by the Duffer Brothers finally brought to life by Netflix after being rejected by every single network approached deserves the feverish viral status it has received. As a 32 year old I avidly watch Game of Thrones, Sherlock and many other shows which many consider to be the best of the decade but none have moved me so far as Stranger things has. In an amazing story line the Duffer brothers make you glue your eyes to the screen and hurriedly click next episode as soon as one finishes. While managing to bring three different stories with 3 unique genre styles the show manages to embrace you for 8 sweet hours before gently laying you back into the real world feeling anguished that you cannot relive it again. Despite loving shows like Band of Brothers, Breaking Bad never before has a show been so gripping that I would watch it 2 in a row in the space of 3 days. Even while writing this I feel the need to go back to Netflix and watch it again. Acting and filmography are top notch with absolute stellar from the main actors who are children which is extremely rare nowadays. It was also an added pleasure to see Winona Ryder return to the screen anchoring this show with top notch acting. If I could rate this show higher than 10/10 I would as I know this will most likely stay in my top ten go to shows for suggestions for a long long time.",10
North America,"Okay, unless you are a millennial or younger, you can't help but notice the aesthetic allusions in Stranger Things to classic 80's works such as Altered States,E.T, Firestarter, Red Dawn, and Aliens. Not to mention borrowing thematic story elements from The X-files (including the theme music), as well as your choice of 80's teen angst drama. But the sum of the parts definitely adds up to a warm and cozy familiar feeling in this series not seen since those heady days when computer technology first impacted the culture en mass.In this review, I was going to warn of spoilers, but I have rescinded that idea because I am only going to talk about one story line that was completely unnecessary, misguided, and ultimately abandoned by the writers. What about Barbara? She is the second victim in this mystery, but she is given short shrift by the whole town, who are focused solely on finding/saving the young boy. By including that story line, and then essentially foregoing it, it really made the rest of the characters (save Nancy) seem morally duplicitous. Why even include it? I suppose there was only so much story to cram into 8 episodes, so something had to give, but it just should have been written out completely from the start.",7
North America,"Stranger Things is a very well-made show. The acting is fantastic (especially from the children), it's cinematography is beautiful and it's great at creating a feeling of dread.By all means, Stranger Things should be phenomenal, but it has one huge flaw, a flaw which I believe derails the show.The Duffer Brothers claim the show is a love-letter to 80s Sci-Fi. After watching this show, I can confirm that The Duffer Brothers have no idea what a homage is.A homage shows respect to a previous decade/genre, but Stranger Things doesn't do that. Stranger Things goes the Scary Movie/Seth MacFarlane route of excessively referencing other works. This wouldn't be such a problem if the references weren't so blatant or frequent.The show loves to name drop (""Maybe she's an escaped loony?"" ""Just like Michael Myers!"", ""I was making out with Chrissy Carpenter.), place movie posters in the background or foreground (The Thing, The Evil Dead) or sometimes even lift scenes directly from other works (The scene where Mike hides Eleven from his mother is almost identical to a scene in E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial).Stranger Things feels like it was created by that one annoying kid everybody knew who thought he was so cool because he had some knowledge of popular culture before his time.A big disappointment for somebody who was hoping for a lot more.",6
North America,"Those who criticize the show stating that it lacks originality are right - it's yet another scary story about a monster hunting residents of a small town. But if you serve this unoriginal plot in a way it has been served by the Duffer brothers, the results is pretty amazing. The soundtrack, which accompanies most of the key moments of each episode, doesn't let you forget that the action takes place in the 1980s, and in my opinion it is one of the most important factors that makes the show great. Another advantage is the way all the key characters are set up. In the very first episode we can get to know their personalities due to an amazing performance of the exceptionally talented actors and the witty dialogues between them. I've never thought I'd be into that type of show but I'm more than happy that gave it a try.",10
North America,I never write reviews here.But this show deserves one!It is great to see something that is being produced today that gives you that real feeling that you had when you watched movies in the 80's or 90's. No filters no extreme computer animation just this raw movie feeling. I always like to compare this to the first Die Hard movies. Because they gave me this feeling to.The show itself is amazing good acting and a truly great story. An absolute must for everyone that likes mystery and Syfy.I hope that more movies and series in the future go back to this old school style / technique.,10
North America,"I'm a sucker for 80s nostalgia, so I was excited when I heard about Stranger Things. The show is a homage to the movies and books of that decade, with references to Stand By Me, The Goonies, E.T., Poltergeist, Nightmare on Elm Street, Alien, Commando, among many others. It's good, thrilling popcorn entertainment that, no, is not the best series ever created, but does the job of keeping you entertained and interested.The one thing I really like about this series is how humanized all the main characters are. You have the four main protagonists, geeky preteen boys who live by the codes of the comic books they read. They communicate on walkie talkies, transport themselves on dirt bikes, snack on pudding, and basically know all the ""secret spots"" of their Anytown USA setting. You have the ""little miss perfect"" older sister who rebels for the first time and dates the popular jock. You have the divorced mother who is barely keeping it together while raising her two sons. You have the older brother who doesn't trust authority. You have the moody cop who hates his current life. Then, of course, you have Eleven (""El""), the superhuman little girl who wants a normal life and some Eggos. The acting is actually very well done and you immediately grow to like all the characters, except maybe the bullies.I do have a few bones to pick. One, some of the writing is weak and not fully flushed out, resulting in stories not going anywhere, some disappearing without notice, and others slightly corny and clichéd, which at times can be charming (this is suppose to be the 80s, after all), and other times eye rolling. Also, some of the action seems anti-climatic, with resolutions seemingly way too easy. The other thing too is the show toes a thin line between homage and plagiarism. I think for the most part it keeps the balance, but some parts it gets dangerously close. I also have some concerns of this going another season. This seems more mini-series than not, but I'm curious as what direction the show will go in the new season. Will it be the same story and characters? Same characters and new story? New stories and new characters? I guess we wait and see.Overall, Netflix put together a great summer series. Heat warming, thrilling, nostalgic, I wish we could find that creativity of Spielberg, King, Craven and Lucas, among others, of the 80s that resulted in some of the most original work out there instead of superhero and remakes over and over.",7
North America,"We are in the 80s, in the small American town of Hawking, when Will Byers (Noah Schnapp) mysteriously disappears. In the meantime a little girl (Millie Bobby Brown) without a name is found by Mike Wheeler (Finn Wolfhard). All of these events seem to be connected and what starts as a simple missing person case slowly evolves into creating a chain of events that will find Hawking's police chief Jim Hopper (David Harbour) joining forces with Will's mother Joyce (Winona Ryder) to uncover what is really going on.Admittedly, that plot synopsis doesn't cover even half of it, but there is no need to know anything going into this, I went in without having literally any idea what this was going to be and, just like the rest of the world, ""Stranger Things"" caught me deeply and by surprise. I was not expecting the best season of television I have seen in the last years.This is incredible storytelling, this is the next big thing, a voice so original and unique you are swept away by the power of the emotional narrative. I will quote a sentence that sums up the show so perfectly it is hard not to bring it up: ""in Stranger Things the kids are in a Spielberg film, the teens in a Carpenter film and the adults are in a Stephen King film"". That basically outlines the brilliance of the show in one sentence. The molding of tones and atmospheres is seamless, at no point I felt like the creators were bluntly copying off of any of their inspirations.Many have talked about how this show is such an homage to the 80s and the storytellers of that time, but I think that that comes into play only as a consequence of the storytelling, which is why it works. The first thing these writers worry about nailing is the characters and what an incredible ensemble we are presented to. There are no stereotypes, no clichés, no archetypal figures, every single on of these people is three dimensional, we get behind every character, we believe in their world and we root for them. The complexity of the dynamics that is brought to life with such clarity is indicative of the evident passion the creators had for this project.The scene weave is just unbelievable, how plot and story manage to forward each other, building a building a narrative that grows and culminates in a beautiful resolution which once again avoids any type of predictions and presents itself as original as the whole series. Anyone accusing the writers of having excessively borrowed from the 80s is only trying to bit*h around. The originality of the series is unbelievable and it is sure to produce a great deal of imitators, just as every time such a new and fresh voice comes to life.The writing merits here are off the charts, definitely something worth studying, and the directors deserve deep recognition for how brilliantly and completely the vision on the page is brought to the screen. The cinematography is so stylish, it molds 80s dynamics with modern technology without ever calling attention to itself. The score and soundtrack could not have been more spot on. The theme of the show encapsulates perfectly what the whole thing is about, it nails it down perfectly and when that theme is heard for the first time you will know you are in for something special.What it also comes down to is how powerful the themes explored are thanks to a story world that lends itself so brilliantly to them. This is one of the best portrayed friendships of recent years, but the themes go well beyond that. The power of love over hate is a theme that is carried over into all of the story lines and has different manifestations in all of them and when they are all brought together the impact on the viewer is truly special. Other than being so smart and affectionate, the series was probably most memorable for me for how moving it was in its small yet powerful moments.And we haven't even started talking about the actors yet. Whilst every single one of them deserves loads of praise on his or her own, for me the scene stealer is hands down David Harbour. I did not know he was this good of an actor, this is world class acting. He brings to life a character, subverting every possible expectation we had about him and ultimately creating a person that feels incredibly real. The only complaint I have is that Winona Ryder struggled through the first half of the show being very one note and giving a flat portrayal of her struggles.""Stranger Things"" was incredible, it was overwhelming in its originality and whilst I am still not sure on whether I want a season two or not, I will forever cherish the experience I had with this treasure of a tale.",5
North America,"You must be out of your mind to miss this.If you grew in the 80's then this brings you back to those cool times playing with your mates, building dens and just being out doors. No phones no internet. Really listening to music.To those of you who missed the 80's this says it all. Obviously our monsters weren't as real.The feel of this series is great, brilliant story lines keeping you hooked at every corner. Perfectly cast.I've just watched episode 7 and not once through the series so far have I reached to check my phone to look at crap I don't really need.Oh how I wish I was back in the 80's. We had style.Love little mum dent",10
North America,"I watched the whole series with great disappointment. The acting was bad, the script very amateur, the sound/noise very irritating, the cinematography horrible, the story weak and confusing, and the whole thing just a mess. I kept watching all eight episodes thinking that based on all the rave reviews surely there was something I was missing here. I think this might be among the worst TV series I have ever watched. I had heard the Duffer brothers interviewed on NPR's ""All Things Considered"" and I was drawn in thinking this was going to be great. I need to exorcise this somehow from my weekend. It was a waste of time and looking back painful to watch. I realize people have different tastes and clearly many people love this series but I honestly have to differ and can not recommend it at all, even on a very boring day with nothing else to do.",1
North America,"Wow... I would like to start this review with a Wow. Why? Because it is a amazing series! Every minute of the series is just perfect!I love the style of the 80's. I did not grew up in the 80's or something but if i see the series, i would like to grew up at that time. The anger the communism gave and things, i like the temper.Also the casting for this series is phenomenal, i mean i never saw a group of young children act like this, it was so good. And to be honest i have a little crush on the older sister Nancy, because holy mama she looks good!This series comes close to my all time favorite Twin Peaks. Twin peaks is still my favorite because of the fact that Twin Peaks did make me lose some sleep at night and Stranger Things doesn't do that with me. But overall i would like to thank Netflix for the amazing series they made.",10
North America,"I wanted to watch this show I had read so much about. I knew that reading the raving positive reviews would probably ruin it for me, I entered the upside-down with an open mind. It started off nice, set the story and characters firmly in place and proceeded on a constant slow pace, developing certain characters and story-lines all along until the end. What got me hooked on though was the mystery of it all and how the show will tie up the individual character stories. It did an okay job in that department and I feel like it could've been so much more. The overall story stood mediocre but gripping, throughout the eight episodes. Some of the characters introduced were unnecessary. Winona Ryder's, and the kids' acting was over the top at some points while David Harbour was a rock, perfect fit for the role. For a story based in the 80's, the slang that the kids use felt out of place, like the show's music. While I enjoyed the show, it left me feeling like I was missing out on something. People I know were going crazy about it and I just thought it was okay. Maybe I shouldn't have read the reviews beforehand, but the show needed a bit more work on the story and dialogue to be termed as ""Masterclass"".My Rating: 7/10 +1 for nostalgia. ""Should I stay or should I go""",7
North America,"Wow, anyone who has seen Winona Ryder act over the years would agree she is a good actor.But in this series she is incredible.I believe this is the best work of her career.She plays the character so convincingly, and so completely that it just draws you into the entire premise of the series.The other actors do a great job too. I'd say 8-9/10.Overall, a fantastic series. Great work funding this Netflix!Every episode gets better and better.The other actors who are outstanding are the boys in the Goonies gang. Equally convincing.A top series.",10
North America,"Stranger Things is a witty, affectionate and nostalgic look back at the 80s horror/brat pack movie. Geeky kids on a mission to rescue their friend, adults who are deliberately colourless or non-existent parents (Winina Ryder excepted) or alternatively evil men in suits. Hazmat or business, suits are not to be trusted. White coats are also to be avoided. And avoid they do - on bikes of course - with a little help from a special power. Sound familiar? The parallels with ET are obvious but references to cult 80s movie abound - the evil force in the parallel universe (Poltergeist), the search that follows the train tracks (Stand by Me), the jock vs geek teen love interest (Heathers, Pretty in Pink) and maybe a nod to the smoky hallway finale in Assault on Precinct 13. Stranger Things is an entertaining ride - just the right amount of shock - and the kids as main protagonists is engaging without being cringe worthy. No doubt some will point out that kids avoiding baddies on bikes is unlikely and unrealistic, that no one can hide a superpower in their basement den for days on end without the parents knowing. Well, they did it in the 80s so it must be possible and frankly who cares if it's not. It was fun. If this was the 80s the soundtrack album would be a killer - The Clash, Echo and the Bunnymen, Joy Division, New Order. A thoroughly enjoyable trip down memory lane and an affectionate punch (look it up).",8
North America,"This show really deserves 12 stars, not 10, for brilliance in every category. Spielberg fans will recognize lots of references to ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" ""E.T.,"" and J.J. Abrams' ""Super 8"" (itself a huge Spielberg reference), but this is a good thing. Humankind's fear of the dark probably dates back to before shadows flickered at the edges of nighttime campfires in the mouths of caves, and ""Stranger Things"" exploits that fear masterfully. The story combines fear, horror, loss, different kinds of love, and the right amount of heart into a perfectly balanced mixture. Then when you are sure you know what will happen in the next shot, a twist surprises you.Television does not get better than this: there is not an ounce of fat anywhere in the storytelling; the editing is superb, especially the scene transitions; and the entire cast are fabulous. Winona Ryder, always a strong actress, does an outstanding job of portraying the emotional journey her character experiences, but everyone else is perfect in their roles as well -- the casting department deserves major kudos here.If you don't have a Netflix subscription, get one now. And settle in for a binge...and don't blink.",10
North America,"This is a very bad show. The only way Im thinking people like this,is only if they are teens or so much younger than even that. Is not a good show for anyone who is over 22. There are some good parts, but the show has bad graphics and stupid children lines and the girl is just awful. Nothing is believable about it and everything is predictable . Don't watch it if u are over 22.U will love it if u are a teen or younger.I will definitely not watch season 2. P.s. don't get yourself fooled by the high IMDb note, i bet only teens voted most of that. The only good actor there is the mother and she is great for sure. Maybe if there were older kids, at least 18 or so, the show would have been great.",1
North America,"The fantastic thing about this series is the children. Terrific, scene-stealing performances from all four of them. Nailed nerdy boys, abused girl, budding romance, and everything in-between.But the story itself -ugh? Derivative drivel. A federal institution with this level of interest is handled poorly by a small cadre of ""scientists."" If this kind of operation were to occur, it would be handled in a much more sophisticated manner, even back in the day. The kids out-running the police story device is not believable. Just too many warmed over tropes.Harbour's hard-bitten, sullen demeanor feels dialed in. Winona plays what seems to me a high-pitched parody of Owen Wilson. Neither of their performances moved me positively. Paired together they are almost believable. Even then, that they succeed where better trained personnel fail miserably is just sophomoric.The kids compel - the story is poor and the adults are merely staging.",3
North America,"This is a mash-up of Goosebumps series, with a dash of cult and a generous flashback to the 80's. Reminds me of The Goonies. Reminds me of E.T. Reminds me of M83.It's confusing at first - I'm 33. So I can relate with everything here.One of the kid looks like Macaulay Culkin. Familiar. The chief is like a lovechild of young Jack Nicholson and Dexter (Michael C. Hall). Winona Ryder looks like Winona Ryder. ""Should I stay or should I go?"" and many other synth M83-like sound. Bald, adorable, bad-ass girl escaping from lab. The monster is ... basic monster you'd imagine whenever you read teen horror novels. Tacky and predictable ending.So I'm confuse whether this is for teenagers or adults like me.On the fair side - it's nice and entertaining. I like how I don't have to think too much and just enjoy those cute kids running around in the forest chasing monsters. Makes me miss my childhood and how I used to enjoy those cheesy Goosebumps serials.",6
North America,"Imagine the nostalgic memories you may rekindle from films like E.T. and The Goonies. Now drop your happy memories into a dark ""Silent Hill"" dimension.Watching this show made we want to go back and rate every other title at 9 out of 10. This series knocked it out of the park.Thank you to The Duffer Brothers and Netflix for working to bring us fun piece of work.I hope if there is a season 2, it will survive expectations. This show really raised the bar IMHO.This series sent me on a 80's binge. Today's pick for viewing was ""flight of the navigator""",10
North America,"I'll start right out with my reason for 8/10 as opposed to 10/10. In my personal opinion one thing all stories should explain especially mysteries is the how and why. The how and why is murky at best which left me feeling a bit confused about a few things.With that in mind, I watched this entire series in one day. For ten or so hours nothing mattered except bathroom breaks and snack refills. I kid you not, the very phrasing of the first chapter's title makes you feel like ""Ok we're going on a ride here"". Then there's the method they used to introduce the series title. Talk about a blast from the past! From then on, just be prepared to be transported to a different time. The set pieces alone are done well enough to give this a gander.One thing this series did well was mixing ""well known"" actors with people you literally never heard of. It has a great pull where the Winona Ryders reel you in and the new comers keep you there, knowing you don't have to see the same old style from the same old people, but also knowing you don't have to invest a lot of trust into a whole cast of newbies. The kids especially do a phenomenal job. While a bit cliché at times, considering their age, they were fantastic. You'll see almost immediately that Millie Bobby Brown is in a class of her own.Another thing I liked about this series considering it's a Netflix Original is that they didn't take advantage of the lack of censorship. There are no unnecessary sex scenes, every other word isn't a swear, and there's not a whole bunch of random drug use or killing. But not to the point where it seems like an after school special. It was simply done right.Now the general vibe of the series is very familiar as it pulls from just about every 80s sci-fi/horror movie you can think of. What they did well with that however is taking that familiarity and molding it into something new. I don't wanna get on a soapbox, but man was it nice to watch a movie about teenagers and not have it be them glued to their phones. I think whether anyone wants to admit it or not we all can use a break from the strangle hold social media has on us right now. Now that I think of it, I think that's why a lot of modern horror films don't work these days. Technology is all around us, so it's hard to suspend belief when you know that theoretically the entire world is one tweet away from witnessing a mystery taking place. In 1983 that was a different story.All in all I give it 8/10. Like I said, it locked me down for an entire day. The story is a good pace that keeps you interested. Some things probably could have been explained better, but who knows; as thorough as they were, some of the missing details was probably intentional. This is a good one for everyone. But if you're 30 and older and love a good nostalgia-esk experience, WATCH THIS SHOW!!",8
North America,"The Stranger Things is now one of the best shows out there, and has some fantastic special FX and story, and if you are from the 80s or earlier you will even like this show more.For me Stranger Things is a mixture between E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982), The Goonies (1985), and Poltergeist (1982), also movies i love.If you want a TV Show that gives you back the 80s feeling when you were young then this TV show is for you, it's funny it's trilling it has action and it's creepy, you will never get bored with this first season, After each episode, you long for more episodes.It's just like seeing E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982), The Goonies (1985), and Poltergeist (1982) for the first time.See it you will love it.",10
North America,"While I think this show is pretty good, it had things going on that left a bad taste in my mouth after the hype and excitement of seeing it had waned.1.- What were those experiments they were trying before 11 was born? What was their purpose? 2.- What were they trying to accomplish with eleven? They clearly stumbled upon the ""upside down world"" and the thing inside it, but what were they hoping to accomplish then? 3.- Why was the thing unaware of how to enter this world until eleven made her presence felt? The monster started opening portals left and right once it knew where the other world was. 4.- Why wasn't there any evidence of the monster opening a hole in the house's wall when it scared the mom?",8
North America,"Hopefully Stranger Things will add a second season, as the first was one of the best series I have ever enjoyed. Throw out any preconceived notions about whether it's ""hokey"" and try watching just two episodes. You have a better than 90% chance of enjoying it. I rolled my eyes at first, thinking: how could an 8-episode series of an '80s throwback be something worth watching? The previews showed influences of Close Encounters, E.T., Goonies and even Silent Hill, and I wasn't interested in embracing the nostalgic aspect. The opening credits really dug right into the 1980's, and even the title slid in as if it suggested that Stephen King's own name would burn into my LCD screen. I'll just get right into the meat and potatoes. All the players work, all the scenery, action, editing, and photography really create a great series. I can't think of any one episode that they could have thrown out, because they all really go well together. As for the kids, the one fear I have is that these child actors are getting older. They can't keep riding their bikes and talking with lisps. So I can't imagine that Stranger Things will have a long run, unless they wind up doing away with them, or changing up the story altogether. And that would be a shame because the talent of all those kids is DEEP. Take for example, Millie Bobby Brown (who plays El). So few words come out of her mouth, yet her expressions and emotions carry so well. The kids are like Our Gang - you just fantasize of becoming a kid again, grabbing your bike with its reflectors and streamers, and hanging out with them after school. One typically might expect that kids running about on their own to make things right in their neighborhood is rather hackneyed, but the writing and execution of the plot for each episode kept driving action, adventure, mystery and drama, without it ever feeling as if it were getting stale or bogged down. Even when the story had to explain things, the characters got right to the point and took action. Only a couple of the adults played central characters and they certainly did well also. Chief Jim Hopper and Joyce Byers are introduced as people with some shredded back stories, and the Duffer Brothers - the writers / directors - slowly peel back the layers of their pasts. I put Stranger Things beyond The Walking Dead and Peaky Blinders, into Breaking Bad territory - not to compare whether it's ""better"" than any of my favorites, because it's so different than any other series.",10
North America,While I realise that different strokes are for different folks for the life of me I am gob smacked how this has such high ratings. One could argue that this is simply a SciFi film but come on dudes this is at best a remake of ET except ET was actually quite a decent film.It is the biggest pile of rubbish I have ever watched. Slow in the beginning - even slower in the end. Acting is terrible and dialogue is pathetic. Seen a review that says only watch if you are U22 years of age. I sayDO NOT BOTHER TRYING TO GET INTO THIS. Utter tripe !! vs Wasting appoximatly 8 hours of your life,1
North America,"Stranger Things is the latest Netflix Original to take the world by storm and from what I heard of the show before I watched it I could guess why. From reviews it sounded like it was damn near perfect, an original concept with great writing, a well known actress leading the helm with some talented new faces thrown into the mix, and overall great direction and visuals. It sounded too good to be true and unfortunately it was, I strapped into the first two episodes ready to have my mind blown and came out the other end with my mind very much intact as I scratched it and wondered where I had saw this show before.To my dismay Stranger Things is not an original concept by any means, in fact it is the exact opposite of an original concept. Every single thing in show has been borrowed from every piece of media based in the 80's or classic sci-fi. At first it would seem as though Stranger Things merely pays homage to these classics and that would all be fine if that was the case but it's made painfully obvious the this show blatantly steals things from other pieces of media. The Twilight Zone, The X-Files, Goonies, E.T, Alien, a literal exact shot from Stand By Me, the list goes on. The reason no one notices this is the show blinds it's viewers with 80'S nostalgia forcing constant references and throwbacks so viewers will be saying ""hey Risky Business! I remember that movie!"" instead of ""Didn't they do something like this in an episode of Outer Limits?""This forcing of 80's pop culture also distracts the watcher from just how bad the writing is. The story holds up simply because it takes the best elements from other stories instead of actually coming up with their own spin on things but the rest of the writing seems sloppy. Dialogue can be hit or miss, sometimes it's perfectly fine, other times it's either really unnatural or just plain boring. Characters are in a similar situation, some are interesting, realistic and a joy to watch, others are bland, or in the case of Mike and Nancy's family, only exist when it's convenient. Not to mention the constant inconsistencies like how Eleven has no idea about the concept of friends or time yet she doesn't question teachers, bullies or anything else that happens in school or even the concept of school itself. She knows not to kill or hurt the school bully yet when she killed or hurt in the facility she was given affection.The direction is OK, it's not exactly bad but nothing really stands out about it either it captures the feel of the 80's well enough and establishes the tone but other than that visually the show is quite boring with a few exceptions. The music fits the tone perfectly and builds tension but just like everything else in the show it's pretty much a rehash of every sci-fi theme ever, like X-files or Twilight Zone.The show does have one stand out though and that's the acting. Every single actor gives it their all and I mean their all. Winona Ryder plays her part of the anxious mother who everyone thinks is crazy but really knows what's actually going on perfectly. David Harbour is so interesting as Police Chief Hopper and is easily my favourite character to watch, he is the character with the most depth and Harbour's acting talent really does show how troubled and determined Hopper is. The child actors also deserve a shout out because not only are they not terrible they're actually some of the best actors in the show. Even the poorly written characters like Nancy are acted well and make the dialogue and writing much more bearable, making it so I could actually get past the first two episodes and continue with the series.In the end, Stranger Things is just OK, it has quite a few redeeming qualities but it also has a lot of flaws. Really the worst thing about it is just how insulting it is to it's audience and how little effort has gone into something that is getting so much praise. Watch it if you like classic sci-fi and want to see an updated take on some of your favourite tropes but make sure to turn off your brain and not take it too seriously, just have fun with it.. But if you really want a homage to classic sci-fi done masterfully then I would suggest you look elsewhere, probably to Super 8.The real strange thing is how what should be just a fun, cheesy cult sci-fi show has somehow tricked everyone into thinking it's the next Breaking Bad.",5
North America,"Please follow in the footsteps of The Wire and keep this series to a few seasons instead of falling in the trap of so many other series. Please wrap this thing up after a few seasons instead of staging it out simply to make more money. Too many serious are only concerned with making money as opposed to wrapping up a good story. You have the making for an incredible sorry but please, please don't drag this out and follow the follow the footsteps of Prison Break and Lost.I love this series and would be remiss if you thought you had to keep producing more and more simply to make more money. Holy crap IMDb, how much more do you need from me before you will allow this to be published. This clearly wasn't enough so screw you and your ten line minimum. Who can't write a concise review in under ten lines? Apparently I can't, which is why you aren't allowing this review to go through. If you think that a few lines isn't enough to give a concise review of this series, then you clearly need to talk to your programmers. Still not enough? Holy crap this site sucks majorly, maybe you should reconsider how long a review needs to be before arbitrarily blocking anyone that spends a few minutes writing a review.",10
North America,"Alright, I gave this a 7, but I truly loved the show and hope that there will be more to come. Let's start with the negative: - One of the things I disliked from this show - and from a great many other shows - is, what seems to me, the use of useless scenes, or ''fillers''. The teenage ''romance'' between Nancy and Steve is entirely unnecessary, and just slows down the pace of the show for no reason - except for wasting airtime. As such, it falls short of other tightly-written or directed TV series such as London Spy, The Night Manager, Humans, and The Man in the High Castle - to name a few. Every scene and word in these shows are clues and propel the program forward. There is not a single word wasted. - Another thing that annoyed me was the cartoon-ish acting of some of the characters: the two policemen, the librarian, and other minor characters. While this may be funny in comic books, in my experience, real-life people don't act or talk that way. - And my last negative point, which some here have pointed out, is the constant annoying whining from Joyce (Winona Ryder). It almost makes us not feel sorry for her plight. Now, on to more positive things!: - The acting of 11 is almost beyond belief. It was almost like a fully grown adult had inhabited a child's body. When I went (had to) go dig up some info on her and found out that her parents were Brits, I wasn't surprised. Great acting and presence is somehow in their DNA! - While I loved the music, I found that both the electronic and the pop stuff were out of place for this show. The electronic score would have better suited Tron or something slicker. I also doubt that Echo & the Bunnymen were the hit of the year in small town America. Then again, Jonathan was an ''different'' - so who knows. I'm really looking forward to how they will continue this. Or maybe, they can do like the Brits, and just end it on a high note, and make something entirely different.",7
North America,"This is my first review and I'd like to write since many people didn't make the obvious connection: Stranger Things ""borrows"" so many things from Resident Evil 0 and Silent Hill movie that it's borderline theft.The ""bad man"" is James Marcus from Resident Evil 0. He is a white haired, tailored suit man that every government has.Parallel dimension is nothing new but the way they treat it is directly borrowed from Silent Hill 4.The creature? It is the most obvious one: It is the Leech from Resident Evil 0. The Leech! Please make a Google Image Search and tell me they are different. I immediately got cold feet after seeing it because it's borderline theft.Best thing about Stranger Things is Winona Ryder. And her part has been ""borrowed"" too, from Silent Hill movie. Child got lost in a different dimension, she goes a bit out of her mental health but she has been always right and at the end she ""rescues"" her child. It is so... Let me put it this way: If Winona Ryder didn't act extraordinarily great, this show would be irredeemable.I'd also like to point out that Stranger Things had no impact on me. Not on horror-wise or plot- wise... I watched it and said ""meh"". As a ""meh"", it gets a 4/10 from me.",4
North America,"The first thing i need to say is ,as a kid i watched a lot of VHS recorded movies and the sense of adventure was always big when i watched The Goonies , Indiana Jones ,etc....I like the old school vibe of this show and i really like to remember the old days when kids used their imagination to play in the street , not their mind-numbness as we see today :\I loved the 1st season and the transition for the 2nd was really well accomplished so lets hope it will be as great as this one.Please watch this show and give it a 10* , this must stay at the top as one of the greatest Netflix productions .",10
North America,"OK, usually I don't bother with reviews from the first seasons. I am that ""holding back"" guy who doesn't like to rush into believe in something. But THIS, guys, was EXTRAURDINARY! The period, perfect! The casting, good. The kids were diamonds! No more than 15 y.o. and already better than most B rating actors. But the most amazing, was the story. Aaaa smells fresh, just out of the oven! Sure the concept is known, sure some characters we have seen them before. But it's not about that. The way they put them together along with the new elements... This writer should be proud of this work! And I am lucky I got to see it. Be prepared to stay on the edge of your couch, sink into thinking, get sad and happy. Be ready to enjoy a truly good series.",10
North America,"Don't misunderstand me. This TV series is by no means bad. But it is definitely not worth more than 6 stars. By all means, it has its merits. There is good acting, good special effects, and the children are not at all annoying. But what really ground my gears was the uneven pacing. There are entire episodes when nothing noteworthy happens and the plot does not progress at all. I mean this TV series has only eight episodes to begin with but it still was a huge effort to watch it all because of all the tedious bits. Additionally, the plot is extremely predictable. There were a few twists and revelations on the way but they were never surprising and you could actually see them from a mile away. At first I was intrigued by all the mystery around eleven at the beginning of the show, but her background and her connection to the other dimension became clear rather quickly. Some people might like it because of all the throw- backs to the 80s, but not being a child from this era, I did not feel nostalgic about that, but others might enjoy the show due to exactly these references. Furthermore, the story had the potential to be really scary but apart from the odd jump-scare you will not get frightened at all. So, in my opinion, it was really quite boring and I will not watch the second season.",6
North America,"I hope this is renewed.Lots of great writing and premises. But a little over acted and dramatic. Too much yelling. The adults could act little more like mature adults.Love the strong women characters. But am troubled by what happens to a stereotypical fat girl. Why do blacks always die and get crucified all the time? Why are fat people vilified? Very X-Files, Spielberg and Stephen King in flavor. Needs a few more creative twists instead of leaning on what has been done before. Duffer Bros. make your mark in a new way.",8
North America,"This was an enormously enjoyable production and has something for everyone. The acting was superb, especially from the children. My only complaint is the size of the plot holes. Having introduced an interesting idea from mainstream science the writers seemed to forget the need for consistency with the idea in the narrative. Most of these loose ends and inconsistencies showed up in the final chapter. For pedants such as myself, the resulting plot holes took something of the shine off this otherwise excellent series. Finally, it is pleasing that we have a series here that has an actual end in sight, although the producers seemed to have left a chink open for a second series.",8
North America,"I'm sure by now everyone knows about this show, so instead of writing the same stuff you've probably read already, I just want to focus on three things: 1. Yes, they did manage to give it an awesome '80s vibe, from the opening sequence to the end credits. Having grown up with these movies myself, I can attest to that. However, I think it will appeal to younger audiences as well. After all, there must be reasons that movies such as ""The Goonies"" and ""E.T."" remain memorable even now, other than the ""'80s vibe"". 2. The creators of the show (the Duffer brothers) have somewhat regretted having Winona Ryder's character acting so hysterically from the start. I disagree with that. That's EXACTLY how a real person would act if *spoiler* happened to her. I hate it when in most movies e.g. the hero loses someone very close to them, then they cry for a brief moment and then it's back to the action. That's ridiculous. 3. I liked how they gradually revealed pieces of the puzzle in every episode. No matter how clever your plot twist/secret is, if the building up period exceeds a certain point, then you'll have created too high expectations and it will be impossible to impress your viewers after that. I'm afraid that this will be a one off deal. I'm sure that the incredible success of the first season will lead to a second one, but given the plot and the ending, I doubt they'll be able to keep it to as high a level. In my honest opinion, the best case scenario would be if they wrote a similar story with a similar setting and maybe even have the same actors play different roles. I really, really wish they'll prove me wrong, but I'm afraid that a direct sequel is doomed to fail. Especially since this was supposed to be a one season show and they only discuss about making a second one because of all its unexpected success.",9
North America,"There's just one thing that really impressed me about this series and that is the high IMDb rating given to this heap of garbage.I say this because I find it utterly amazing that the reviewers who rated this steaming pile of excrement with 9's and 10's must surely ALL be under 12 years of age, and yet they have somehow managed to write reviews that, for the most part, are well worded, grammatically correct and with very few spelling errors. So - well done, kids!!For anyone over 12 years of age - please, just stay right away from this stinker.(PS: Would it have hurt to have given poor ""11"" a Kleenex tissue or two?)",1
North America,"What made me curious about stranger things is not about the hype. I've only read this once or twice somewhere from browsing the internet but the appeal it has on my geek senses really told me to watch this. Truly a hidden masterpiece over hundreds of TV series nowadays. It has this nostalgic feeling when you're a 90's or 80's kid and if you're also a fan of reading books, you could just almost imagine how the book will be like. The kid inside everyone may be related to any character in the series and the cinematography is just amazing. When you are alone at night, where everything is quiet and you feel like you wanna go for a time travel or immerse in a new world... Stranger Things delivers that feeling. Good job Duffer Brothers! Please don't screw up those upcoming seasons.",10
North America,"i don't get it what do people see in this show? actors overacted, everybody wants to be the main character while the villain who should have been at the center of the story was at the edge of it. and whats the deal with the intro and the 80's thing? if you are really into old and stuff go watch the 80's movie but not star wars, or better live in a village or somewhere, people are really tasteless in music! you think it was original? let me correct you right there, there was nothing original. you don't believe me right? go watch ""Akira"" it is an Japanese animated movie released in 1988 you'll see how much original El is watch ""insidious"", ""E.T"" it's like the evil version of it and there are may more. netflix wasted 8 hours of my life. go watch these movies and watch the series again then you'll see how much original the series is!! after doing this do message me if you think i'm wrong",5
North America,"Disappointing. Weak plot and no emphasis on details.Although the main poster gives a precise hint on the spirit of the series, I did not expect that it would be just a mixture of references to classical horror or Sci-Fi movies and the series would not have its unique features.Four kids and their journey, strongly resembled the movie ""Stand by Me"", but unlike their counterparts from 1986 classic, kids in this series did not create meaningful characters, huge nod to their acting talents though. The plot was too stereotypical and one could easily guess what would happen next. For example, finding Will Byers with animal's tentacle in his mouth rang ""Alien"" bells too loudly, while showing Yoda toy to Eleven automatically meant that she could do the same as the Jedi master. By the way, why was she called ""Eleven"" when apparently she was the first of her kind?! Just to be able to shorten her name till ""Ives""? Not funny.In addition, there were inconsistencies in the plot and details were treated careless. For example, Eleven did not even know the meaning of the word ""friend"" but she knew what kissing in the lips meant and how automatic sliding doors work. Also Will's mother was not happy at first that his son wanted to see ""Poltergeist"", but ""The Thing"" poster revealed that the kids have already watched scarier movies in the past. Besides, lighting up Christmas tree light bulbs one by one? ""That is not how the Force works!"" And the last but not least — who will cut his/her hand before fighting a monster?! No rational person, nobody!Talking about the monster, the Demogorgon, SFXs were cheap like the way used to kill the monster. ""Deus ex Machina"" moment and the sacrifice of the main character is not the final of the season deserves. Although it was a good reference to the final of ""The Matrix Revolutions"", anyway it was reference to the bad ending taking into account that Hopper and waffle scene hinted Eleven is still alive.In short, screenplay for the first season was too weak but there is still hope.",5
North America,"Love this show. The acting, character development, setting, characters, tone, and writing are fantastic. The dynamics between the characters are sweet and interesting. I'm glad to finally have an intense and clean show to watch. The music and sound add to the mystique and horror. I really hope they do more seasons. My husband even loved it and misses watching it, which says a lot because not many shows hold his interest. He can usually figure out shows too soon or find all of the holes in the plot, but he was very impressed with this series. Again, I really hope they continue this series on Netflix and maybe make some more quality shows like this one. Love the 80's nostalgia.",10
North America,"What an amazing new series! I was getting tired of hearing about all these supposedly amazing TV shows, such as Game of Thrones, The Walking Dead and Breaking Bad that people always talk about, so when I heard there was a new entry to that list I said screw it, and jumped in, and boy was it great.At the beginning the show follows 5 different perspectives of the story, Mike and the gang, Joyce, Hopper, Nancy, and Jonathan. Even though there were a lot of characters I didn't struggle to remember any names, as I usually do. This isn't because they said their names a lot, but more because all of the characters felt like real people, they were believable.Later on the 5 perspectives change into 3, Mike and the gang, Nancy and Jonathan, and Hopper and Joyce. Each team are uncovering one piece of the puzzle, making it extremely satisfying when everyone teams up in the end, so that every character knows everything.Every writer nailed it, and every actor/actress did an extremely good job, so it is difficult to find flaws here, and I tried to ignore them, but the same one kept showing up.The biggest ""problem"" is that the CGI (special effects) -team was either too small for the job or didn't have a big enough budget to keep the quality consistent. I'll try keeping this spoiler free, but there is one scene with a knife and a big jump, where the special effects are just not believable and it really pulls you out of the experience. Hopefully you know what scene I'm talking about if you've seen the show.Now that I come to think of it this next part reminds me a lot of the situation the director of Jaws had when they were filming, which was that the shark didn't look very good, so they had to keep it off- screen for most of the film to not ruin it. It is very much the same with Stranger Things, because in fight scenes with the monster in the last episode the lights keep blinking a lot, not only did this save the CGI team a lot of work, but it also saved the viewers the feeling of this not being real. But there is nothing wrong with that, because they solved the problem, well the thing is that they sort of took it back, since in one of the last scenes with Eleven the monster simply doesn't look realistic enough.I would still be willing to give it a 10/10 if that was it, because everything else is just so well done, but the final small detail that made me go to a 9 was that the last episode had me thinking the episode was ending like 5 times. The final 4-6 scenes were directed in such a way that it always looked like the credits were about to come up, making me actually want the episode to end instead of the opposite.All in all, watch this show. I can actually guarantee you that you'll like it, if it was possible to give a 9.7 I would do that.Watch it.",8
North America,"This show could have been terrific except it does exactly what we all laugh about bad horror movies. It has characters that do the stupidest things just so the story can continue. Two examples: The Sheriff decides to break into the CIA/NSA Dep't of Energy facility alone, with no idea where he's going or who he may come up against. AND, of course he finds nothing of value but does allow the CIA to bug his trailer. Then Karen Wheeler, in the woods at night with Jonathan, decides to climb through a wall of goo ALONE, to go inside a mysterious tree. She doesn't first call Jonathan to show him what she found,and maybe go in together or tell someone, like the Sheriff. No, instead she climbs through this goo into a tree trunk ALL BY HERSELF. And she's supposed to be one of the smartest students at school. Give me a break!!! It's garbage like this that ruins a show.",3
North America,"Yes it is full of 80's nostalgia, but that is not necessarily a bad thing at all. The cinematography is just amazing, the kids' performances are fantastic, the story is... well, the story is just OK. Considering that i'm writing this review with only first season aired, i believe some of the major flaws will be properly fixed for the next seasons. The show has a great potential, but DO NOT expect an ""10"" show, nor ever an ""9.1"". My eight is far generous, could be an 7.5 with honors. I recommend watching the first couple episodes, and if you're not hooked, don't waste any more time. It's a show for people who like an specific kind of sci-fi and are not too exigent.",8
North America,"I watched one review of this series which said something to the effect that they were trying to get the ""feel"" of a 1980s Spielberg/King/Carpenter movie. IF that's what they were trying to do, they succeeded. However, I can't help but feel I've lost 8 hours of my life that I'll never get back. Poorly written. Found myself being bored more often than not. Matthew Modine... What for? Winona Ryder... What for? Their lackluster performances could've been brought to life by unknowns so much better. There are things that happen in this series that normal, rational people just wouldn't do which just kills it for me. Case in point. Nancy is out in the woods with Jonathan and decides to go into the tree through to the other dimension without waiting for Jonathan... WRONG! The acting is poor throughout the series and the overacting by Ms. Ryder. If a book dragged on this long? They've taken 8 episodes to drag out what should've been covered in 4. Enough said.",5
North America,"If i could give 20 stars I would. So many characters deserve awards especially Eleven - Millie Bobby Brown. Every time I thought I knew what was going to happen, the story would take a different turn. It falls into the awesome category between Horror and Drama. I heard reviews before I watched but nothing could prepare me for what I just witness. We watched the entire season in less then 24 hours. It reminded me of a great book that you just can't put down. If you are second guessing yourself about watching it. DON'T you will not be disappointed. I have to admit we are about bunch of horror junkies and that's how we began to watch. But I can't even put it in that category alone. Its been a long time since a series has actually caught me and pulled me in. I felt like I was there with every character, every step of the way. We can't wait for season 2. The ending definitely surprised us all. KEEP UP the great work.",10
North America,"I'm an AMC- Walking Dead fan. Which I feel is one of the most innovated ""zombie"" / apocalyptic concepts ever!However, after a binge viewing of ""Stranger Things"", I would now watch stranger things over the Walking Dead.I love the 80's setting, attire, and couple of those ""Star Wars"" references. Its also reminiscences of the old Steven King series"" Amazing Stories"".This series is captivating. But you must know if you it has great cliff hangers and once you start you'll stay up all night with watching the ""next"" episode.",10
North America,"This TV series is just brilliant. It contains bits from the insanity watched in Fringe, drama from Twin Peaks, the thriller from X-files and craziness from Goonies. The wardrobe, gadgets and environment are very consistent with the time-frame. Particularly, when regarding to the old walky talky, He-Man and Skeletor on the TV, a poster of Jaws (the first movie.Young actors are good and sometimes even better than adults. Some scenes might be considered a bit violent and classified as horror but it is pretty much soft. these rare scenes come and go fast as glimpses. Since I first watched the first episode became a fan. don't know about the season 2 but I'm waiting. Hope you watch and like it as I",9
North America,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***I watched the first season, chapter after chapter, waiting for it to get better.I kept feeling like I was watching an old movie, you know, like when you watch an old movie and giggle at the effects and styles used.Saw the lovely reviews it got and kept expecting something exciting to happen.It's very predictable and a bit boring. I ended up playing on my phone waiting for something to happen.If you're looking for some thrills and excitement, look for something else.",3
North America,"Really a 6/10 but I had to give a 1/10 but its getting overrated.The show follow the 80s so by the book, it's hard to get any message from it.Is it it good? well almost.... almost...Winona Ryder and David Harbour manage to carry the show through weaker parts. The kids are cringeworthy but believable.The show sometimes follows old plots and 80's theme so hard, it just loses focus. It's become almost a parody in some parts.The production values are good. It surprisingly didn't feel cheesy.Still it lost itself following/imitating better movies.Only watch if you YOU want too. Your not missing anything by not watching it, Its IS overrated.",1
North America,"I don't understand the hype behind this show nor the praise. I don't understand what critics find so special about it. I believe this is one of the most overrated series on IMDb and it is a shame it got renewed for a second season. It has all the clichés of horror movies, whether in the poorly developed characters' behaviour or in some scenes that felt like a horror parody. The show lacks originality and feels like a weird mix between Silent Hill, The Goonies, and E.T.Stranger things is the kind of series that keeps you watching with cliffhangers while nothing really happens. The first season ended with a good episode just to give you the impression that you have not wasted your time and in the end you had a good time.The only bright side about this show was the amazing performances by David Harbour and Gaten Matarazzo. Appreciating this show and enjoying it simply amounts to intellectual masturbation and nostalgia for the 1980s.",5
North America,"The show centres around a group of nerdy misfit twelve year-old boys. The brothers who created, wrote and directed this were twelve in 1996 and that's very telling, the nostalgia isn't for the 1980s but for mainstream family films of the 1980s as seen from a distance and not as lived.There is nothing real or authentic or original to be found here, it's a film-kit made up of references, plot lines and characters cobbled together from various Spielberg films as written and filmed by inexperienced film-makers - everything is obvious, on-the-nose, and lacking in depth.",
North America,"I started watching this show expecting not to like it, simply because everyone around me had been hyping it so much, I felt I could only be disappointed. It didn't only NOT disappoint, but I got exactly why all those people, 80s kids like me, loved this show so much.We grew up watching E.T., Firestarter, Stand by me and Poltergeist, the last one, hiding behind the sofa for most of the film because our parents had realised it was too scary for elementary children and sent us to bed an hour ago.We all had walkie talkies that never quite worked as we expected them to, we all jumped at noises in the dark wondering what kind of monster (or benevolent alien) was lurking there and we all associated those heavy synthesizers with the ""something big's about to happen"" moment.And we are all very, very nostalgic geeks. The Duffer brothers didn't have a hard time making us happy, because they knew exactly what we wanted, and they delivered.",10
North America,"Upon hearing about the new show Stranger Things, I was at first a little skeptic. So many shows and movies have done the topic, and it was kinda just another one that would come and go with no real fan base as far as I thought. Watching episode one I was clearly mistaken. the episode was well done, the characters I immediately fell in love with, and the episode ended with a cliffhanger. I thought Walking Dead was gripping. As you join on the quest to find Will Byers, you will feel nostalgia, and a longing for that time in the 80s that a lot of viewers actually haven't lived (myself included. A fan of the 80s all the way, but born in the 90s). References to pop culture aren't overdone, the music is just amazing and makes you feel like you're in the decade, and the small details are even fine tuned to make you think for the duration of the episode you were in the 80s while watching it. The story is so good that immediately after the first season, I and my friends began to talk about what could be happening next, the wait for season two will be long and arduous, but totally worth it for this gripping show.",10
North America,"This show is amazing.Just finished watching it about an hour ago. This is amazing. seriously. It's a thriller and a horror show, but also funny, brings happiness, and DEM FEELS!!! Seriously, if you have doubt, give this a try! I thought it's pretty overrated because everyone was talking about this. And I gave it a try, and its amazing! I love the tone, the writing is SPECTACULAR!This show is an amazing early 80s throwback, the screenplay and actors do an amazing job of conveying a sense of the time with references and feel in the show. and the performance!I usually don't expect much from kid actors but all of the child actors here were amazing. Seriously, go watch it",9
North America,"So I am going to sound extremely knowledgeable here so that my review seems interesting AND I reach the minimum amount of words needed to post my review :POK, that's the best I could do. meh!Well, not that big a fan of show's seeming to outdated, started off with minimum expectations, and bammmmm, there I was, totally sucked into it.The way they have given screen time to every character and allowed them to grow on their own, its amazing. You can't pick up a clear ""lead"" like in other shows, which is good.There are enough laughs and tears along the way, you get attached with the characters, I loved the kids, specially Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) and Eleven (Millie Brown) and Mike (Finn wolfhard) AND the rest of them for that matter.The story line is also very good, they don't waste your time like other show's who assume that they are going to go on forever and increase the episodes uselessly and irritatingly. And best part is that it doesn't leave you unsatisfied in the end, they give you a sort of closure, to please you and YET keep enough unanswered questions, so that you want more but can happily wait.This is how a TV Show should be made, sensible closure's for every seasons, and at the max 8/10 episodes per season.WATCH IT!",9
North America,"Stranger Things is an eight-episode Netflix original series created by the Duffer Brothers. Upon its release, it gained phrase from audiences and critics alike. After having been recommended this series by multiple people, I began to watch it fairly recently. I cannot say it hooked me - otherwise I would have finished it days earlier - but it was entertaining enough to watch all the way through. A lot worked in terms of characters and their development, but there were two particular things that didn't work; which I will talk about later in this review.In terms of positives, there is enough to phrase here. The characters and strong and effectively carry the show - the group of kids, who are the most central characters, are all particularly entertaining and witty - even if some of their performances aren't great. Winona Ryder's acting is by far the best, and David Harbour also gives a good performance (and a great character) as the police chief. The teenage characters aren't quite as strong, and the typical love triangle sub-plot bores, but none of them are bad. The character development throughout the series is great, making all the characters more and more likable as the series goes on. On the whole, the casting is excellent - everyone fits their part very well.Thankfully, it is consistent in its quality. None of the episodes are bad; although none of them are fantastic either. For me, each episode scores a 7 or an 8. The consistency keeps it from getting boring, which made it a series which I wanted to watch to the end. The other positives include a great soundtrack which works very well with the show's themes and scenes; a fun, if very retro title sequence; and generally good dialogue throughout.However, as mentioned above, there are two places in which this series falls down. The first of which is the lack of originality and clichés. This series is ultimately a homage of 80's sci-fi - there are scenes that reference, and steal from movies such as E.T., Aliens, The Thing, The Goonies and many more. At first the nostalgic references may work - but as the show goes on you release that it is not just referencing these movies, but blatantly stealing from them. Not one thing in this entire series is particularly original - everything becomes ridiculously clichéd and thus predictable. Unless this is the first movie or TV show you have ever seen, you will probably find the predictability and clichéness of this series very annoying (as I did).The other main issue is that almost all the twists are revealed far too early. There are too few surprises. We learn most things before the characters do and then have to watch as they finally catch up with the audience, which sometimes takes multiple episodes. So when a big shock comes around for the characters, there is absolutely no shock for the audience; which ultimately makes a lot of the series much less effective.But despite this, there are enough human dramas, engaging characters and sci-fi elements to make this an enjoyable eight episodes. In the end I would recommend this to a friend, even though this series falls short of the heights of the films it aspires to be.",7
North America,"This show brings the audience to the 80's realm and as a 90's kid, this totally blew me off. The old school American ambiance is so ethereally relaxing. It's like watching The Bridges of Madison County minus the adult romance. The radio, the country slash town life, the costume, everything was perfect. If you're into this kind of classic stuff, I'm sure you'll be definitely loving this series!The characters'acting and emotions deserve everyone's respect and praise. I couldn't find any character more fitting to their designated roles (except Nancy and Jonathan perhaps *forgive my bias but they could hell do a lot better on the next season*). Millie Bobby Brown (El), Winona Ryder (Joyce) and Gaten Matarazzo (Dustin) are my favorites. El's iconic stare, smile and speech really caught my heart and got me utterly flabbergasted. Joyce's weary and frantic beautiful eyes did its job damn so well. This show really showcased each and everyone's experience and potential in acting. Almost all characters got the ""charm"" the audience unconsciously desire so bad. One best example is Dustin's character, who's supposedly the real science nerd and mediator of the group. This boy's got the bomb for real. What I'm looking for the next season is perhaps they could highlight Lucas' and Mike's character to redeem themselves from their role (though I can honestly say they did their job pretty well).Story-wise, the pacing was medium-fast. Few to almost zero loopholes. This show for me doesn't belong to horror genre but more on the family/mystery/adventure corner which I think could be watchable to kids 10 and up. The eerie art, grimly colorful lights, and the classic 80's music complemented each sequence harmoniously. All I could ever say is that this show has got it all! The thrill, hype, romance, camaraderie vibe, subtle contempt, everything is here folks! Just watch and you'll never regret a minute of your life! I can't wait for the next season!!!",10
North America,"I finished Stranger Things and although I thought it was alright, I can't say there's any chance I would've finished if everybody else wasn't raving about it. I have issues with it that I will now explain. SPOILERSI found the acting to be unimpressive. The children were great for TV child actors, but whenever their scenes came up I was unconvinced and disengaged. I also found most of the characters to be annoying to watch. They continually made assumptions that were silly with the information they had at the time. There are times where characters come to a far-fetched conclusion that is coincidentally correct, but if it weren't the truth these conclusions would make the characters seem dumb and crazy based on the information. Another thing about the characters is the sudden emotional shifts they would make towards one another that seemed so artificial and often out of character. It would be difficult to explain without going through an episode beat by beat, but it's all about the time, reason, and development.Throughout the series, with the exclusion of the sheriff, characters are constantly fumbling through the dangerous situations without any prior knowledge and preparation for them. Yet all of the main characters, except for Eleven who was obviously going to die from the very beginning, never die or take any serious injuries. When characters fumble around and just keep escaping with no effort or plan, slowly all the tension is lost for me. The reason I say with exception to Hopper, is because in his scenes he is the only character who seems at all capable and plans like his situations are actually dangerous.Let's talk about the homage aspect, because that's what it is, not a parody or satire. The clichés and awful, stupid parts of the series were often used knowing that they were clichés, but the series never did anything to show any SELF-AWARENESS. These clichés were placed with the knowledge that they are 80s tropes, but the series didn't show it understood what makes these tropes stupid! It just used them, never satirizing, exaggerating, or critiquing. When the villain of the series is overly evil and underdeveloped, when the dog somehow has the ability to sense the supernatural, it's not making fun of it. If someone can give me some reason as to how the series did show self-awareness, that would be appreciated.Let's address the monster in the room, that monster. It's rules are poorly defined, and the one characteristic they do give it doesn't make sense. It clearly only needs a small amount of blood going by how much Barbara bled before she was taken. So in the weeks in between when the monster first appears to get Will Byer and the end where El turns it into pixie dust, only six people in the entire area had any bleeding?! It's also interesting how Steve had blood on his face after his fight, but the monster never showed up then. I guess we never heard about that one HOSPITAL that got raided by the monster. And I guess all the women in the town never had any periods.The CG is bad. Don't tell me that it is an intentional, artistic decision, you know what the 80s were good for? Does it know what all those movies it kept referencing are known for, practical effects! I burst out laughing when the monster got burned by the CG fire.The ending isn't well-contained or wrapped up with so many loose ends left dangling for the sake of a happy ending from which to jump into a second season. However, the show does show self-awareness about this, when the kids are playing DND at the end they complain about how the campaign ended suddenly on a happy note with loose ends left unfinished. Take that for what you will.As someone who isn't that into 80s electronic music, I thought the soundtrack ranged from really good to OK depending on the song and how it was used. It was well shot and lit for a TV show, but I can't say I was ever impressed just having come out of Midnight Special that is similar in concept, tone, and aesthetic with far more impressive film making.If I wanted to go through the series episode by episode, I could keep going on and on. Just my thoughts on the series, with everyone raving about how fantastic it is I felt like I needed to defend my feelings on it. I'm glad everybody else loves it, but I would be lying if I said I would give it higher than a 6/10.",6
North America,"I'm not gonna say much about this. Stranger Things has a 9.1 on IMDb, so that means it's one of the best shows ever, but I don't see why the ratings are so high. Episode 1 was good (7/10), episode 2 was good (7/10), and episode three was good as well (7/10), but I have no idea how they get 8.7, 8.6, and 9.1/10 ratings on here. For other TV shows, for an episode to get more than a 9/10 it has to be something spectacular. Here, it seems like anything remotely good can get an 8.5 or a 9/10 just because it is in Stranger Things. I think the ratings for this are only so high because people are so nostalgic about the 80's and are more influenced by their nostalgia than by actual quality of the episodes.Overall, Stranger Things is a good show and very well produced, but it's not the masterpiece that people say it is.",1
North America,"I'm not gonna write a long review because I don't want to repeat what many others have said. Stranger Things is a good show- it's very well directed and acted, it has a pretty interesting mystery, and some of the first episodes are pretty creepy- but it is nowhere near the level of quality many people say it is. I liked the amount of suspense and horror in the first few episodes, but as the show went on it became more about the uninspired characters and less about the mystery, sci fi and horror, and when we finally saw the Demagorgen it looked really cheap. I've watched all of the episodes, and the only episodes that impressed me were the second one, which had a great first half but dropped the ball a bit in the last 30 minutes, and Holly Jolly. I think (like some people have already said), the super-high rating this show has on IMDb might just be because so many people are nostalgic about the 80's and not because Stranger Things is actually one of the best shows ever. Stranger Things isn't a bad show, but it's nowhere near as good as people say it is.",7
North America,"Stranger Things is starting to look like the best and most gripping series since Breaking Bad. The story itself is farcical in places but this suits the style of the piece, which is both based on and stooped in fantasy and science fiction. If you are expecting pure realism or even a completely sensible plot, look elsewhere, otherwise prepare for a journey to the twisted and dark sides of the imaginations of child and adult alike.The best thing about the story is that it is so multifaceted - it is a kid's story, a fairy tale; a coming of age story; a story about adulthood, of loss, grief and responsibility. What brings this all together is the fantastic performances of the cast all round. All the child actors are brilliant and bring something unique to the table, but particular note has to be given to Finn Wolfhard and Millie Brown who's relationship and exceptional performances form the backbone of the series. Charlie Heaton is standout as a young man who's had to fill the shoes of an absent father, and really is the hidden gem of this show. Both Winona Ryder and David Harbour are excellent too, with both giving stunning and at times heart-wrenching performances throughout. Though, that being said, most of the credit must go to the kids who absolutely carry the show.The cinematography is simple, humble but beautiful. The design and appearance of the various settings are spot on, particularly the 'upside-down', which is the stuff of nightmares. The music is perfect, unique and really ties everything together whilst being the key to the suspense this show does so well. You can tell there are some clever minds behind the scenes, but as is often the case with such skillful acting overall, the show seems completely natural and there is little conscious sense that it's been so carefully written, plotted and directed.I absolutely cannot fault this show and consider it a must watch. Yes, you will have to suspend your disbelief at times, but that is the nature of a genre which plays so enjoyably with scientific fantasies.",10
North America,"So I'm going to make this as quick and as fair as I can. Whilst the show is actually good, and it was hard for my girlfriend and I to not watch it in one sitting. There were still some huge problems with the show and I'll just go over the 5 main ones:1. The show copied a lot of things from movies like 'Alien', 'E.T', 'Pulse', 'Carrie' and a dozen other movies. Watching Stranger Things is like watching a mix of many of the unique things that made other movies good (or bad). With some things it's really cool, but in others you get the feeling that the writers were really damn unoriginal.2. Some of the characters completely suck. The worst being 'Winona Ryder'. This b.... cries for tens of minutes every single episode. When she isn't crying, she's screaming about how she isn't crazy. We get that she's suffering like mad but they took her dramatic behaviour way, way too far. Honestly it gets to the point where it started to give us a physical headache and had us both shouting ""We get it already!"". The constant yelling (and fighting) from the kids also got a bit much too.3. There are BIG plot holes and I had some issues with some of the outcomes. Why did the 'Bad men' let Hopper live (but kill the cook at the start) and why did they just sit back and observe everyone instead of being more active about containing the situation? Why was Barb just completely forgotten? I mean we only see her mum make one concerned call about her… Also did you really have to steal the ending again, from Alien?4. A lot of the themes are ridiculous. Examples are when the kids are being actively chased by the 'bad men', 'El' just flips a car and they all decide to just stop chasing them. It's not like they couldn't have continued on after them. In general the 'bad men' are very well… bad, at tracking down a single girl who continuously leaves a path of destruction and chaos in her wake. Mike's father is also overly useless, and again Barb's mother… In fact all of the parents just seem to be really messed up in Hawkins.5. There's way too much feminism bullcrap going on in the movie. Insert the overweight, ginger lesbian, the androgynous looking female child lead with the shaved head with insane PTSD issues who is 'triggered' by everything. Oh, I almost forgot the token 'black kid' and the kid with a lisp. So that's: 1 'overweight ginger lesbian (wow killing 3 birds with 1 stone), 1 'person of colour', 1 'androgynous female with extreme PTSD' and 1 person with a birth defect. You could also throw Johnathan's extreme social awkwardness in there too and maybe the science teacher's Asian girlfriend.Putting all this aside the movie is definitely still interesting enough that it was hard for us to stop watching to go to sleep for the night. There's enough content for you to make some presumptions but not enough that you still end up getting a lot of things wrong. Though, at times the pacing is really slow and there's a lot of unnecessary stuff thrown in.Unfortunately, the biggest problem with the show is just the amount of hateable, badly developed or totally useless characters, and the undeniable incompetence of the 'bad men' and also Mike's parents are just so useless (really the father WTF). A lot of characters just feel like cannon fodder and give absolutely nothing to the setting or plot.I'll give it a 'B minus'. It's worth watching, but unless you're a potato, you will have your gripes with it when you're done.",6
North America,"OK. I have decided that Stranger Things is kind of a kiddie ""Lost-wannabe"". I don't care what kind of ratings this show is pulling, it's really not that good. I'm trying, but i'm pretty sure it's going to fizzle out for me. I need more substance less blah blah blah. Right now it's hitting at a 4 for me. Whynona needs to take some meds. She's just not making it as a convincing character. My absolute favorite character is the chief of police. I do like him. The rest are just not very likable. And come on, the nose-bleeder really should've grasped some of the English language as she was talked to fairly normally even though she was in a very weird situation. Overall, the acting is mediocre to real bad and the storyline is mediocre to borrrring. I'm on episode six.....give me something.....I need something to keep me interested or yawn......zzzzzzzzzzzzzz.",4
North America,"Absolutely in love with this show. Halfway through it just felt like a childhood favorite, one I could just ease into watching and feel so, so comfortable. You can definitely feel its Spielberg influence, and yet it manages to stand out among all other TV shows right now. It's a great blend of coming-of-age childhood drama, comedy, horror, and fantasy. I don't think it's always perfect, but it has such simple, great characters. Out of all of the Netflix shows I've seen as well, it's perhaps the one with the biggest heart. Such a joy to watch, I did not want to keep progressing though the season because I did not want it to end.",10
North America,"When the trailer first came out, it didn't do much for me. It appeared to be just another generic thriller. However, I gave it a go one late night when I couldn't go to sleep and was immediately drawn in after the amazing title sequence. Not only does it set the tone for this 80's-inspired series by using the famous Stephen King book title font, but the theme track combined with the hypnotic movements of the letters falling into place is a pure joy to watch.""Stranger Things"" manages to give just enough answers to all our questions while at the same time giving us reason to want more. Unlike a lot of other shows these day, it is simple but effective at telling its story lines. There are a lot of nostalgia and references to the 80's childhood for the target audience to dwell in. Although the child actors aren't that great, their performances are innocent and heartfelt. Millie Bobby Brown however gives an amazing performance and I am sure we will see much more of her acting in the future.The episode run time of 40 minutes is ideal. These days it's hard to find anything else than comedy with a laughing track that keeps it so short. Unfortunately the show is over really fast too, but nothing good ever lasts, does it.",8
North America,"Story was good not great but good,story telling and atmosphere was good, acting was generally good specially child actors acting was excellent. Surprisingly no hot chicks in an American Serries (lol). Only one thing was flawed and it was Winona Ryder. Such a terrible acting. If you pick random scenes of Winona's and what it without knowing the story line, you can not tell if she is afraid, surprised, worried or etc. etc. She was so fake every time she enters the scene and start talking i started to get bored. it is 9/10 without Winona Ryder but i must give -1 for Winona Ryder's terrible acting so 8 out of 10.Anyone would be perfect replacement for the Winona Ryder's part. Even Sandra Bullock could be better choice (lol) Of course she is as boring as Winona Ryder but at least she is not that fake.",8
North America,"Not only because I come from Durham, Stranger Things gets my vote for best and most creative new development in film and video in many years. The brothers Duffy have woven a masterful story over 8 one-hour episodes, and maintained both quality and attention throughout. My only beefs are the (nowadays usual) use of near-whisper or unintelligible sounds in the dialogue, and an over-use of Shalyman-like darkness in too much of the critical ""other-world"" scenes (and in some of the regular-world ones, such as the swimming-pool sequence). The use of blinking overall-lighting and flashing light-darkness is also overdone, and distracts from several critical scenes. For film-makers this early in their game, these shortcomings are distracting but slight compared with their success in the storyline and general excellence in production. Hoping to be around long enough to see their talents develop fully.",10
North America,"This show is essentially pandering to the masses who want something mindless and nostalgic that wraps up in a predictable, anti-climactic bow. Stranger Things does not deserve to share the same ratings with a masterpiece like True Detective. The acting is annoyingly terrible. The plot is predictable and disappointing. But if you're looking for a a feel-good, nostalgic 80s vibe - yet want to also feel like you're watching something edgy and creepy (which this isn't) then go for it.There was a point in one of the episodes where Nancy and Jonathan are shooting bottles and I said ""He's going to miss, then she's going to hit the bottle on her first shot, turn and give him a coy smile, and then its going to immediately cut to the next scene."" And that was literally shot for shot what happened. Is this a testament to me being psychic, or that this show is utterly predictable?The only thing that kept me watching until the very end was a hope that there would be some sort of interesting, clever turn - some sort of intelligent explanation for the events that beg all of the questions. But nope. The explanation that they give is so dull that my eyes nearly rolled out of my head. The whole concept of the sheet of paper, and the ""upside down."" Look, I love fantasy. And I'm all about accepting when there are things you aren't meant to know, but this was just annoying.And don't get me started on the child actors. They can't conduct a scene without escalating to full blown yelling within 20 seconds and frankly - its annoying as hell. Of course you can't expect Oscar winning performances from children, but the Directors here could have provided at least the simple direction to not be yelling 99% of the time.I literally made an account on IMDb just to make this review. I feel like I'm the only person out there who sees this show for being the total crap that it is.",4
North America,E.T meets Goonies and Resident Evil with Nostalgic Tron overtone.Horror combined with Telepathy - it's all going on.Short and simple - some series can over-do it with episodes but this was kept nice and simple.Not for kids -unless you want them to have nightmaresAction starts from beginning so it's not a slow burner.Hope you guys enjoy it. Lights turned off and volume turned up ;)Winona Ryder and the little girls acting is brilliant.I have to write an extra line in order to have this review posted but wanted to keep it short and simple.,8
North America,"I read here and there some comments about this show and how great it is. This and ratings on IMDb mean nothing. Nowadays TV shows became so bad that even the biggest crap is glorified.The moment i started watching the show, seeing four boys are playing dungons and dragons, that gave me a smile and remembered me about my own childhood. But i was highly suspicious because of the black boy.I thought the moment they will glorify this black kid as especially brave, super talented or smarter then everyone else i will switch this thing off and forget about it. Because i am just sick of the political correctness bull where they always add some under laying social education to every show. The same i thought about overly heroic girls or any social justice non sens which may appear.But it never happened. The black kid was just a kid, the girl even when she had super powers was just a 12 year old girl and acted like one. Not only one social justice propaganda or even any cliché was seen in the whole series.To be honest, i binge watched it! :) It was brilliant. Just a good story, very well acted and the characters where just regular people. Enjoyable from the beginning to the end.And that's how you not suck at making a good TV show. Just stick by your story and spare us the social education.",10
North America,"I admit that When you watch the first episode, it makes want to watch them all. At the end, you wont waste your time, but you want get some masterpiece of a show that you may be searching for. The casting is very good. I also liked the whole 80s atmosphere that creators want to get. It has perfect soundtrack, something that makes the show more likable. But nevertheless, at the end of it all you get the feeling like it is ""Steven King wanna be"" movie or ""Twin Peaks for kids"" or ""Darker version of E.T"". While you watch it, it brings nostalgia for all that 80s movies. And the creators get that feeling very good. You kinda think that it was really shoot at the 80s. Not the best show on earth, but worth watching. Seven from ten from me.",7
North America,"I didn't believe the hype when this show first hit Netflix. Everyone was talking about it and I figured it was just some stupid show. I was completely wrong. I just non-stop watched the whole first season and it blew me away. It literally is as far up my alley as something can be. It's got an 80's setting complete with synthesizers and a slight film grain, thriller drama elements, super powers, monsters, an alternate reality, top notch acting, an excellent score with the appropriate 80's soundtrack and an insanely good gripping story. I enjoyed this show so much and I encourage anyone who enjoys being entertained to watch this show. After finishing it I feel weird and attached to the characters in a way that only the best movie and TV shows can do to you and I can not wait until season 2. The Duffer brothers have an enormous and well deserved success to follow up and hopefully they can pull it off.",9
North America,"This is what happens when you let the writers write a show the way it should be written. From what I know, around 20 networks told the brothers who wrote this that they should make a simple, one-dimensional series for dumb people. The brothers stuck to their vision because they wanted to make an amazing series and look what happened - they succeeded, because it turns out that viewers aren't as dumb as show producers think they are. If you know anything about storytelling, you will be blown away by what the writers have done here. The '80s details are one thing, the many references to classic and cult movies are another, but there is so much more to this. The child actors, for example, who were born already in the 21st century, are nothing like contemporary actors. They're just like Goonies, and I can't believe that they managed to act like that if they probably haven't even seen any '80s movies.Then there's the story, or rather 4 of them, perfectly blended together. How new events of each story are presented bit by bit is just brilliant. Writers of 99% of of modern TV shows have no idea about what pacing is or what makes viewers care about the characters. In 'Stranger Things' the viewer connects with the characters immediately. You watch it and cherish every moment. I never liked Winona Ryder, her acting was always stiff to me. Here, she's totally brilliant, as is everyone else. It's as if you've time-travelled and you're watching stuff happen in a small town for real. It's so realistic.Another amazing thing about this show is that there is hardly any CGI, or at least it's used in such a way that it doesn't show. Back in the '80s there was no CGI and movie-makers had to have sets built from scratch. Imagine how much work it took to make 'Terminator'. This show looks like it was mostly created by hand, except maybe the monster.Next thing: dialogues. They sound so natural and so cool, especially the kids' dialogues, but other characters also have realistic lines, it's just such a pleasure to listen to people talk in this show. It's almost music to the ears because you don't hear good dialogue these days anymore, it's always stiff, cliché-ridden, pompous, and the like. Here, you hear people talk as they usually talk. Again, it's like you ended up in the '80s for real.'Midnight special', a movie that came out recently, got good reviews from the critics, who said that it's very good despite the obvious reference to 'E.T.' Well, like many other movies, that one was pretty much a cookie-cutter movie, full of overused lines and tricks. In 'Stranger Things' you see a lot of things borrowed from other movies and '80s books but the show is still fresh and original, and it's beyond me how they managed to create the same kind of atmosphere that you would've seen in those movies from 30 years ago.I hope that in season 2 the writers will keep up the good work because it would be a shame if they didn't. This is a must-see for everyone. It will make you recall at least 20 movies from when you were a kid. I'm just wondering what it's like for those born in the late '90s and later, that is those who don't know a world without the internet and cell phones and who've never seen the kind of clothes that the characters of 'Stranger Things' are wearing, or cars, or phones. When the mother of one kid says that they can go to the movie store together, that's bound to raise a few eyebrows.The funniest thing about 'Stranger Things' is that even though we're surrounded by technology, and everyone's on Facebook and Instagram, and we're glued to our cell phones, you can watch this show and not realize that none of this stuff exists in the show's reality. You will be so immersed that it will all seem natural - the fact that kids don't play computer games in their free time or the fact that you have to develop a camera film in the dark room. If you've lived through the '80s, you will easily forget the 21st century for the duration of the show.I hope Netflix will become THE network to go to if you want to watch a great show. Perhaps the dumbing down process can slowly be reversed and other networks will follow suit when they realize there's money to be made from interesting, cleverly-written and beautifully produced series. They don't make them like they used to but who says they can't again?",9
North America,"Stranger Things is a lot of things. It's a series about monsters; a science fiction story about secret government testing; it's about a mother searching for her missing son and dealing with grief; it's the awkward teen romance; it's also a story about childhood friendship. At its heart though, this is a show about childhood and adolescence. When you are growing up, a young person's life revolves around the small world he/she creates for him/herself. One doesn't think about the hard realities or question the boundaries of what is and isn't possible. And Stranger Things really excels at taking you back and making you experience that childhood nostalgia. I often felt, that I was watching an X-Files episode, Super 8, or a Spielberg movie.Usually in family oriented TV shows revolving around adults and kids, what ends up happening is that the story is often told from the perspective of the parents'. ""We,""the audience, experience the kids through the lens of their parents, or any other adults in the story. We see the hardships and joy adults face dealing with kids. But, here, radically enough for 8 episodes, the three kids in the story Lucas, Dustin, and Mike are in charge of their own world. They are legitimate, willful agents of their own story. Their parents are at best bystanders; sometimes watching the antics with disinterest or mild frustration, and other times wholly ignorant of the adventures these kids go through.One never doubts, that Stranger Things is a story of the kids, as they unravel the mystery of their missing friend Will, and make a new friend with Eleven. The adults exist in the minds of the kids' in the murky periphery; not always as allies or confidantes, in fact the adults are only vaguely visible, coming in and out of focus.For more visit www.artspeaksy.com",9
North America,"Stranger Things, is the series that's so simple yet intelligently made that when you have to explain it in words to friends it sounds so complex!This is the show which anyone can understand! Young adults e.g. 16 upwards to people the age of 40+ can all understand and reference different things inside the show!This summer i was debating between watching either Stranger Things or Narcos and lets just say i've been able to start Narcos! I finished Stranger Things in 2 days! This show keeps you hooked constantly and leaves you becoming a character inside the show, the viewer can relate to any character in every episode!All in all this show is a masterpiece from Netflix! Let's just say AMC and other series creators have some serious standards now, Netflix keep up the good work!",10
North America,"""9/10!"" the reviews state on IMDb and other news publicity sites. I like Science Fiction and lots of people have been talking about Stranger Things on netflix. It's a show that is influenced by 80's sci- fi and action movies. Everything about this is from the 80s. It's basically for nostalgia-philes. Friends recommended me this show because I like the X Files. I checked out the first episode. It seemed to have OK action scenes. The monster, whatever it was, seemed pretty cool, but you rarely see it. Most of the show is Drama. I got really annoyed at the actors very quickly (Except for the reluctant cop Jim Hopper played by David Harbour, whom I thought was quite funny) Winona Ryder (Will's mother) really irritates me. Her over acting is unnecessary. It's filled with cheesy 80s nostalgia and Hollywood B-Grade movie Clichés. I was expecting better, but I don't think i'd stick around for this one.",3
North America,"Its The Best Fiction Show.The Story Building Is Very Slow But Very Interesting. Acting Of All Crew Is Very Good. The Way Story Goes, Pretty Classic But Very Interesting. If U Like Si-Fi And Other Fiction Show Than U Will Definitely Like It Condition To Have Some Patience As Story Is Very Slow Moving And Classic. But Direction And Story Line Is Very Strong. In Starting It Feels Like Very Slow Moving And For A Time Being It Became Boring, But As Story Goes Further There Is Element Of Surprise And Secrete That Make This Show Very Interesting. A Group Of Smart And Talented Kids And Their Unity Makes It Very Good. In Short If U Are Fiction Lover And Little Bit Patient U Should Definitely Watch It.",9
North America,"Absolutely amazed and astounded with the quality, emotion, thrill and story behind this top notch show. Set with an awesome blend of 80s X-Files/Modern Sci-Fi Thriller, this makes it to my all time favorites.Gripping and inspiring from start to finish, there is no chance this show can waste your time. Well paced, with a great cast and attachment to characters, my appreciation only got better as I watched.This is one of those shows that deserves your time. I can only think of someone being dissatisfied with this if they genuinely disliked the genre and were very picky. Cannot stress how much I recommend this, and to me and many others, it deserves all 10 of its stars.Whether you're into a bit of drama, a horror/thriller, some Sci-Fi, government conspiracy, psychic powers, a classic crime story or young love, Stranger Things packs it all into a fantastic experience you won't forget any time soon.",10
North America,"I had heard a lot of praise for this show, but I wasn't all that interested, at first. I knew it was, basically, a love letter to classic Spielberg and Stephen King, both of whom I am a very big fan, but I had seen J.J. Abrams' Super 8, and, while it was good, I felt it was a bit lacking in the magic that Spielberg and King had always perfected.Not the case with this show.One night I just decided to start it, because I was looking for a good 80s movie to watch. Very first shot, with the guy in the lab coat, running away, I was instantly engaged, wanting to know what was happening. In my opinion, the girl, named Eleven, steals the show, even from well-known actors like Winona Ryder, David Harbour, and Matthew Modine. The three main protagonists, the boys, are a close second. These four kids are just amazing and have really good acting chops.Many plot points are taken from classic 80s movies, with a lot of throwbacks to Alien, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, E.T. and countless others. There are people disappearing in a small rural town in the 80s and there are some ""strange things"" happening. The suspense, the mystery, the horror, the emotion, are all spectacular and it's all set against a perfectly realized 1980s backdrop. I can't wait for season 2!",10
North America,What can I say? Felt like I was back in 1982!!!!! Amazing!!! Superb!!!! Great acting!!!!! Excellent effects!!! Great story!!!!! Great writing!!!! Can't wait for season 2!!!!!!!! Bring it on!!!!!! Need more shows like this!!! At last no more Hollywood remakes!!!! Less drama more intrigue!!!! Please don't waste season 2:) Keep what works!!!!!Seriously this deserved the applause it's getting!Well done Netflix!!!!You really scored high!!!Keep up the same tempo!!!Don't ruin it please!!!!!,10
North America,"I wasn't sure about this series at first, but I heard such great stuff about the series from my brother, so I decided to give the series a watch. And wow I was amazed how the series keeps you glued on happens next.Set in 1983, and it feels like it was made in that decade, the filmmakers even use an 80's like soundtrack. The story is quite an awesome mystery each episode is like puzzle you slowly put together. An awesome blend of horror and sci-fi. The actors all play there parts really well, David Harbour is great has the sheriff, times he comes across like a ticking time bomb just waiting to go off. Winona Ryder is great has a mother, don't care what other people say about her performance, I thought she really delivered. And the other young actors are awesome here, they all just keep you watching. And now I'm waiting for season 2.",9
North America,"Stranger Things is nothing more than Cut - copy & paste TV series. Cast is decent ..makeups are good but direction and story are too bad.So called inspiration from various sources just feel like you are watching Steven Spielberg + John Carpenter + Stephen King's movies at the same time. which is not very pleasant experience.The story revolve around a lost child and their friends and family trying to find him.I can't go into great detail because there are so many flaws in direction and story that its not possible to explain all of them here. But they says that ""even a good cast cannot save a bad story"".Even though there are plenty of thrilling and exciting moments but they don't make much sense as don't understand the story and whats going on.Seems like directors were confused and they are trying to make viewer even more confused.Folks just do a favor please done make a season 2 of this series.Thanks Best of Luck",1
North America,"This show will be a classic, well it is for me already. it takes place in the early eighties! There is not much greatness in the Eighties but this definitely changes opinions. Like all Netflix shows, the actors were on point, they all seamed to have perfect chemistry. The show was sort of dark, eerie, but had humor here and there, all in the best kind of way. ever since watching this I've been curious to watch the x files series because that's what it reminds me of. I seriously cant wait to watch season 2, especially after watching the trailer for it, so much mystery I highly recommend this show to everyone, now find out for yourself!",9
North America,"I was full of hope when I watched the pilot for this highly rated and very popular series. After the pilot I was bewildered as to why the vast number of viewers have given this wishy-washy show such outrageously high ratings! There is nothing new being done here and the quality is mediocre, IMHO!But I decided to watch another episode, just in case the material got better. I, however, gave up towards the end of it. I found it so boring and basically just annoying. This series hardly deserves even one star; it's dreadful!I found the acting to be mostly mediocre, as well as the material. Winona Ryder is overplaying her role with too much hysteria. Other actors are just so so...",1
North America,"I'll start this with a little game myself and my friends engaged in two hours into this series: Guess the next line of dialogue?Will they say this? Yes! Funny.Will they say that? Yes. Amusing.Surely, they won't say this. Yes. Fun factor now worn thin.I cannot guess correctly five times in a row? Why, yes, sir, you can.Inspired by Steven King, Twin Peaks, or whatever other I've heard this referred to, it may have some merit but only in that the producers found a way of taking the best of those and others that went before it and reduced that artistry to the lowest common denominator, removing all originality, inspiration and insight. I thought after 2 hours I was actually watching a cartoon for 10 year olds.Now, maybe I should have given it more than 2 hours.Maybe, if I had tits, I could be my Aunt Agatha.No.Who is voting for this shallow dishwater?It's been done before, often, almost invariably better.",1
North America,"Fantastic show, I could break it down, launch into a whole series of theories, comparisons to like movies and spoilers; but I'll spare everyone. I will say I love the fact it's not just the kids, all ages get involved in the mystery.Well done to the Duffer Brothers and to Netflix for making this happen. GREAT acting, Winona who knew! The kids, Harbour, Modine, wow, awesome casting and work by the cast! If you've not seen the first season, be prepared to binge as it's hard to stop watching.Thank you Netflix and Duffers, can't wait to see what's next and I can't wait for Season 2!!!",10
North America,"I am typically very critical of TV shows and films, and recently there is very little that truly astonishes me. ""Stranger Things"" absolutely blew my mind and won my heart. However, with over 400 user reviews already posted here, there isn't much I can say that hasn't already been said. So I'll just say a few things:This series is just incredible, and it's like nothing I've ever seen before, be it a TV series or a film. It reminds me very much of the type of horror films that John Carpenter has made, and Stephen King to a lesser extent. All the same, it's very much in line with 80's & 90's sci-fi horror. The period style of the series, which is the late 1980's, was done incredibly well. If you remember--or grew up during--the years between 1985 and 1995 like I did, then you will genuinely appreciate the little things in this series, as the period-correct atmosphere & set design makes it all the more enjoyable.ALL of the actors did an amazing job, the cinematography is incredible, as are the set designs, costumes, special effects, sound; absolutely everything is positively excellent in quality and in it's delivery. I've never seen anything done this well in this genre since the early movies which inspired it. There simply isn't anything bad that I can say about this show! Since I've begun reviewing movies & shows on IMDb, I've never given anything a 10/10, and I take that ""award"" very seriously, but ""Stranger Things"" totally deserves it! If you are a fan of 80's and 90's sci-fi & horror, this show was made for you. Even if you just want a real good, gripping, scary thriller to get into, this is it. It's a truly amazing piece of work! Bravo!",10
North America,"With all the hype about ""Stranger Things"" and with so many friends and colleagues watching it, I came about and had to watch it as well. And sat down to watch all episodes of the first season on two evenings.While ""Stranger Things"" certainly is entertaining, it is not all that Regardless, it should be said that ""Stranger Things"" is entertaining, and the storyline is well-thought through and equally so executed on the screen at the hands of directors Matt Duffer and Ross Duffer. They managed to build up a good continuation of the story and fair level of mystery.However, there were aspects of the series that didn't really appeal all that well to me. For example, the whole thing with the strange girl good as the hype had it made up to be. Perhaps this was because I was expecting something more grand from the series, giving all the hype.Known as ""11"". Sure, she was vital to the storyline, but personally I didn't care much for her story and her contribution to it. Mind you, that I am not saying that Millie Bobby Brown didn't act well, because she most certainly did.And while we are on the topic of actors, then it should be said that they had managed to get to get a great ensemble of acting talents, both familiar and new faces. And they all contributed quite well to the series. I especially enjoyed Winona Ryder (playing Joyce Byers) and David Harbour (playing Jim Hopper).The effects in ""Stranger Things"" were good, and used in fair moderation. Personally I think it was a bit of a shame that they held back with the special effects, because it would have spiced up the show so much more.The creature was nicely made and had some good design. But it was just too easily defeated in my opinion, which was somewhat of an anti-climatic moment.There is certainly a good amount of H. P. Lovecraft and Spielberg influence behind the construction of ""Stranger Things"" and it reflects on the screen.It was a great treat to witness the amount of effort they had gone through to make the magic of the 1980s come back to life. And they did that quite successfully. And as a fan of the Dungeons & Dragons game, it was a wonderful treat with the element of D&D shown in ""Stranger Things"".""Stranger Things"" was entertaining enough, but I felt sort of disappointed, because I had initially expecting something much more grand and memorable. But still, it was fun to watch. And as such, I am rating ""Stranger Things"" six out of ten stars; based on what I have seen in season one only.",6
North America,"Allow me to explain myself when it comes to my standards: I want something that amazes me. I want something with outstanding writing, appearance, acting, characters, and I judge my entries with those categories in mind.Writing Stranger Things, I believe, excelled in this area most of the time. The plot moved forward at a reasonable pace. Nothing felt too rushed or too dragged out. However, several things that occur felt too forced in without consulting common logic first. I'm mostly talking about Hawkins' decision to let the chief go free. Let's review: he broke into a government facility, saw some top-secret classified stuff, and his only punishment is a wiretap in (only) his house? This honestly feels like the writers were pushed into a corner with no logical way out. Another point to consider is the fact that nothing is either explained or implied; we, the audience, are just supposed to accept that happens with nothing built on top. What is this Upside-Down? Is it the work of supernatural forces? Aliens? Science gone wrong? What about the Hawkins' laboratory? Are there other kids part of the experiments? How did 11 manage to escape in the first place? How did the chief get to the bottom floor of a top-secret government facility without so much as a gun shot at him? Aside from this nit-picking, the writing is solid throughout, but lacks logic when need be. Score: 7/10Appearances: This is where Stranger Things truly shines. The directing does a beautiful job of bringing out those intense scenes. The visuals are nothing short of stunning. If I had to give a complaint, it would be ""Does the Upside-Down have to be completely gray?"". The music only further emphasizes the emotion and impact of every scene. It's actually a memorable score, the title card theme being the shining example of that. Score: 10/10Acting: A shining, but less impactful element in Stranger Things. The emotions that the characters bring are truly something to gawk at. The main problem with having a primary cast of children is usually the acting, and this is no exception. A lot of the acting done by the kids feels over-dramatized to the point of being hilarious. Winona Ryder I think carried the series with her amazing portrayal of a mother on the verge of insanity. Every time she was on screen I was prepared to see some crazy stuff happen. Score: 8/10Characters: Something Stranger Things fails at is having believable characters. While the plot chugs away doing its thing, it leaves no room for character familiarity or development. The main character, Mike, is a typical middle schooler that plays D&D with his friends: Dustin, the typical gluttonous kid, Lucas, whose only character trait is being jealous of Mike and having a dad that fought in Vietnam, and Will, who gets around 15 minutes of total screen time. Got to include not one, but two sets of two-dimensional bullies! I wish Steve got more screen time, as the series ended just as he was becoming interesting. Nancy has no personality at all. She can shoot a gun, and that's the only character trait she has. Jonathan also suffers from having pretty much no personality. He's shown as being a loner in school and a member of the photography club, but that's all there is to his character. The rest of the characters have even less personality; they're just stuck in as filler characters so the scenes would be less lonely. At least Hopper and Joyce were interesting, albeit also a bit lacking. Score: 2/10Stranger Things has a few things going for it, but not enough to be too excited over. The writing was solidly done, but lacking in logic at times. The appearances are nothing short of breathtaking, each moment being encapsulated with a score and visuals to remember. The acting was all-around solidly done. The kids, however, ruin the immersion of having believable people be part of the story. The characters fell completely flat, as every single one has a few bullet points attached to their name. None of them come off as believable people, just as plot points in a story.Final Score: 7/10More Personal Thoughts: Here's how you check to see if your characters come off as people. If you remember their name hours after you finished watching, then you've at least partially succeeded. I had to keep referencing the cast list because I forgot almost all of the characters' names.",7
North America,"Dungeons & Dragons, Eggo Waffles, Winona Ryder in Mom Jeans, Super Powers, and More in Netflix's 'Stranger Things'!'Stranger Things' Season 1 is The Hit Show of The Summer!What can I say about Netflix's hit original series Stranger Things that hasn't already been said? I know I am a little late to the party. But, Stranger Things is one of the best Netflix original series you should definitely be watching! If you were a child of the 1980s, or if you simply are a fan of the films of the 1980s, Netflix's new series Stranger Things will satisfy you, entertaining you, creep you out, and overall it's a blast!This thrilling Netflix original stars award-winning actress Winona Ryder (Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands) as Joyce Byers, who lives in a small Indiana town with her older son in 1983. When Joyce's 12-year-old son, Will, played by Noah Schnapp (Bridge of Spies) goes missing, she launches an investigation with the local police chief Jim Hooper, played by David Harbour (The Equalizer, A Walk Among the Tombstones) into his disappearance. As they search for answers, they unravel a series of extraordinary mysteries involving secret government experiments, and unnerving supernatural forces. Meanwhile, Will's three friends are also determined to find him when they find a scared girl, played by Millie Brown (2014s Intruders television show) who calls herself Eleven (after the numeric tattoo on her arm) and possesses supernatural abilities.Okay for starters, let's talk about the characters. You care what happens to ALL the characters in Stranger Things, because they're written authentically and they're cast exceptionally, especially when it comes to the kids. The kids come off as real kids, and what real kids would do in these types of situations. Brown, makes Eleven scary, sad, funny and sweet, especially in scenes shared with the other kids. I believe she is the breakout star in this series. Gaten Matarazzo's Dustin, may be short on teeth but long on hilarious dialogue, and grew on me with each episode. As did Ryder, the chief of police, the kids, and all the characters. You want to see these characters proved right, you want them to seek justice, and you want the underdogs to win. Every character is so well written and rounded, that I found myself emotionally connecting to every single character.From the moment Stranger Things begins, you can feel the influences that have guided series creators Matt Duffer and Ross Duffer (Wayward Pines). The film is flooded with '80s nostalgia. To me, this feels like a Stephen King book. That have would have become a movie, directed by Steven Spielberg or John Carpenter (or both!). Obviously, the risk is that this could all just feel like a tribute that's fun, but with no real identify of its own. However, Stranger Things manages to create a compelling world of its own, centered on a group of very relatable, likable characters, an interesting story, and entertaining.Style over Substance?Even though this series takes place in the '80s, it takes more place in the movies of the 80s. Meaning, this ""real"" world that we're watching feels more like a '80s film we would have watched. One small complaint I have is the story could have been just a little bit more original. It's cool the show has all these cool little Easter eggs to the '80s. However, some of the things that happen in the series, you will know it from other iconic '80s films. Such as, films like E.T. The Goonies, and Carrie.T his show isn't just for fans of the '80s and people who grew up in that era. I feel like this is a series everyone can enjoy. Even though I am curious to what today's youth audience would think of this film. Would they enjoy and respect the series like some of the older viewers? So these are my final Bitchin' Buddha thoughts on Netflix's original series Stranger Things season one. It's an interesting blend of horror, comedy, drama, science fiction, nostalgia, and I believe this series is extremely well done. It is something you can watch alone, by yourself, over again, and there is something here for everyone. I believe Stanger Things season one earns a9/10!And just like a Christmas present I'm gonna wrap this up. Until next time, this review is brought to you by Boogie Buddha, and remember, don't just get down, but get Boogie. Thank you all for reading and or viewing, and I hope you all have an amazing day as always. Peace out. :)",9
North America,"I have recommended this show to all my friends. And most of them love it too. So much fun. I really miss the 80's. I was a little nerd myself. This was so exciting and fresh. It got me hooked after the first episode. Netflix and HBO are the kings of series. I thinks it's so awesome how big and good Netflix has become. They keep making excellent series. I also really love Narcos. That show too is really good.I am looking forward to season 2 of this show. I was so glad when I read that the season 2 was coming next year. To all the people that make this happened at Netflix, Thank You. You make my life better. And Thank You creators and actors of this show, for making me forget about all that is bad in life. Taking me with to this new world.This really is nothing short of a home run. Bravo! :)",10
North America,"Firstly, don't get me wrong; the casting, acting, direction, editing and visuals here are second to none.But I really don't get the show. Admittedly I'm only half way through season 1, so my opinions might change, but I just don't get all the praise for the show. It's just, to me anyway, a ""throw it all in and hope for the best"" mix of previous 80's hits.So. You've got a bunch of kids chasing something they don't know or understand. They work out some weird meaning that the adults simply wont understand and they go on a crazy secret mission to catch the bad guys. It's all very Goonies/BMX Bandits. Then it goes into a modern horror Hemlock Grove type adult horror territory entering an utterly genreless confusion.Its like Spielberg took a Stephen King story and asked John Carpenter to direct it. And John Carpenter said, ""F%%% off, do it yourself"". So it ended up a potentially good horror ruined by Spielberg family values and cuddliness.Like I say, it is well directed and acted and looks great. All the 80's stuff is cool (except for the almost constant and monotonous 80's electro duna duna duna duna background music which seems cool at first but soon becomes really annoying).But if you want 80's cute kids having adventures, watch The Goonies or BMX Bandits again. If you want weird horror goings on in a grown person environment, watch Hemlock Grove.But like I say, I'm only half way through the first season . . . .21/09/2016. Watched final episode and my opinion is . . . .It's not a kids thing, it's not a grown ups thing, it's not even a tweeny thing. It is A thing, of sorts. And there's bound to be second season. I'll probably watch and complain about that too.",7
North America,"The only thing missed was Michael Knight and his trans-am. The creators did a tremendous job capturing the aura of an era, I don't think I can contribute with something about this series that it hasn't been told yet, It's hard for me to give an honest evaluation because it makes you nostalgic since the intro,so I found my self emotionally compromised, the setting is just amazing.They did a great cast selection,it's the first time in a very long that I don't find the acting-kids annoying, the only thing I can complain of is that it could have been more suspense's scenes, but in my opinion we have another great and laudable piece by our friends of Netflix.",9
North America,"I found this series on Netflix not so long ago, at first I wasn't quite sure whether or not I liked it. It was a bit hard to follow at the beginning, but by the third episode I was caught. There were a few times when I wasn't sure what was going on. But, I must admit, I love it and wish season two was on Netflix.The story line is original and I find myself very intrigued to find out what happens next. I have also found myself contemplating what might happen.I would recommend this to anyone who loves supernatural or mystery orientated shows.And one request: Netflix, please release season two!",8
North America,"Yes, i like! Very much! Didn't expect it was so good. I am hooked. WhatI don't like are the scary parts. Not a big fan of scary stuff. I like the science-fiction, the 80s, the soundtrack, the mystery. Well written, well directed. Very good cast. AND that it is ""inspired and aesthetically informed by the works of Steven Spielberg, John Carpenter, Stephen King, Robert Zemeckis and George Lucas, among others."" (wikipedia) Just cool to watch, I just forget everything around me and am 100% focused on what happens. So GREAT =) I want this series to last for at least more than ## seasons. Thers is so much potential to so it could last for so much more seasons than the first end the scond that is coming in spring of 2017. Please let it last!!! THANX",9
North America,"My daughter in college called me and said ""Mom you have to watch this new show on Netflix."" Her and her boyfriend sat and watched all 8 shows. I looked at it and thought not another alien kid show. My husband and I sat down and was hooked after the first show! We also watched all 8 shows. I liked the fact it was clean. I get so tired of shows basing everything with foul mouths and sex in every other shot. You can let your kids watch it and not worry when you get up for the popcorn that they are going to have their little minds corrupted, But watch out it is spooky, but also funny. I fell in love with all the characters. The only thing I don't like is I have to wait till next year for the show!! UGH!! Good job guys.",9
North America,"I usually don't like the Science fiction type, but with all the hype around"" The Stranger Things""I decided to give it a try . And I wasn't disappointed, in fact I new by the 5/10 first minutes that I was going to look the whole season . The actors was so good, especially the kids , which usually are not so great in other TV shows ( Walking dead for instance ) The 80's era was totally there, even If I was born in the late 80's I could feel the atmosphere .The cool thing about that Show is that each episode are increasing in intensity as long as you are progressing .I didn't gave a 10 stars because , first the perfection doesn't exist ^^, and secondly because sometimes it felt a little bit too much cliché( I wouldn't say predictable )which make me fell feel that there was a little bit of lack of originality . Having said that, I got to tell that it's one of the best TV show that it was given me to watch, top ten for sure !",9
North America,"I think it's a series that works if you did not see any other series in your life, but as we have several top ... I found it boring and predictable. The performances are fine, no big deal. There is no character to stand out or wanting to know more. The plot is incoherent and has absurd moments. There are several events and situations of the series that made me ask, ""Really?"". Moments where the courage of some characters becomes impossible to believe; moments where science fiction and suspense are distorted by the illogical and unreasonable actions ... I think that a plot can play with unintelligible, enigmatic and irrational but always maintaining a certain internal consistency, with believable characters who were developing their skills and potential throughout history. Here many issues for granted are met, we move from fear to action without any mediation. Scenes that seem serious arise and end up being naive. They try to create an atmosphere of mystery that quickly becomes imbecility. Anyway, it seems a bad series. Maybe would have worked a little better as a movie.",3
North America,"I agree that viewers can fill in some details, but there are so many logical flaws in this show which contradicts with itself. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying the show is bad. Actually I pretty enjoy the show, the costumes and scenes are pretty real. The actors are acting well, especially for those kids. However one of joys I have during the time watching the show is to see how many logical flaws it has. Here is some I can remember now:1. Why did they (lab guys) kill the big cook but not sheriff? The big cook (at beginning) just met a lost girl and report to government. They can simply pretend as government employee (they do have the power to do it) who are supposed to take care of lost kids and pick the girl up. It's definitely not necessary to kill a guy. OK, we can just accept this as an assumption in the show: they are evil guys. Their working style is killing people to cover up the truth to make 100% sure for their secrets. Then why they didn't kill the sheriff? He definitely knows much more secret since he has already got into the lab and seen a lot of secrets. Is it just because he is one of the main characters?2. Why did the lab guys want to make a fake body of lost kid? First of all, why did they think the lost boy had any relations with their lab or secret. The boy was caught by the monster, the lab guys should not even know it. During that time, they didn't even know much about the monster or if it has offensive action. (They sent a single guy without power weapon or good supports later and didn't expect the death of that man.) OK, we can accept that they are too nervous and believe the lost boy is caused by their secret project. Then if they really want to cover up their secret, they need to let as less people involved as possible and treat that accident as a normal lost kid case (Sending some Amber Alert on highway or similar...). Then after several months, no one except the parents would care about it. However what they did was calling up tens of cops and several ambulance to perform a big show (for whom?), making a big news to let everyone in the world knows the accident, and then they made a fake body by some kind of silicon skin with cotton stuffing... Are you serious?3. How did Will contact with his mother? It seems that several assumptions had made for this: (a) The upside down world has exact same objects as the real world (street, house...); (b) People in the upside down world can hear the sound from real world, but cannot see anything in the real world (people, fire...) (c) When people in the upside down world getting close to light bubble, the bubble in real world will on. However how did Will figure that he can light on the bubbles in the real world? He cannot see anything happened in the real world. Then how could he know to light the bubble on by going close to it?Alright, we can assumption Will is a really really smart and brave boy and he was staying home all the time and listening to his mother's response to the light and eventually figured out this mechanism. Then how did he send words to his mother? I mean when his mother paints the characters on the wall, can Will see the same character at the same position in the upside down world? Can Will see the same light bubble there too? ?I didn't see them at the upside down scene.) If yes, did he see some bubbles flying in the air when his mother setting these bubbles? Did he see the door opening and closing by itself when his brother getting in and out the house at real world? Why they cannot see something like fire, bat or all these stuffs when sheriff and Will's mother came to his house? What will it response in the real world if they damage something in the upside down world?All these basic assumptions about environmental correlation between two worlds are full of flaws. It seems they made assumption at first and then twisted it whenever the story needs.There are still a lot flaws I didn't mention. Such as:4. How did the monster travel between two worlds (Need the gate or not)?5. How could sheriff get into the big lab building for the first time without any preparation or guide then directly get to the most inner and secret room? (The building was full of camera and guards).6. If three teenagers with only a small gun, a trap, gas fire can stop and beat the monster away, why not tens of trained guys with machine guns cannot do the same thing? What's more ironically, even 3 kids with a small slingshot can slow down the monster.7. If the monster is sensitive to blood, the first thing it would get probably is the fresh meet in kitchen, right? (Now I'm kidding :) )",7
North America,"Stranger Things (2016): Stranger things is the most hyped and critically acclaimed series of 2016.I just couldn't stop myself writing this review after watching its finale.So how is it?Plot:On November 6, 1983 in the town of Hawkins,Indiana, 12-year-old Will Byers (Noah Schnapp) vanishes mysteriously. Will's frantic mother, Joyce (Winona Ryder), searches for him while Police Chief Jim Hopper (David Harbour) launches his own investigation. Will's friends Mike (Finn Wolfhard),Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) and Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin) discover a psychokinetic girl named Eleven (Millie Brown) who claims to know Will's location.Mike's sister Nancy (Cara Buono) who has in relationship with Steve (Joe Keery) teams up with Jonathan Bryers (Charlie Heaton),brother of Will Bryers to investigate the mystery of the disappearance of her friend Barbara (Shannon Purser). As all of them uncover the truth, a sinister government agency tries to cover it up, while a more insidious force lurks below the surface.Plus Points:1)Performances: Casting is the major highlight of Stranger Things.Each and every actor in this series played their roles with perfection.We cannot highlight any one because everyone gave award winning performance.Winona Ryder as grieving mother,Millie Brown as psycho kinetic girl,the kids,Charlie Heaton,Cara Buono, everyone are brilliant.This show is a proof of true hidden talents.2)Engaging screenplay: Stranger Things is highly engaging in every episode.There is exactly no dull moments in all of the eight episodes.Every episode has its own mark and ends with suspense note.The way they showed all the stories in parallel way is brilliant as all of them got equal priority.It is emotional,scary,thrilling,cute and some times funny too.3)Direction: Stranger Things can be considered as an exceptional hard work of The Duffer brothers.These guys are brilliant and got success in bringing a masterpiece in retro style.Though they got inspired from 80's style works of Spielberg's The Goonies where bunch of kids try to solve a mystery.Its their vision which made this show a masterpiece.4)Setting: The way they showed the setting of 1980's is awesome,They are so real that we can easily get dragged into the show.5)Music: Music in Stranger Things is terrific and played a crucial role in its pacing,Especially its theme is haunting and never leaves our mind.Minus Points: There are none but I feel that VFX is bit poor.So,Stranger Things is one of the best TV series of all time.It is brilliant engaging drama thriller where every minute keeps you at the edge of the seat for entire 8 episodes.Waiting for season 2.My rating 10/10",10
North America,"I grew up watching a lot of 90's show where the main protagonist has some kind of super powers and this show is no different.The fact that it's tagged as Horror has nothing to do with ""horror"". Its like a toned down version of E.T movie for 8 year old kids.The show is mostly about a bunch of kids fighting to make themselves heard in an adult world, this is why this show is so popular among kids. The ""horror"" part of the movie is just an after thought.Stranger things keeps baiting the audience by dangling little hints of horror and super powers in 3 secs scenes just to keep the audience entertained and hooked, but the rest of the screen time is just petty problems of kids and adolescents trying to do the right things.",1
North America,Absolutely no original ideas in it!! Everything is so predictable... Not bad but far from good. You have to be 10 years old (or a lady Xerox-gaga fan) to be overwhelmed by this show which is just a copy of what has been done before. A very big disappointment! Everything here has been seen over and over again on screen and TV series so nothing to be surprised about. You can see from far what's coming up way before it actually happens. Of course it's all about the 80th but some original ideas would have been more than welcome. Nice series to watch but not much more than a 6/10. There is so many more series that are way better than this one. Let's hope there will be some changes in season 2 but i have a lot of doubts...its so easy to copycat.......,6
North America,WOW! This was amazing! It takes every single 80's movie you've ever seen and smashes it together. I watched this show in less then 1 week and I loved it! 3 out of 5 people in my family are watching it or have already watched it. I would say this is certainly the best show I have ever watched besides Buffy the Vampire Slayer and maybe Sherlock. Each episode just gets better and better. I cannot wait for season 2. The characters are just great! and I love how many genres this show has. Get Netflix and watch this show NOW! I have so many good things to say about this show. I will never forget how good this show is! The acting's great! The theme song is great! Watch this right NOW!,10
North America,"First off, I'm not an Eighties movies fan, not in the sense that I don't like those movies, but more of that I haven't really watched that many of them, at least not the ones that Stranger Things supposedly pays homage to.That being said, what made me love this series clearly wasn't nostalgia. How do I put it into words? To understand, you'll probably have to watch it yourself to find out.The premise is simple enough. A boy disappears, and his friends try to find him. Along the way, they become entangled in strange supernatural incidents, that is the monsters/conspiracy theory kind. It starts with a slow but sure pace, gradually turning on the suspense, with revelation after another coming as the plot thickens and develops superbly.There's solid acting from the cast: the kids, Winona Ryder and David Harbour; some people complain about Winona Ryder's overacting, but how else would you expect a mother whose child disappears to be like? The kids are also instantly likable and convincing, with a refreshing spirit that shines through.The story develops very well, but it isn't of the countless convoluted plot twists kind: simple enough, but pulls you in anyhow. It draws inspiration from the 80's sci-fi/horror genre, but it's not frightening or scary, instead, what stands out, at least for me, is the underlying mood. Sure, their friend has disappeared, but they always have the admirable childlike hope and enthusiasm; there isn't any sense of despair among them. Even their love of science, especially with their science teacher, is infectious. Nostalgia certainly didn't get me, but perhaps what did is the amalgam of sci-fi, fantasy, science, mystery and suspense that is this show.So thank you Netflix for making this show happen. I mean, House Of Cards was great(I binged-watched it too), but Stranger Things was something else altogether. For a moment(a very long one), it made me feel like I was back reading LOTR again, wishing and trying so hard to believe in magic...trying to convince myself that it was all real.",10
North America,"A story about childhood and kids. About friendship and love. In this respect, this movie harks back to a better tradition. Before the blood and gore video games of today.Strong performances by the adults. Amazing performances by the kids.On the negative side, plot is an amalgamation of Carrie, Firestarter and bump-in-the-night.Runs out of suspense about half way when it turns into an action movie. The ending felt a little unsatisfactory.Less melodrama and more perspective, please.Still, the actors carry the series most of the way. Hope that the second season has enough gas left in the tank.",7
North America,"If you haven't watched Stranger things yet watch it now!Seriously do not read anything about. Just watch it by yourself. But be careful! Next 8 hours of your life will be filled by watching this show. But it's worth it! You'll find a lot of references to Spielberg's movies, works of Stephen King, Lynch.Everything is on the high level: the plot, the montage, the music, the acting (This is the best part!). Young actors literally stunned me, especially Millie Bobby Brown.If you feel nostalgia about 80's and your childhood, if you like adventures and mystery, if deep in your mind you are the same kid, you'll enjoy it.Do you really want to see the rate?11/10",10
North America,"Wonderful homage to the films of the 70's and 80's. There is heavy leaning on John Carpenter, Steven Spielberg, Chris Columbus, Joe Dante, and Tobe Hooper among others. If you are of the correct generation, Boomer myself, you can watch for the numerous allusions; and applaud the set and costume designer for the collection of memorabilia you can spot. Pretty sure I saw an AMC Pacer and Gremlin on the streets.The story moves along at a brisk pace and each episode ends with a cliff-hanger that just about demands you stay and binge watch the entire series: thankfully there were only eight episodes because my wife and I were up until one a.m. finishing off series one.Both of us were impressed with the acting of the young ""Goonies""; and we argued over who David Harbour reminded us of: I am holding to my opinion of Jack Nicholson. And Winona Ryder just disappeared into Joyce Byers.Overall, a fun roller coaster that comes to a satisfactory stop, and the promise of a bigger and faster ride coming for those of us in the queue.",10
North America,"For starters, guys who glorify this series shall use the money they've received for it to buy some taste, knowledge and experience. This show is really nothing special. Some Super 8, some Star Wars, some Stephen King, some Goonies ... Nothing original and creative. Lacks humor. Winona Ryder is overacting. Kids are OK but aren't they in any show? David Harbour is OK - seems to me he was the only one to find measure in dosing his efforts. Credits shall also got to Billie Bobby Brown. The show is too slow and basically nothing really happens until the last episode, when again nothing significant happens. Everything seems like: ""Guys, write something in a way that it ends or not in the first season, depending on advertisers and money income."" Everything in this show is black & white. Good guys are good, bad are bad (as in Government), naive and stupid are naive and stupid and so on. Too many clichés. Childish at best.Not worth watching and certainly not worth another season. Forget this ever happened and I'll try to forgive the Duffer brothers. Do we have a deal?",3
North America,"Stranger Things is written & directed by The Duffer Brothers and stars Winona Ryder, David Harbour, Finn Wolfhard, Millie Bobby Brown, Gaten Matarazzo, Caleb McLaughlin, Natalia Dyer, Charlie Heaton, Noah Schnapp and Cara Buono.When a young boy disappears, his mother, a police chief, and his friends must confront terrifying forces in order to get him back.Where to begin? Stranger Things is one of the most enjoyable pieces of television that I've experienced in years. With a satisfying eight episodes in its first season, The Duffer Brothers have delivered a multi- genre masterpiece that has taken the world by storm.The writing throughout is smart and compelling, lending every actor/actress a real chance to delve into their respective characters and they all do so with impeccable skill. It's extremely difficult to pick out the highlighting performances when every single one of them were outstanding. But, I must mention the following names in appreciation of their talent. Millie Bobby Brown is seriously convincing in her portrayal of the mysterious Eleven (or 'Elle'), and although only twelve years old, she gives one of the most incredibly diverse and grown-up performances I've ever seen. Winona Ryder plays a distraught Joyce, mother of Will, who goes through many stages of emotional despair, breaking down and falling apart as she searches for her son, in an impressive and relatable act. Charlie Heaton follows Ryder in this path but takes a slightly different direction as he becomes one of the many powerful leads in the series, within a couple episodes. Heaton has undeniable chemistry with co-star Natalia Dyer (playing Nancy) and they both share some interesting moments together, most notably, in the final three episodes. David Harbour plays police chief, Jim Hopper, and progressively propels into his character as he digs deeper into the strange 'missing boy' case. Last but certainly not least, the Kids (Finn Wolfhard, Gaten Matarazzo & Caleb McLaughlin) are enthralling, fascinating and hugely entertaining as they search for their friend, Will (Noah Schnapp), and ultimately take the screen with surprisingly genuine, adult performances. Highlighting Matarazzo (Dustin) and Wolfhard (Mike) as my consistent favourites during my experience with the show.Kyle Dixon & Michael Stein are in control of the score, taking huge inspiration from the 1980s, using synthesisers to construct an incredible ensemble soundtrack that in some way feels like its own character. Along with the show taking critical acclaim, the soundtrack manages to find an audience, be it fans of the show, composers, directors, producers, it seems everyone wants this sound in their work. Dixon & Stein have crafted and presented a stunning score, from the opening theme to the closing credits.Something the show creators, set decorators, designers and costume departments have worked hard on is featuring many references paying homage to classic 70s/80s movies, and while it's packed with them, the writers strive in staying original in the storytelling. The plot is seemingly simple, yet once you begin watching you notice how complex it really is. Every episode is filled with mystery and tension. Even when you think the story is heading somewhere predictable, it alters drastically and heads off in another direction. I strongly believe that this is greatly due to its short run of eight episodes. There's no 'filler' episode in this show. It's an entirely fast-paced, energetic and powerful running length which will have you binge watching until you've seen it all. Lucky for us, a second season has been confirmed by Netflix, with a further nine episodes coming in 2017.Verdict; There's simply nothing quite like Stranger Things. It's enthralling, engaging, emotional, heartfelt, funny, smart, complex and certainly entertains the viewer. Did I mention it also has a killer soundtrack? You're right, I did. - Stranger Things is now streaming on Netflix.Stranger Things: Season One, 10/10.",9
North America,"I gave 8 because ,i really loved the plot and it made a grasp to my interest that made me expect what will happen next. I would have given 10 , if most background sounds are less audible than the interacting voices.In most places i had to use subtitles to know what they are speaking about because of those background sound.I really liked that young lady who played the ""Eleven"" character, she is beautiful and cute.I hope you would bring her for the next season, i forgot to mention those 4 friends,They kinda interesting,funny in most parts. And i should really say , i am definitely expecting your next season , better make it soon.Best regards ,",8
North America,"""Stranger things"" is essentially ""Goonies"" meets ""Alien"". A fine blend of adventure and horror, with an 80s retro vibe that immerses you in a completely believable world. It undoubtedly engrosses anyone who sits down to watch. The direction is excellent and the performances, especially the ones from the young cast, will surprise you.As everyone will tell you, there is a cast of extremely talented young boys at the center of the plot, but Millie Bobby Brown as ""Eleven"" is a revelation - a young Sigourney Weaver that fights an equally terrifying ""Alien"". Millie has everyone out there ranting and raving about her, and deservedly so. It seems ""Stranger Things"" is going to be remembered in the future as the pedestal for the launching of her career as a major star. Millie approaches a very difficult and demanding role, that's stripped down verbally and has to be essentially performed using body language, with the maturity of a much older actress.The only problem with ""Stranger Things"", honestly, is, how the next season or seasons will be able to live up to the audience's elevated expectations! ""Stranger Things"" has set the bar very high for its own good. Here is to hoping the Duffer Brothers know what they are doing and they will not disappoint!",9
North America,"If you somehow think ""Back to the Future"" movies and series represents the height of storytelling and think American horror flics from the eighties are ""cool"" then this will be entertaining. Maybe you will feel that way if you were born in the eighties like the Duffer brothers.On the other hand, if you put any demands on TV-shows also of this type, then you're wasting your time. I just wasted it for nine episodes in the hope of some nice twists. What utter boring old crap this series is made of. The logical wasteland that is the story and the one-dimensional storytelling and acting will bore you. You could put a supertanker in the plot holes which is exasperating considering the high quality of TV-scripts these days. This kind of thing only could fly in the eighties and while Stranger Things is grounded in the eighties, it's not a very entertaining aspect to adopt also the stupid antics from that era. Stranger Things could have been great, but it's so small minded it's downright painful.The acting overall is barely acceptable. Not the worst I've seen and most actors do what they can with this weak material I guess.Winona makes a somewhat convincing mother and David Harbour has presence most of the time. The boys Finn, Caleb and Gaten, well I guess they're doing OK. The only one that stands out though is Millie Bobby Brown that manages to have charisma and mystique just by being there on screen. She's hardly worth going trough all the episodes for, but her performance should be noted. She can't save the story though. Waste your time on this at your own peril and make sure to check your brain at the door!",3
North America,"This TV show is about as nice to watch as a Disney movie. It's certainly entertaining in its own manner. However if it was not for some effects that are typical for Horror movies like ""Poltergeist"" and many others I would say it is more appropriate for Children than for adults.Some boys around the age of 12 are fighting bad guys and a monster from a parallel world who is responsible for the disappearance of their friend who now is not available to play board games anymore. They have a girl with Superpowers helping them. The bad guys are trying to find the girl with the Superpower so the boys help her to hide.The boy who has disappeared also has his mother trying to find him. In this she is being supported by the Police Chief.Then there is a side plot with some adolescents behaving like - well, adolescents, or better like adolescents in American movies for adolescents. One is the guy all girls are after, the other one is the outsider the girl falls in love with. Of course the adolescents - or at least some of them - are involved in fighting the evil monster. However the adolescents still find enough time to party and to drink beer, but sometimes they happen to be kidnapped by the monster.All of this is funny and nice to watch, but after all that hype I would have certainly expected much more than a mixture between ""Poltergeist"" and The Famous Five.",6
North America,As i watched stranger things i would say this series was excellent and had very good suspenseful Moments. While watching the show i noticed that every time Will tried to contact his mother or either his friends it was done using electricity. Electricity played a big role in this cause in the series Will was basically trapped in an underworld that was considered different from our world everything was much more darker compared. They also made friends with with a girl named Eleven whose named was shortened to El. In the show she was a test subject in a psychiatric ward by her farther. She met Mike they started too fall for each other but she also ended up helping him and his friends get back into contact with will.In one part of the show it shows the viewer how these people are brought into the underworld it is also well enough explained how one must get there by creating just enough electricity that nobody not even humans could possibly make.Believe it or not this all started over a game involving a demogorgon .Overall i feel like this series is good for any mystery and suspense class its fun and addictive.,10
North America,As i watched stranger things i would say this series was excellent and had very good suspenseful Moments. While watching the show i noticed that a lot of energy and electricity was involved with making contacting to friends and family. Energy was used throughout the show because their a girl named eleven that you would eventually meet and she can moving things and use radios. Their a certain part in the show where elevens father tried to make her kill a cat using her energy but she couldn't . Since she couldn't do it her father had her taking away and she ended up hurting the guards.In one part of the show it shows the viewer how these people are brought into the underworld it is also well enough explained how one must get there by creating just enough electricity that nobody not even humans could possibly make. Nancy's friend barb ended up getting dragged there from steves pool and the demogorgon ended up killing her. At the end El used her energy to kill this demogorgon so that everyone else could live. This was a great show and something that i would watch a season 2 of,9
North America,As the show continues to throw unexpected twists and turns i find myself stuck on one thing trying to figure out what happened. There a lot of electric moments where there's lights flickering and beams of lights in the dark. There is a whole other world where if blood is in the real world then this monster comes out and begins attacking.Then the girl that looks like a boy is getting hunted down by her father because he know that she has super powers.The biggest part of the story line is to figure out where will is. Will is in another word and he can communicate in lights and other ways. There is a moment in the show where some people say it was will that got pulled out of the water but his friends knew that it wasn't him.,4
North America,"Strangers Things is overall a good show, consisting of horror, adventure, and suspense. The cast was absolutely amazing considering how young they were. The show focuses a lot on energy and the power it has in the town of Hawkins. Every time the monster is near it always mess with the electricity around it, for example turning off lights and messing with telephones. Will use the power of energy from the underworld to communicate with his mom, to let her know where he is and to tell her he was alive. She then started buy a lot of Christmas lights and putting them around her house so she can communicate with her son. While this was happening everyone around her started thinking she was insane. When they found wills body, the light didn't stop communicating with Joyce(wills mom) which made her think will was still alive. It turns out the body was fake because the scientist/government have planted it on purpose to attract the attention off of themselves. Hopper(Sheriff) realize that they were the ones who took will or knew something about his disappearance. It turns out everything from will disappearance, the monsters, El (eleven) was all connected to them. The kids Dustin, Eleven, Mike, and Lucas went on their own mission to find will with the help of eleven powers. While looking for will the government was chasing them to get eleven back. The whole show is basically base on the power of energy and science of experimentation. Everyone who's about to be taken all the power around them goes off and when they turn back on, their gone. Although my review is an 9/10 i was still say is a show you want to watch. It could've easily been a solid 10/10 if the show haven't been so predictable and consist of many more horrifying events. Overall i recommend it to everyone, very entertaining and you will feel a since of connections to the characters.",9
North America,"stranger things has a lot of electricity and energy moments.most moments are usually when the demogorgon is in the scene or they sense it. for example the scene when he took will he used the shed lights and the phone to scare him. in another scene where that was used was when will was trying to connect with his mother and he communicated with her with lights. there are also suspenseful moment like when eleven goes into the pool to go and find barb, also when barb and will disappeared. i feel that this show gave us many high hopes for the next season. also i like that the show didn't give many hints so it would always keep up guessing. this show is very interesting its has many unexpected moments and i cant wait for season two to come out",10
North America,"The show Stranger Things has many, many electric and suspenseful moments. Some of the moments when the electricity starts going crazy is when the demogorgon comes around. Also, the demogorgon comes around when it's triggered blood. For example when Eleven killed her Papa and his workers, there was a lot of blood so it triggered the demogorgon. Another example when the electricity was going crazy was when Will was communicating with his mother through the lights in his house. Some energy moments that happened in this show was when Barb was sitting at the pool alone waiting for Nancy. Barb was bleeding so that triggered the demogorgon. We didn't know what happened to Barb. Was she alive? or was she dead? Another suspenseful moment was when Will fell off his bike and ran into his shed, and the lights flickered and then he disappeared. Was he okay? Who or What took him?",10
North America,"Stranger Things had a lot of suspenseful moments and overall the show in my opinion is excellent and has a lot of electricity and energy movements throughout the show. The most was when the electricity and energy movement occurred was when the Demogorgon appeared or when will was trying to communicate to someone. For example, when Will's mom was trying to communicate with him she used lights and wrote the ABCs on the wall and had him use that to communicate with her. The most suspenseful moments in the show would have to be when Eleven was basically put into the pool of water and she had to use her ""powers"" to communicate or try and find Barbs and Will. When she went we got to see the view of how the Underground world looks like and how things are. Another scene would have to be when El went to go defeat the Demon and her last word were "" i'm sorry mike"". She defeated the Demon to save everyone's life. The show is very very good and I would definitely recommend it to others. The show leaves us wanting to continue more and more after each episode and I literally cannot wait for Season 2!!!!!!!",10

North America,"Stranger things has a bunch of interesting moments that are filled with electrical events such as when Joyce tried to communicate with Will in her house and all the Christmas lights flickered, or when she answered the phone and it electrocuted her and broke. Also in the shed when the light bulb flickered during the search. There were many suspenseful moments. One suspenseful moment was when the demogorgon appeared in the house when Nancy and Jonathan were alone. Also when Joyce was in the room trying to communicate with Will and the paint was showing up in order of words. When they found the body in The woods and they thought it was wills. Another exciting/ suspenseful moment was when 11 was in the water tank and she had the dream and the whole building went falling.",9
North America,"9? This is what happens when a culture of hype, trend and Netflix zombies rate things. Ratings no longer signify a good movie or show. They just shows what's trending. How did this crap ever get made? Did someone notice a bunch of online teens saying that they're 80s or that they wish they were 80s and Netflix decided to make a show on a Web trend? This whole show is just a spot the 80s game and it's boring after the first movie poster. It's inferior to every movie it takes from. The episodes and show itself don't stand apart or have an individual strength. At heart its more 90s then 80s with the boring Dawson's Creek type love story. But Netflix are catering for the teen girl binge viewer. The characters are awful and interact on only simple terms. Like the kids always bicker because that's what kids do. They go on adventures on crap bikes because the Goonie did therefore all kids in the 80s.The grieving mom is crazy but in the end right because that's what happens to characters in generic shows. The cool outsider listens to The Smiths even though they're not even out yet (year out.) I wonder if he'll get the girl??? That would be a surprise. The cop is disillusioned and then by the most basic character development he eventually won't be. Every plot in this show as well as the dialogue is predictable. The show obviously has plans to run a long time because it's so stretched out and slow. Nothing happens and then at the end something will to fool you into watching the next one. Watched by people who want to be part of a trend. Did I mention it's 80s? Well that makes it good. Most people watching this weren't even born in the 80s yet seem to judge it's authenticity. Horror? What horror? And that character 11 or whatever her name is. She just plays the generic alien learning human ways. E.g Ways? What's. ..ways? Love? What's. ...love? Christ almighty this show is trash.",1
North America,"Stranger Things is highly overrated because it's boring,childish,empty and with a story already seen many times and full of clichés.The acting and directing is OK but predictable, being the Sheriff and Winona Ryder the best in my opinion, the visuals are good recreating the 80's and the special effects in the same level.About the 80's..it's not the 80's if the characters spend too much time making references to it.. (Lando....Lando...Lando...shut up..cliché fat-hat-kid with funny speaking.So,after the movie Super 8 making fun of the 80's (i kind of like the movie even if the name JJ_destroyer_of_Star_Wars_Abrams was there.)we have a 80's based show. The 80's are the new 2010's. Well,i love the 80's i was a kid full of dreams about the excellent movies and shows they created but when recreate them today, don't forget to make them unforgettable and full of magic but at the same time simple and full of heart as they were.And...PLEASE, somebody give Eggos to Nancy....",6
North America,"Perhaps my very low expectations are the reason I found this surprisingly good. It could have been a dreadful CGI-fest, but until the last episode the slick effects are kept to a minimum, and a lot is left to the imagination, which in my opinion makes for a more compelling experience. The acting is solid, and particularly the kids, which can make or break something like this, are not annoying, rather being well-cast and hitting the right balance. The plot is credible to an extent, but completely falls apart in the denouement, with manifold gaping holes in the last two episodes. However, how much plausibility can you really ask for in a show about monsters, telekinesis and ""the other side""? Considering this, I think it holds up quite well. All in all, this is a love letter to horror classics, and while references do not automatically equal quality, it has enough to please the buffs and those who simply want to watch something engaging and thrilling. A small gripe regarding references is that, for example, a scene almost completely ripped from Aliens which occurs in the last episode brought me out of the story and made me start thinking about Aliens, and the fact that Ryder had been in Alien 4, which is all rather distracting.",7
North America,"I am a 90s baby so I had yet to discover Winona Ryder and her awesomeness. Recently I watched a movie called Honeybee that I loved and it was inspired by Heathers which I then watched and I became obsessed! I started watching this show just for Winona Ryder and I loved her in it! I ended up loving everyone in this however, and I felt like I was watching the baby of ET and Heathers put together. The whole cast is so amazing and I can't get enough of the friendships with the kids. I can't say much more without including spoilers but I have a lot of hope for how they ended it, maybe its not quite so dark after all? I don't know but I do know I love Winona Ryder and discovering her and glad she made a comeback and I can't wait to watch the next season.",10
North America,"I heard about this series and really was looking forward to seeing it, but I was very disappointed.First of all, there's no way it gets as high a rating as it has without every Netflix employee going on and giving it a ten.IMDb is great, but it can't stop the fraud going on here.But back to the series. I watched all 8 episodes, hoping it would get better, but it only go worse.Now I know why Winona Ryder hasn't had many offers lately. She's a terrible actress. The whole time she has this facial expression like she's a deer in the headlights. It's very annoying to watch her pretend to be obsessed with finding her son.Actually, none of the characters were properly developed. None are likable, except maybe the sheriff.And as several others noted, this is a ripoff of every horror, scifi story ever written.Can't anyone come up with something original and well written?",1
North America,"Words can't describe how much I love this show. The characters experience tremendous growth throughout the series, and all of them are lovable in their own ways. I am anxiously awaiting the next season. This is by FAR Netflix's best series. It's a spectacular 80's-style series, and is captured just beautifully. Dustin, aka ""Toothless,"" Mike, and Eleven are definitely my favorite characters, although all of them are cool in their own ways. For whatever reason, this series is able to capture the 80's, ""kids on bikes"" vibe without any corniness at all. I am absolutely captivated by this show... I finished it in a matter of days! The next season can't come soon enough!!!!!!!!!",10
North America,"/refers to Season 1/In general, I am not into supernatural force dramas, particularly when the ""monsters"" are unaware of their wickedness, but after reading praising views and emanating from limited number (8) of episodes, I decided to give it a try... And became gradually contented.Well, the beginning was slow and the child characters reminded me the ones in e.g. Stand By Me, but the distinctive performance of Winona Ryder and the hints that ""earthly"" forces are also ""guilty"" made me to appreciate several nuances and scenes. Although being definitely the most famous performer, Mrs. Ryder did not steal the show, but was at best excelling herself as a fine team player. Most of the youth were bright-line as well and evidently not picked from model agencies based on ""cute"" looks.Besides, the series includes a good cinematography and creation of suitable atmosphere, with the events dating back to the 1980ies, to the days I was young myself, with all that music and outfit...Despite the pacing was uneven at times, and some scenes were protracted or did not provide additional value to the series, I would like to watch Season 2 when revealed. Some final scenes from Episode 8 excited my interest and let me ponder on and over how the next season could evolve - as many questions found their answer and events did find their closure.PS In fact, I liked Season 2 a bit more - due to enchanced sci-fi action.",8
North America,"It is great, but still a bit overrated. I think its rating is based less on its quality and more on nostalgia for the '80s that it brings. It pulls many elements from legendary shows and movies from the '80s and it's an obvious homage to Stephen King and movies like ""E.T."", ""It"", ""Golden Child"", ""Lost Boys"", etc. I'm not thrilled, but I am very satisfied. I enjoyed it and I'm very eager for the next season.8/10",8
North America,"Stranger Things was an absolute blast to watch. As we have come to expect from Netflix, the production side of things was spotless. The show is visually stunning, the score is compelling, and the performances are excellent across the board. However, the writing does suffer from an over-abundance of cliché. Of course, Stranger Things is, at its core, a callback to the classic monster movies of the 80s meaning that much of this cliché is not only forgivable, but even adds to the overall atmosphere of the show.My main problem with this is that the characters were only barely interesting enough to keep me invested in their stories. Again, much of this was intentional, but I feel that it was a bit overdone on the character side of things. We have all seen the alcoholic, loner, cop with a tragic past, the attractive, straight-laced young girl that yearns to break out of her shell despite the protestations of her more sensible friend, and the frustrated kid that sees what is going on, but is ignored by the adults so he takes things into his own hands. With all the other clichés - those of plot, visuals, and music - Netflix used them, but added a layer of production value that elevated them to the next level. However, with character, they are more-or-less tired old reruns of characters we have all seen a thousand times.That being said, Stranger Things is definitely worth the watch. For the most part, it rides the line between familiarity and mystery, and, for all my griping about the characters, I did care enough that I never lost interest in their fates. Were they complex and compelling? No. However, they were good enough. Besides, Stranger Things' calling card is not the writing or the characters. It is not a moving drama or a character study, it is a nostalgic revitalization of an out-dated genre. On this front, the show succeeds admirably. It will not challenge you, nor will it leave you with any lingering emotion, but it does provide 8 hours of some of the most beautiful, thrilling, and binge-able television in recent memory.",8
North America,"Stranger Things is really good. Every time I had watched an episode then I immediately wanted to watch the next episode. You get this feeling where you just needs to know what have happened.The actors really did a great job, and especially the children, you could really feel the mood they were in. When they were happy you were and when they were sad you were sad.I am giving it 9 out of 10 stars because i really enjoyed it but i am not giving it 10 stars because I thought there were some parts i really did not understand. It is not because it think it was some bad parts, but I just did not understand them.I can't wait to see how season two is going to be.",9
North America,"I cannot express how dam good this show is so I'm going to be very informal.At the beginning of the summer this year, my Facebook updates were jammed with constant articles and posts about the mysterious new show Stranger Things on Netflix. I at that point had not much interest, and now I want to beat myself up for that. Then just last Thursday I started o episode 1 of this so called ""Stranger Things"" and immediately as soon as it finished I was having leg cramps of excitement (seriously I did get leg cramps).Stranger Things follows the community of the town of Hawkins, who come together when a young boy Will Byers sinisterly disappears. While the local police carry out their investigation, paranormal and supernatural occurrences begin to haunt the town. We follow the adventures of: the three best fiends of the missing boy as they try to look for their lost pal, the brilliant performed hysterical mother by Winona Ryder, the curious girl who more than meets the eye, and the typical high school sub storyline, which is interesting than first considered.Created by the Duffer Brothers Stranger Things pulls together all 80s nostalgia and classic cinematic adventures such as Goonies, ET, Steven Spielberg, and Stephen King. You fell very familiar with what you see, but by the end you will be so mind blown from what you just witnessed. A very easy to watch show consisting of 8 episodes of 50 minutes, makes Stranger Things the most binge watchable show ever. Just an afternoon's work.The show is very creepy mostly ( the score is out of the is world literally), but has its sweet, funny moments as well, so has something for everyone. It has sub genre as a horror but not conventional sense.This is seriously a show worth watching, even if this is the one show you watch its definitely worth paying for. Stranger Things is a fantastic, traditional and original piece of perfect television ( the best out of the whole year I'd say). A must watch 10/10 OBVIOUSLY!",10
North America,"What's inside of a secret government lab located in Hawkins, Indiana may hold something far beyond comprehension. Consisting of a portal to a parallel world and a carnivorous demogorgon prowling for the next victim. ""Stranger things""-a sci-fi thriller, is about a young boy named Will that goes missing one night, and the courageous and adrenaline filled acts that are done to find him. The lead cast is fabulous and plays their part perfectly. I've personally never been a fan of sci-fi shows or movies, but ""stranger things"" has me hooked The idea of multiple dimensions and aliens has always intrigued me. Some people think the show is ""too slow."" The fact the writers could put a whole story consisting of as many things as it does, into an 8 episode season is really impressive and proves each and every episode is packed to a max with content you're looking for. The second complaint was ""the aliens and super human abilities are too much."" If you like sci-fi alien movies/miniseries that are: super good,suspenseful, and keeps you on your toes, then this is the one for you.",10
North America,"I got into this without knowing much about the story but only a sci-fi series. As step by step, you can enjoy the story in a mild pace, not fast and not too slow. The first two o three episodes create a tense atmosphere but as more things are revealed, puzzles are putting together. What surprised me was the performance by the main characters. The arguments among kids, the ignorance, ego, imagination and intelligent define what a pure friendship and brotherhood at the early age. As well as a more complicate teenage period by other main characters. Although I don't remember exactly how I would think in those years but I enjoyed the lines. However, like other drama, there are still some main things are not explained or fully explained. At this point, there are not enough clues for speculations. It would be interested to see how the story would continue. And hope that in the future, the story would not turn into another soap drama for teenagers' love story.",8
North America,"Where to begin.. I am usually not a big fan of sci-fi, fantasy or the period of time where this show takes place, but Jesus Crist was I pleasantly surprised! I was literally hooked after 10 minutes of this show and watched it all in one sitting. I wont go in to any plot details since I don't wanna risk spoiling even the smallest thing. But what I will do is say that I think this show is close to perfect in just about every way. It's a great and intriguing story, the tempo is perfect, the scenery is fantastic and the characters and acting is easily up there with the best I have ever seen in a movie or series combined. All the characters contribute to the story and I care about every single one of them. The writing is great as well.. It feels like every line and conversation moves the story forward in a well planned way which in my opinion is rare.There is definitely something for everyone in this show.. The mixture of sci-fi, horror, comedy and drama is really quite unique and I would think that it speaks just as well to a 15 year old girl as it did to me a 30 year old man.To sum this up I must give huge props to Netflix. You guys are simply awesome and you really struck gold with this show. I truly hope that season 2 will be just as impressive as the first one.. I will be patiently waiting and watching every other Netflix original in search for the next masterpiece in the meantime.",9
North America,"I RARELY post any kind of reviews for TV shows or movies, and to be honest, most of the time I start watching a new show, I am disappointed. However, after watching the first season of ""Stranger Things"" I am more impressed with this show than I have been with any other for a very long time. The acting is believable, the music is, well, perfect, and the plot is very engaging. And on top of that, there was no nudity and the language is for the most part clean, which I personally appreciate. And of course, being a child of the 80's (and this show being set in that era), the creators/directors really do nail it in regards to that. Can't wait for season 2 ... c'mon, hurry up July 2017!",10
North America,"From my output on TV series has always remained low because I do not watch TV series ever,but this was a Netflix series,so that's different,because they have all the episodes provided all in order. Anyway,I started watching the first episode and I was getting really interested,and I was like screw it,right? I'm going to watch the entire season(but that was also because I had nothing to watch). While I was watching it,it was like in the middle of the night,I was still wide awake,but usually when I stay awake during stuff I like,it just means I'm into it. I got through the entire season,I was impressed plus heart warmed too. I was actually not expecting a lot from this series. It most of all impressed me by how science fiction and scary it was,that was another reason why I watched it. But what also got me interested was that they added connections in the series to make it also a type of emotional series as well. When I watched this series,I was just expecting a lot from what I don't really care about series,which is long time get to the point type of stuff. Stranger things is a type of series that doesn't mess around,they get to the point and they just basically have everything I wasn't actually expecting out of this,and what I didn't expect is what I was impressed by. And that's what I loved about this series. It was scary,science fiction,and sad too.When I got done with the series,I just said can't wait for season 2,and I said it with a lot of meaning too. I really can't wait to see what happens next. In the mean time,I just continue to watch season 1 to keep me busy.",10
North America,"""Stranger Things"" is a very big surprise. After all, it's a made for Netflix series, so it's going to be cheap and suck...right?! Well, no...fortunately. Despite having mostly no-name actors and a modest budget, this show turned out to be a hit and one that promises to bring us more episodes. At the time I am writing this, the eighth episode has been aired and the series appears over...or so you think until the very end.So what is this show? Well, in many ways it's like some Steven King novels (particularly ""Firestarter""), the 1980s and ""Gravity Falls"" all mashed up into one really strange but fascinating show.The show begins with a child being lost into another dimension and his mother is naturally out of her mind with worry. But soon this sense of panic is felt by many in this small community. In the midst of this, a young girl, who is simply named '11' arrives in the town and is hidden by some middle school boys. They know she's being hunted...but what does she have to do with the disappearance as well as folks seeing monsters?! Well, watch this paranoid show and you'll see.So why was the show so effective and why are so many folks eagerly awaiting more episodes? Well, the writing is terrific and the direction really keeps you on the edge of your seats. The acting is also surprisingly good and overall the package is well worth seeing and will impress you. Far better than network television.",10
North America,"I'm not really into horror and I postponed watching this when I learned that it was set in the 80's, as I like modern series and films. But this is more mystery/thriller than scary and the whole 80s scene actually worked in its favour.I don't want to give anything away, as I believe that the less you know about a TV show or movie, especially a thriller, the more you'll enjoy it. I'll just add that there are children, teenagers, adults (thankfully) and their paths all interconnect to create a gripping story, with a mix of drama, suspense and even some humour. I was quite surprised to see that many episodes were written by different people, as they all pick up where the previous one left off. This is one series that it's easy to binge watch, I couldn't wait to see what would come next.Of course this isn't for everyone. It's sort of sci-fi but there is more fiction than science. But if it's entertainment you're after, this delivers.2022 June Update: I changed my rating from 9 to 7 after watching season four (until episode 7). I still think it's very good, but it feels like an introduction dragged over seven episodes and my favourite character didn't take a prominent role. Perhaps it's my taste that changed, or the pace has become a little too slow, making me wait too long for an interesting or good development.",7
North America,"SPOILERS AHEAD...I decided on watching this after my typical preview of the boring blah blah on Netflix. Netflix watchers rated it pretty high and I enjoy this creepy, weird genre.Decided to stream it via my BluRay box but the TV's cinema settings were a bit wonky so I watched S1 on my PC.Watching the pilot and the subsequent episode I recognized 2 names from previous movies; Winona Ryder and Matthew Modine. The rest of the cast were a bunch of newbies.The feel I got was 'what the hell am I watching? Stephen King? John Carpenter? Steven Spielberg? After S1E2 I started getting this bad headache. The splish-splosh of themes and mish mosh of various movie directions started to ring in my mind like a great bell.This bell rang until the very end. So what was Stranger Things? A huge extrapolation of various works by various directors and mushed into this TV series called ""Stranger Things"" - Aliens meets Hemlock Grove meets E.T. is this Stranger Things.Since there was nothing else on Netflix, I watched all of Season 1 in one sitting. Just to be objective. It really was meh.No wonder this is just on Netflix, it would never survive on its own.",5
North America,"When you're searching recommended movies and shows on your Netflix account, you'll find Stranger Things filed under the 'Sit Down and Binge-Watch This' category. Though in terms of genre, you can't put just one tag on it. Drawing inspiration from classics like The Goonies, The Breakfast Club, The X-Files and The Thing, the eight, hour-long episodes mix ingredients like the 80's high school coming-of-age, to the young, meddling kids adventure, to the supernatural lurking around every corner. Though what makes it stand out from any other time-period homage is incorporating several 80's flavors into one detail-driven thrill ride, making sure that certain qualities don't get overpowered from others (and we'll try to keep the spoilers back — you're gonna have to taste it for yourself).While the series' main drive is on the disappearance of twelve-year-old Will Byers, the story divides into several subplots in attempts to find him — and in doing so adds focus to the characters in their search. We see his closest friends: Mike, Dustin and Lucas joined by Eleven, a young, mysterious girl with a hidden past, Will's mom Joyce teamed with Chief of Police Hopper and the older siblings of Mike and Will, Nancy and Jonathan. Each story line peers into the lives both past and present, on relationships, grieving, love and betrayal. Each event experienced presently or in backstory ultimately plays a role how everyone got to where they are now, and all come together in the final climatic episodes.The fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana and the day-to-day living is another key ingredient in how the show plays out. While most of the residents live in the ordinary bubble of Hawkins, the main set of characters experience the supernatural occurrences that have recently (and relatively silently) plagued the town, brought on by unnatural experiments from Hawkins Laboratory, just outside of town. This tone-shift in the story is well-thought-out and unlike some of the shows and films that came before it, it doesn't fall back on every-other minute scares and doesn't get held back by relying on secondary scripting or unnecessary fluff. It's a natural, even fade in and out of light and dark, both in in dialogue and visual aspects.In past films and television set back in 1980's America, one can argue that their love for nostalgia in their movies that can overpower the viewer's palette. And if you still haven't logged in to Netflix to add it to your queue, you'll find Stranger Things holds nothing back when bringing up 80's culture — but doesn't make it obnoxious. Instead of completely dedicating the show to it, the show's design and look subtly flaunts culture unique to the day and time and occasionally dropping music and movie titles in the script, but all have their purpose and contribute to the making and telling of the story.When all of these aspects are rolled into one, 'Stranger Things' makes a nice, refreshing return to the past in more ways than one. The presence of classic, unforgettable 80's culture, the investment of young, raw talent along with some familiar faces from the era and the punctual, accurate telling of the story is an experience for whoever presses the play button. Each episode has an impact; people from every generation can have a genuine relation to what's playing out on the screen, where each flavor and taste comes in at the right moment, and doesn't settle for blandness.",9
North America,"What a truly enthralling decade the 80's was. I'm truthfully not that into the zeitgeist, but man, was it a paramount era to the history of pop culture. And lately it has been resurrected into much of a contemporary subculture. From Sing Street to the upcoming Ready Player One motion picture, from MGMT to The 1975, mom jeans, hipster glasses—'nostalgia', so say them all, even though for the younger generation, it's mostly an all new trend made out of quirkier, stranger things (pun intended). And none of them fulfills me with the same surge of childish glee The Duffer Brothers' brain child imposes upon me.Stranger Things is a show that captivates my dissipating appetite for jaw- dropping fascinations and strange discoveries. It energizes me with zeals. It has me remember many mood-boosting things: John Hughes movies, Stand By Me (this one, very much), Star Wars (""Lando Calrissian!""), Star Trek (Ryder is Spock's abramsverse mom, c'mon), River Phoenix (Charlie Heaton, anyone?), ET, mutants and superheroes, familiar adorkable geekery and young love.From my inadequate description, you'd think it's a rainbows-and-unicorns kinda thing. It's not. It's a fairly dark sci-fi/thriller. But it's also a lot of pleasant things. A coming-of-age story, a love story, sometimes and more than you know, a comic entertainment. I think it was created with so much passion and enthusiasm that we all get to pass that on.From the flawless soundtrack to the Emmy-worthy production, direction, and performances, I'm all in. I've never seen an ensemble of more talented kids. Millie Bobby Brown gives me the Natalie Portman vibes, the whole package, down to her well-known intelligence. Finn Wolfhard, Gaten Matarazzo, Caleb McLaughlin, Noah Schnapp; I'm so in love with these kids that I sound like a pedophile.The Duffers have openly attributed their inspirations to their beloved 80's childhood. They paid homage to the likes of The Clash and Spielberg and Stephen King, and received one hell of endorsements in return. And I'm telling you, hop on and ride the hype. 9/10.",9
North America,"like the younger generations are expecting a piece de la resistance. Spoiler...it's not, it's purposely flawed in just the right way. The fact you don't get that means this isn't something for you and that's OK. I lived through the 80s being a 40 something and this is spot on and is much better than those movies in writing, directing and acting. I view it as one of the best things to come out of Netflix another would be Sense 8. You cast your opinions, me I'm going to do the same and rave about this. In my eyes it is that good. My estimation based off some of these comments would hate on movies like Heathers, Weird Science, Aliens, Beetleguise and the like. Not their decade so they don't get it.",10
North America,"Stranger things was the first TV show that I have ever watched entirely. It is a great TV show furthermore it is a good suspense to have fun. The story goes with some boys playing game for 10 hours, when Will, one of the boys, go back to his house, he weirdly disappeared. His friends looked for him, when suddenly they found a girl with super powers. She was created by an experience, her name is Eleven and she looked so scared because a bad man are wanting her to continue with the experience. She helped them to understand how to found Will, his mother and the chief of the city found Will in a place called the upside world. I just think the last chapter could be better, but in general it was good. I've watched other TV show like Strangers things, Supernatural but with one difference. Stranger things was fantasy story while supernatural was more realistic about spirits. I'm waiting so enthusiastically for the second season of Strangers things. I expect the monster is stronger and worse. During the show, Will's mother had been done the alphabet on the wall and put same lights to communicate with Will. I remember when I was a child I use to play with one, we wrote the alphabet in a paper, take a pen, do question so that the pen move from letter to letter forming words or sentences.",8
North America,"The plot, the characters, the actors, the music... everything in this TV show is amazing. This is one of those series that you know will develop a sort of like cult following because of how well thought out it is and entertaining. I was so involved emotionally with the characters in a way that I have never been.This will be one of Netflix's most precious jewels. Strangers Things can be best described as fusion television at its best. You have intensive consuming drama, nail- biting thrills, terror and just the right touch of action for what decisively makes for a ten-star TV series.The talent of the writers is matched by the actors. Great job all around on the election process for this great team.",10

North America,"To start with, I would like to address another reviewer that speculated that all the rave reviews were written by articulate and insightful 12 & 13 year old's. He went on to say that no one over 14 would find Stranger Things intriguing enough to hold an adult's attention for more than 10 minutes. If that is the case, I am the world's oldest teenager. In the year this story takes place, I was 23 years old. So I will let you do the math.Of course, like so many who like to dis a show without watching the whole series, or even an entire episode, he wrote a review anyway. So I am compelled to ask, who really has the shorter attention span?I think the high IMDb rating is appropriate. After watching all 8 chapters of this story, that may yet to be over, I can say I was never bored. The acting was great and the Duffer Brother's took the time to build characters a viewer would care about. Eleven's ultimate fate seemed to be inevitable, but in science fiction, gone does not necessarily mean dead. She really was the hero of the story.My memories of 1983 are very clear, and the producers were very accurate on the dress, speech & music of the year. I so often see period pieces that use music or even fashion that would be off by a few years. So for myself, it was a nostalgic joyride.I only gave it 8 stars because the formula and plot are a patchwork of earlier shows & movies that I have seen over my many years watching Sci- Fi & horror. Having said that, I found it difficult to accurately predict what would happen next, so it kept me guessing and watching.I give Cu-do's to Netflix as I see original series that are far superior to any of the crap we get on regular TV these days. It is $12.00 a month that I never feel is a waste of money; and these days, that is a rare but wonderful thing.",8
North America,"This is very good if you like sci-fi. Maybe more suited to older nerds than younger ones who may not get the references I love the 80's vibe. Great music from the era. I was that age in 1983, oh how times have changed but this series did take me back to better(?) more innocent times. It reminds me of stuff like ET, Goonies and Wargames. No spoiler here but at one point I almost hoped they would do a scene from ET but the they chose to do something like the opening sequence to one of the Austin Powers movies. And playing games like the Hobbit on my ZX Spectrum with friends plugged into a black and white TV I bought with paper round money. Episode 8 is 10 out of 10. If you haven't seen it watch it during the Christmas holidays. The end sums up the festive period for me. HBO and Netflix make some great stuff.",10
North America,"This series is excellent.The acting, the atmosphere and the directing. A thriller/mystery without paper thin characters.But what blew me away was the homage to the late 70s, early 80s classics.Somehow they took the best from Poltergeist, It, The Thing, Close Encounters & a lot of other cult classics and packaged it into an awesome 80s setting with a creative twist. Modern, and not too corny. I found it downright charming at times.If you aren't a movie buff I think you'll enjoy it for what it is. If you are a movie buff, I think you'll find this series a treat!Also, the kids and the Sheriff in this gives some amazing performances.I don't really have too many gripes with this series. Don't expect a hack n' slash. It's a Thriller/mystery, and it's one of the best I've seen.Recommended!",9
North America,"By the end of the first episode was hooked. The acting capabilities of these kids was honestly amazing. I don't leave many reviews on things, sometimes if it was really bad or really good. This was honestly really good. The sci-fi part of it is super interesting and i loved how they showed the Upside Down just like how Will described it as ""Home but colder"", or something along those lines. At first yo will hate Steve, but near the end when he helps Jonathan and Nancy it shows a positive character development. I loved the person who played Eleven, he acting was amazing, considering she didn't talk much and she had to show her emotions through her facial features, which some actors find hard to do and stay quite plain. MY favorite character was probably Dustin, due to the humor he brings to the story and he is a real ice breaker when things get tough between Lucas and Mike. Mike and Eleven's little relationship is also super cute. The animations blew m mind as well, like when they were in the Upside Down and there were small spores flying everywhere (Which kind of reminded me of The Last Of Us) this series had a kind of 'Super 8' feeling to it, but personally i think it was much better. The story line was more in depth and the characters have a great development throughout the story. There aren't any bad jump scares in it, but it can get a little creepy a times, like when you can see the demogorgon in the photo, which you wouldn't have noticed before, or when you can see the face of the demogorgon trying to get through the wall. I think the implementation of the lights was also super cool, like they knew when someone was in the Upside Down when the lights flickered. I also loved how Mrs Byers kind of made a makeshift Ouija board on the wall, using paint to make the letters and Christmas lights to let will flicker which letter he wants to show. Awesome!Jonathan and Nancy's little coupley moments are also super cute.",10
North America,"This show has everything I do NOT want to have in a mystery show, from using every dumb audience-friendly scenario available, every foreseeable action maneuver used in the last thirty-some years, every cliché that falls into the agreed perspective of prepubescent kids, to nearly non-ending senseless quarrel of - again - prepubescent kids, to a hundred percent not frightening monster manifestations, to really not funny scenes and dialogues between said kids and adults, to a totally unimaginative solution and ending, to....well, I could rant about bad things here for a while, and because everyone is so excited about that show, nobody will notice. My review will simply drown in that unimaginable deep sea of epicures of mediocrity.I will not hide that I am not a lover of both S. Spielberg, whose way of storytelling was obviously a prototype here, and S. King, whose way of horror-telling was a prototype too, but of course I appreciate their greatest works, like 'Duel' and 'Shining'(by courtesy of Stanley Kubrick, of course).What they both have in common is their great nose for what the people want, which is equal to having a nose for making money.The producers of this show are obviously on the same wavelength like their models, thus landing a hit with something so flat and hollow that it evaporates immediately after watching, as opposed to provoke some thoughts at least.The script and story felt for me literally coming out of a construction kit for television hit producers, there was not one scene or one thing going on, that I hadn't seen before elsewhere.Normally I give disasters like this two or three stars here, but three stars are for the child actors, first of all, of course, Millie B. Brown. A rare talent, who manages to say everything with such few words, at her age, that is really remarkable, in a show which is otherwise completely unremarkable.",1
North America,"With Stranger Things Netflix had a big impact on me this year. I a very small time i become addicted to it. In the beginning I was not sure if this movie will win my attention, so I give her a chance that I don't regret. It certainly was the atmosphere that gets darker and darker around the series, the good technical implementation, as well as the acting that made me watching one episode after the other. The Story fells like its playing in 1983. Some of the movie-elements stick in the style of this time, which is creating a lot of charm and its used on purpose to create a specific mood.The first episodes creating the depth of the different characters. After this the series generate a need to keep watching the other episodes.For me Stranger Things is a mixture of the movies ""The Mist"" (2007), ""ET"" (1982) and ""Cloverfield"" (2008). I cannot describe the feeling why I select Cloverfield. Maybe it's the way this series feels. Cloverfield produced the same oppressive feeling in me.Technically Stranger Things has been developed on a very current state of the art. They surprised me with more complex computer-generated effects, as well as environments and objects. Light is used consciously to transfer mood and tension. I liked very much how the creators of the series could tie me up with this mood.",9
North America,"When I saw Stranger Things had a really high score rating, my expectations were raised. Considering this show had many positive reviews, I assumed there would be something outstanding in this show, or some sort of mind-blowing component. I was disappointed. This show barely lived up to my expectations, and it just came off as a rushed, poorly directed alien monster show. There were no wow-factors or anything that took me breath away. Everything was predictable, and they did not leave much up to the viewers to figure out. This, of course, is my personal opinion. One man's trash is another man's treasure. In this case, it was trash.",6
North America,"And the reason for a higher rating is people actually like it. It's OK for people to like something you don't even if you don't understand why. That's actually OK. The rating apparently used to be higher and would be higher than it is if it weren't for all those killjoys whingeing and whining. If it doesn't meet your high expectations don't watch it.I'm rating this 10 to bring the score back up as it rightfully deserves the high rating as one of the most unique celebrations of 80s nostalgia. So what if some people don't care for it, this isn't made for you. Sorry about that. I also enjoyed it as much, as I did Boardwalk Empire and Daredevil. Why do we watch TV shows? Because we enjoy the story. If you don't enjoy it where half to most other people do is that your fault or the creators? I'll leave readers to answer that themselves.I've been revisiting a lot of 80s movies in 2016 and someone told me about Stranger Things - I held off watching it until December and held back from binging the short series to prolong the suspense, even watching a couple of the episodes twice in a row. Far from perfect but I'm very impressed with the ambiance and vibe and pacing. What an accomplishment. So what if it has mundane parts. So what if it has filler, it's stylish. Whatever flaws are present, and I'm sure there are tons (many of which have been articulated comprehensively by indignant IMDb haters), are more or less invisible to this viewer perhaps due to an 80s bias (I grew up in the 80s being born in 1979 - etch-a-sketch, chopper bikes, Garbage Pail kids etc despite being British of course I embraced the indulgent romanticism of 80s American coming-of-age movies) HOWEVER - I'm not a great fan of 80s horror and sci fi (with a few exceptions) and I can't really stand SPIELburg's overly-sentimental and crass contributions to cinema especially ET and Close Encounters. I do respect the work of Stephen King though prefer his dramas to the horror. Despite or maybe because of all this I instantly recognised and enjoyed the parallels between this TV show and 80s titles which the creators were very deliberately and conspicuously paying homage - Stand By Me, The Goonies, Alien, Scanners, the list goes on and on (there are several blogs and entertainment sites listing the titles as well as recommendations for other post-80s films and other more recent releases). Thus the intention of this series is not to be original, as expressed in the polemic of some of the haters, but the intention is specifically NOT TO BE original. In this way the Duffer brothers have tapped into a whole generation with fond memories of retro technology and a time when such technology was in its infancy and entertainment was less cynical and the world in general seemed simpler as we were less connected and consequently more ignorant than we are post-millennium. After all ignorance is bliss.You'll notice I've not really mentioned anything about the content of the show. I'm assuming you've seen it already but if not - check it out and make your own decision. I noticed that the majority of 1 and 2 star reviews (some of them admitting that they would review it 6/10 but they deliberately rated it down to lower the mean rating - which is a cretinous thing to do) the majority of those reviewers it appears had seen the rating, or heard people saying how great it was and so then had the highest expectations - but for some reason these expectations weren't met. Personally I didn't know anything about it at all before I watched it except that it had something to do with the 80s, didn't read any reviews and wasn't aware of IMDb or any other ratings - and I enjoyed it. As a fan of comedy and fantasy but not so much of scifi horror, this show perfectly filtered and watered down vintage horror and added a watertight cast, 80s kids movies nostalgia and topped it off with a lovely ambient synth soundtrack.So this review is for the haters. This show is not perfect but it is entirely comprised of elements that some audiences, myself included, have wanted to see for a very long time. Keep on hating, I'm waiting keenly for season 2 and if it disappoints, so what? It's not even that important! The important thing is that for whatever reasons for the Duffer Brothers, whether they wrote it or not (whereby as they didn't write it according to IMDb reviewer bradcheng; ""their auteur status goes down the drain""), this is a labour of love - demonstrated by it being rejected fifteen times before Netflix - and their love for the material shows in the work, whether it makes sense to some viewers or not, if viewers have the imagination to enact, in the words of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, willing suspension of disbelief (a term which was coined in the discussion of texts like this, involving the supernatural). Like Peter Jackson the Duffers are unabashedly invested in their subject matter and though might not be pioneers of horror/fantasy/scifi they worked hard to realise their vision regardless of whether audiences think they were successful or not. Some audiences like these works - some don't. If you don't, I'm sorry for you, that you don't get it, that you didn't enjoy it. At he end of the day this TV show will quickly and quite rightfully become an instant cult classic, in the words of another historical Englishman ""warts and all"".EDIT
It got worse as it went along so I changed my rating from 10 to 6 but the characters are still interesting, some of the acting became a bit hammy but kinds works of course.I won't get into the esoteric or occult aspects of the show for there are many.",6
North America,"After noticing such high ratings and everyone losing their minds over this show, I gave it a try. Ever since the first episode I still have no idea why there was such an upheaval around this series.Let's break it down to the main components of the show.1) The acting was not so good. The kids were cringeworthy sometimes and, aside from the sheriff and maybe will's mom, the acting was as good as it would be in any one the 1000000 indie series we will never get to hear about.2) The story is really not that original. I mean, it's basically a generic horror movie plot. The D'n'D part was kinda cringeworthy too. It seemed to me like a classic show to kids or pre-teens, where adults are evil (DoE), and the kids are the ""chosen ones"" that will defeat the evil. The whole ""our universe is like one side of a coin"" thing is really old, and it's appeared in so many series that I've lost count.3) The music was good. That was the component I liked the most. The whole soundtrack really captures the essence of the 80s shows, which I think was the goal of the composer.All and all, it's a good show, but it's nothing compared to 9/10 shows here on IMDb, such as Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad or Sherlock (though Sunday's episode was kinda meh).Oh, and as a suggestion, The OA has kind of the same vibe as Stranger Things, but it's waaaaay better. That's a show that deserved at least an 8.5/10. But I guess timing/marketing is everything. Stranger Things arrived in the summer, when kids are out of school and ready to binge watch and hype a lot of shows.",6
North America,"I loved this, and can't wait to see season two. It has a brilliant and gripping story line, well told and well acted by a fantastic cast. It took me right back to the 80's films, and i saw nods to many films i watched back then.Millie Brown is an exceptional young actress, she made me believe she was Eleven, the test subject with super powers, i know we will be seeing a lot of her in the future and rightly so, she was perfect for this part.I was also very impressed with the filming of this show, with so many spooky movies etc having everything done in too dark a setting so you can't tell what is going on, this did not happen here.The lighting was perfect, moody and atmospheric and beautiful at times, it was a pleasure to watch.I simply can't think of anything bad to say about this, please, lots more series!!!",10
North America,"Stranger Things came with a lot of hype that I had a hard time believing. A science fiction show with Winona Ryder as an unstable mother to a boy gone missing under very suspicious circumstances. Netflix hit this one out of the park. They took a piece of a bunch of the best movies (science fiction and otherwise) and threw pieces of them in adding a fairly complex plot as to how scientists accidentally ripped a whole between parallel universes and didn't know how to deal with it. They did a great job of having basically three groups (friends of the kid who went missing, older sister of one of the friends and older brother of boy who went missing, and the mom and sheriff) all working independently to start but with each episode coalescing into a single group fighting the government agency that screwed things up to begin with and the beast from the parallel universe that had stolen the boy (and others). The writing is excellent as they make it build such that it is one of those shows you start to stream and find you can't stop until it is over. Thrilled to see season 2. They did a great job of bringing closure to the first seasons story with a happy ending, but planting just enough seeds that it leaves little doubt there is room for incredible expansion of the story in seasons to come. Netflix is doing a great job with their own productions, but this one stands out to be a potential SciFi classic. Even Breaking Bad didn't leave me this enthused after one season and that is my favorite show of all time.",10
North America,"That's the problem with T.V. shows today and this show is one of the problems when it's going to end. In my opinion I'm tired of seeing the same laziness in shows like Stranger Things, Daredevil, Jessica Jones they all just guilty pleasure with no fresh ideas. And Neflix it's starting to become the huge problem of people laziness in finding anything to watch because they bored until the next new thing. Stranger Things is not an enjoyable show for the mind same thing could be said with Mr.Robot it's just guilty pleasure like Pretty Little Liars, Vampire Diaries, and The Walking Dead where they just going to keep dragging out the story until it doesn't make sense anymore. I have to stop this show before I get suck into another show with no entertaining enjoyment where I can relax and enjoy. Stranger Things is another stable show like Mr. Robot until something new comes long nothing is refreshing and no re watchable value like The Fresh Prince Bel- Air,Friends, Cartoon shows, some daytime sitcoms where you can relax and enjoy it over and over until it's call your favorite show you grown up watching where is the excitement in the show; I already been there and seen it before when I was a child. There's no need to go through with this again. A step back to child/Adult memory Stranger Things is nothing new it copies and paste from other classic movies and t.v. shows; it's getting boring find something refreshing you can enjoy to relax your mind, because this is another guilty pleasure 1/10 for this laziness. I will hold my options open until someone create something new and refreshing to call my favorite.",1
North America,"Nice core story and cool recreation of the 80's environment. Too bad that this includes ripping off many elements from popular films of that time: the series is a combination of ""E.T."", ""Alien,"" ""Signs"" and ""Close Encounters..."" Doesn't anybody have an original idea for a series anymore?And the dialogues are sooo laaame!! As if they were written by the three children who are the main characters. That's a pity, because they really get in the way of enjoying the show. There are so many clichés that this also becomes irritating... How many times can you get away with characters keeping stupid secrets from each other, when there is no need to do that? How many times can characters just say ""trust me on this..."" instead of explaining why they want people to do something?And how come in the parallel universe you have the same buildings, except with weed growing all over them? Why is it always night there? Why are there no people (except a poorly-dressed monster), yet there are lampposts on the streets, but no lights inside buildings?Well, if you're 8 years old, I guess you're not bothered by any of this.",4
North America,"Stranger Things is not only Netflix's best till date but it is a tribute to the glorious 80s and one of the greatest series of this decade which will surely leave a huge impact on society.It's simply Steven Spielberg meets Stephen King. Everyone who is fan of Stephen works and movies like E.T. , Alien , jaws , Stand by me , the goonies , close encounters of third kind and many more will instantly develop a crush to it. First of all Duffer brothers captured the right nostalgia with their superb writing. Today every series try to run for higher audience and critical remarks. Stranger things not only success in these both but also leaves a major crush on it. The Characters are extremely lovable, the story , the twist , environment , atmosphere , story and all the elements including the horror factor makes it a unique tribute and a sort of remake which clearly stands out crystal clear from a crowd of bad remakes and sequels. Not only relating to films the story has both excitement and emotional facts at it center. Each character is immediately a classic whether it be Eleven , Barb or Dustin . The little hints that it contains and all those scenes that reminds us of the very famous films of late 70s and 80s are so so so so so good. To be Simply put there are many many series in Hollywood that are critically acclaimed and loved by audiences but very few have the rare factor that makes them stand out from the crowd to finish at the top and stranger things is one of them . no wonder why both Steven and Stephen are its huge fan.Also all the actors have done a great job which adds to the quality. All I can say is STRANGER THINGS IS DESTINED TO BE HAILED AS A CLASSIC",10
North America,"There's not much one can say about this series other than that it's made for true fans of this genre. If you like the 80s, Stephen King novels, Dungeons and Dragons, are a little geeky and have a good imagination then you'll love it. A small, non-descript town is the perfect backdrop for this story. A group of adolescent boys uncover a mystery surrounding a young girl with super powers who has been part of an experiment to reach another dimension (as you do). The girl is played brilliantly by Millie Bobby Brown who has an emotional depth I've never seen in a child actor before. The story is beautifully told and is entwined with themes of friendship, the importance of family, effects of loss, a mother's love and the drive of friends to live out their fantasies and adventures together. Apparently the Duffers brothers have an affinity for Stephen King and I loved the homages to his novels throughout – I almost felt like it could have been based on one of his books. This series is like comfort food for the soul. I've watched it twice already and think I still have a third viewing in me.",10
North America,"This is definitely a trippy series yet managed to suck me in just like the upside down place!The premise is a bunch of neighbourhood kids doing what you'd expect-riding bikes, playing games, sorting out the ups and downs of suburban life.The adults are going about their business in surreal yet predictable ways.Then one of the kids disappear and all heck breaks loose. Each episode gets stranger and stranger (hence the title) yet works in a weird old school horror flick sort of way.While the premise seems over the top, the writing is on point leading viewers down a fantastic sci-fi path that is refreshing, campy and entertaining. Each episode has an enjoyable 80s tempo.It's a fun series to watch and the acting is great.Winona Ryder plays her role with finesse and gusto as a nervous Nelly single Mom relentless in her pursuit to find her missing son.The closing scenes give us a happy ending where everything is back to normal and then suddenly in the blink of an eye we realize it's not.This well crafted final episode leaves us all waiting in anticipation for season two.Well done Netflix!",8
North America,"The Goonies is just about my favourite movie and Stranger Things recaptures all that excitement of nostalgic adventures and kids believing that life is one big adventure. It's like Stephen King has thrown a dark spin on all the movies I watched growing up. I binge-watched Series One on Netflix and literally couldn't stop. It was exciting, scary, brilliant performances all around and superb design from all departments. I'm not really a fan of sci-fi but there was something about this which immediately grabbed me and made me compelled to keep watching, I think because it sits so well in the 80's. I'd highly recommend Stranger Things to anyone that appreciates stellar performances, particularly from the children, some mystery, intrigue and a nostalgic trip back in time. The soundtrack, production design totally transported me back in time. It makes me want to get a group of friends together, go off to the woods on our bikes and plot how to save the world. Brilliant, brilliant TV.",10
North America,"""You shut up!"" ""No! You shut up!""Above is just one of the amazing lines of dialog you will hear in stranger things - over and over and over and over again. And Winona's winy voice while she screams every line? It makes you jump to turn the volume down! The dialog in this show is often painfully annoying, only equaled by the screaming deliveries. And it is constant! The grating nature of how the characters scream at each other does not let up for the entire season.Screeching aside, Stranger Things is obviously well produced. Everything came together in terms of look, effects and sound - there is a very consistent style that works perfectly for a show with this science fiction/horror theme. It doesn't take long to discover that budget and (nuts and bolts) filmmaking are huge upsides to this show. The producers should be (and I'm sure are) really happy with their creation.And what is Stranger Things? I'd call it a hybrid science fiction/horror tale involving several families from a small American town, with special focus on the kids. The kids are the main characters, and the viewers become involved in their epic adventure. Stranger Things borrows and steals ideas form other film makers and writers, with generally a 1980's feel. There are a lot of interesting ideas ranging from weird science to mental powers to horrific monsters from bizarre alternate realities. Interestingly though - none of it feels fresh - because every idea is a lift from another source.I admit I was pretty excited for this show based upon the premise, but my anticipation was quickly squashed in the first two episodes. I love homage, borrowing - even outright stealing of ideas if they build into something better than the original. But when ideas are taken and squandered, it's just frustrating.I'm not talking about the obvious Carpenter, Spielberg or King lifts - all of which were done (imo) with class. The Carpenter'esque title design, music is excellent. The King horror ideas work pretty well! Most of the Spielberg stuff would be lifts from Poltergeist, and his skill at directing kids - which, again, is pretty slick in how the ideas are merged.But this gets to my gripe - which is very specific - This is the second time Dan Simmons' Summer of Night has been blatantly ripped off - and not in a way that does any justice to this amazingly entertaining book. The first time this book was ripped off was JJ's Super 8 (yea... starting to get more convincing, eh?) - a movie that clearly shares a lot of the same qualities as Stranger Things. Dan Simmons is a brilliant writer, and while Summer of Night is far from his greatest book, it is a very special book to him. The book has a real personal touch, the kids are so believable and captivating, and their trials... to see the blatant lifts, right down to specific character details and story events... it's frustrating!so... my ax is super sharp due to all the grinding - if you like this show, I strongly recommend reading Simmons' Summer of Night.this show? Annoying well made rip off? 6 out of 10",6
North America,"There were some very nice aspects of Stranger Things. Personally, I was watching it for the sci-fi angle. It was more of an X-Files/Goonies/Beverly Hills 90210. The X-Files/Firestarter likeness was cool. Even the Goonies/E.T. type style was OK. The Beverly Hills 90210 teenage drama was sickening. I don't care who likes who, who's sleeping with who or who a sweet young girl is going to lose her virginity to. That very unnecessary aspect of the show very nearly ruined it.Well, that and Winona Ryder--she was awful. I couldn't take the show seriously whenever they put her exaggerated mug on the screen. Goodness, she was such a caricature. I didn't know if she was going for comedy, crazy or an Oscar. She greatly overplayed the distressed-I'm-not-crazy mother role. She was terrible.Strip away the teen love component and Winona Ryder then this was a solid sci-fi series. It's 1983 and a young kid named Will Byers (Noah Schnapp) goes missing. The mom, Joyce Byers (Winona Ryder) is convinced that he's alive and nearby. Coupled with that strange disappearance a young girl named Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) shows up and is able to do some real Professor X-type stuff.The show centers around four distinct characters: Mike Wheeler (Finn Wolfhard), young nerd and leader of his pack. Joyce Byers, distressed mother. Jim Hopper (David Harbour), town sheriff and relentless searcher. Nancy Wheeler (Natalia Dyer), confused teenager in love looking for her friend. As I stated before; two of the characters' stories I couldn't care less about and the other two were the meat and potatoes for me. More bizarre happenings and less soap opera drama and it is a lot better show.",7
North America,"***Contains Spoilers***Stranger Things is filled with everything you could want in a thriller. You've got the lovable goofball, the damsel in distress, the strong independent woman who don't need no man, the young love, a missing red-head, and of course Winona Ryder. So if you haven't seen it, definitely put aside like 8-10 hours and get on that.Set in the early 1980's, the show should bring back some nostalgia for those old enough to have been around during that time. Playing on the belief (and recent confirmation) of government funded experiments by the American's, Stranger Things does an excellent job of piecing together a thriller through eight Chapters, also known as episodes, which take you through the story of a sleepy town in Indiana. Leading to startling discoveries that if you weren't a child younger than 12, you wouldn't have believed it until you saw it.Even though science fiction TV has been extremely popular in the past, (i.e. Doctor Who, Star-Trek, etc.), I have always found it took me a season or two to really get into the story lines. Creating suspense through it's use of fictional horror and the classic dark rooms and night-time scenes, Stranger Things will definitely have you leaving the light on as you go bed for those with a softer disposition.The toothless wonder, Dustin Henderson, by far my favourite character with his perfectly timed dry wit and adorably cute smile. Played exquisitely by Gaten Matarazzo, he actually has no front teeth in real life, meaning his condition, cleidocranial dysplasia, was written into the show just for him. Why we haven't heard of him before is a mystery to me, fingers crossed we'll see him more often in the future, with or without teeth.Which brings me to my second favourite character. Even though she's really only in the first two episodes and we don't get to know her a lot, it does confuse me as to why she kept crossing my mind throughout the rest of the season...oh that's right, because no one was looking for her!!!Why was no one looking for Barb? I mean yes, the government looking officials planted her car at the bus stop to make it seem like it she had run away, but let's be just a tiny bit logical here. We have a Sheriff, with his own sad backstory, going out of his way, like seriously out of his way, to find the answer behind a little boy, Will's, disappearance. So why don't we see the same enthusiastic investigating for Barb's disappearance? Should I be going down a whole feministic, equality, gender double standards rant route here? Should we be looking at the clearly confusing parenting going on by Barb's parents? Why Was No One Looking For Barb? That question will forever haunt me, more so than the monster that comes out of walls in the dark.At least one person was looking for barb, and also stuck in a tricky love triangle at the same time. Nancy's got some game, I won't deny her that. Set-up to be the smart, pretty, shy girl, with her cape-less wonder side-kick, Missing Barb, by her side, Nancy appears to turn to the dark side, Anakin Skywalker style eventually finding her way back in order to help Will's older brother, Jonathan, find Will from the Shadow Realm. Oh, that's brand new information for you? Seriously dude, you need to watch it!!!Even though Nancy's story-line, goes up, down and all around, I am slightly disappointed with who she ends up with at the end. Yes, Steve turned out to be a big-haired jerk at the beginning but he did help defeat the monster in the end AND lets not forget he told his even jerkier friends to bugger off. I mean, he's certainly no Jonathan, who only believed you when you said that Barb had been taken, and not run away, by the monster that took Will that everyone else in the town was saying didn't exist. Nice work. You did good.Finally we come to Winona Ryder, portraying a desperate mother, that can, at times, be slightly annoying, but we forgive her because she's a desperate mother. She didn't even need to steal our hearts, because seeing her desperation and commitment to getting her son back, especially when she hear's his voice, makes you just want to lend her your heart. (See what I did there?)All in all, Stranger Things is a fantastic watch, thrilling right to the end scene and providing revelations that just make your hair stand on end. It even got me thinking a couple times throughout the season if things like this actually do happen and the cover up is just that good. I suppose we'll never know. It seems we all just need to wait for that day when we're called up from sitting at home on the couch watching TV and find it's our time to save the world from a terrifying monster that somehow manages to go unnoticed despite being massive, ugly and killing numerous people. Yep, that's the day we're all waiting for.With the Season Two trailer released earlier in the week, we can only hope that it lives up to its older brother and the hype that, probably won't be as big as Game of Thrones, but will no doubt be there just the same.",9
North America,"I'm in my early 40's and this series paid homage to 'literally' most of my top 20 movies from the 80's.It wasn't perfect, but it was dripping with so much awesome nostalgia I didn't care. It's also perfect for kids aged around 10 to 14 who love movies , and especially older movies. Well to that age group the 80's is old movies. Whereas Super 8 for example was made for a target audience of kids only important.I loved the cast as almost every character outshone themselves, watch this space for a least a couple of future mega stars!This series was great fun, especially to the age groups I've mentioned above.9 out of 10 from me, can't wait for the 2nd season.ETA - I started episode 2 at midnight, and just finished episode 8 now (7am).I'm so tired I'm borderline delirious @_@",7
North America,"I rarely give a perfect 10 for films; out of 715 films I have seen and rated so far in my life (as of February 2017), I have only given a perfect 10 to 25 films--only around 3.5% of the films I have seen. Usually a perfect 10 film tends to be unique, innovative, groundbreaking, pushes the filmmaking artistry to a new level, or touches me personally. This film doesn't really meet such criteria but I gave it a 10 anyway.Sometimes you run across a film or television series that doesn't really push the boundaries but melds all the different elements nicely to produce a perfect film. This is one such television series. I just love how the filmmakers--Duffer brothers--got all the different elements, including acting, a mysterious plot, humour/character interaction, and style to work together seamlessly.If you like a family-oriented (not safe for little kids but main characters are kids and teenagers) series that realistically portrays relationships between parents and kids, while also dealing with a mysterious story, you will probably like this series. I think the acting by the large cast was excellent--not everyone was perfect but overall, the kids, teenagers, and adults acted very well together.The plot is probably the weakest part of the film. Some of it was kind of clichéd and predictable, with some minor parts seeming a bit unrealistic. I think the creators could have made it a bit more darker and unpredictable but I think they wanted to maintain the feel-good vibe, typical of the 80's. I think the careful attention paid to the style of the series, which is a homage to the retro 80s, makes up for the plot shortcomings.Overall, I highly recommend this series to everyone. The plot is a bit predictable so hardcore horror/mystery or art film fans won't like it that much. But I think the family interactions and the 80's style makes up for its shortcomings and rarely is there a film or series that is well made and appealing to a wide audience.",10
North America,"The Duffer Brothers have obviously learned their lessons well, delivering an engaging and highly entertaining first season in a somewhat overwrought genre.The usual shortcomings inherent to mystery-drama-thriller-science fiction, predictability and plausibility, are managed quite well here and generally overcome by stellar performances all around, (Winona Ryder and Millie Bobby Brown are standouts), big budget production values, and a storyline that never veers too far off target. Up to date Grimm fans might be scratching their heads a bit once The Monster is fully revealed, (Isn't that an Alp?), but that doesn't detract from the overall quality or enjoyability of Stranger Things. The real test for the Duffer Brothers will be season 2, when such inherent shortcomings can be more acute and difficult to manage. Especially when the first go around is so successful. Expectations will be high.",9
North America,"Having heard great things about this show, I decided to finally watch it. I have to say that I'm super happy with my decision! It is best to go into this show not knowing too much about it.The show begins with a fantastic first episode, leaving you wanting to know more and making you wonder what the heck is actually going on. The season continues with a lot of suspense and mystery, giving off a science-fiction kind of vibe with a touch of conspiracy.Not only is the story itself super interesting but the characters are actually pretty interesting as well. This is a show where you really do care about the characters (especially the group of young cast members). I also really like the time period that the show is set in. I find it adds to the show's appeal.Overall, the first season of this show is great! Definitely worth watching! I only hope that season 2 will be just as good.",10
North America,"honestly didn't hear anything about this show and just decided to watch it on Netflix as something new and i fell in love with the series, the story is a new take on a lot of older tales but done in the most intriguing way, the cast (while some were unknown before this) are all absolutely fantastic, the characters are human, interesting and actually have a believable quality which makes you root for them all the way, the quality, sets, soundtrack, acting... everything just fits together like a puzzle perfectly showcasing this awesome story, i cant wait for more i have binge watched the 8 episodes twice over and i never once wanted to stop, amazing show, amazing cast and i hope that if you haven't given it a watch try it! it may just blow you away and if not then i hope you find something that gives you as much joy as this show gives me",10
North America,"**I do not want to spoil this series for anyone so I've tried to keep spoilers out of this review.**I finished watching this series within two days. As it has been stated in many reviews this series is a love letter to 1980's Sci-fi and I believe taken inspiration from the director Spielberg and many of his movies. The series brings out the curiosity in the actors minds by allowing them follow conspiracies backed by scientific theories. The audience is drawn in as the series follows a linear approach to its story very easy to follow how ever the Duffer Brothers do know how to build tension without giving much away. The children's acting are second to none, they take the audience on this incredible journey taking you right back to 1980. Anyone who enjoys Sci-fi will appreciate Netflix's monster Mystery Stranger Things.",9
North America,"Stranger Things, with no doubt was one of the best series of the last year, taking us to a different environment, and creating that atmosphere that. For other side, the history is a little predictable, and the end is very expected , but it was really good how the characters and the mystery coexist.",7
North America,"When my best friend told me to watch this, I said - grudgingly - ""I'll give it one episode."" He asked to PLEASE watch 2. Grumble, grumble, grumble. (I'm old: I'm ALLOWED to grumble. You aren't. Not unless you're closing in on 70, too.) Well, the first episode caught me within 10 minutes: a group of boys playing the equivalent of Dungeons and Dragons. They go home, and one boy disappears. Not so unusual so far. But then, it switches to a government lab (natch: located only a couple of miles from the town) and a scientist is running for his life. But who - or what - is he running from? Winona Ryder - barely recognizable - is the mother of two boys, one of whom is part of a group of the 4 boys who are drawn into this mystery when someone shows up at their door. If you want to know more - WATCH IT YOURSELF! The storyline expands so smoothly, the episode is over before you know it. Thats due to excellent - and unforced - scriptwriting that pulls you along. Ryder's unhinged (she was a mental case, as they say, at one point) persona is contrasted by the innocence and completely goodhearted quartet of boys - PLUS ONE. The town sheriff is actually a smart guy, instead of the stereotype of the dumb hick sheriff one frequently sees. And of course, there's the Big, Bad Government who will stop at nothing to locate the ""PLUS ONE."" Just watch it. You will either love it (meaning, if you like good science fiction, it'll grab ya) or you won't, which means you've been watching CW so much, you think that shows like....well, nearly anything on that network, are actually good scriptwriting. Pity if you do. I watched the first two episodes and it's fair to say that, by the time I'd ended the first episode, I thought, ""Well, I can bear to watch the second episode."" And that was my last conscious thought until I found myself bearing down on the end of episode 8. And then it was over and I found myself annoyed because there were no more episodes.",9
North America,"About Stranger Things, I looked forward to this series. But as my rating suggests, it did not deliver.First let me say I am no longer young. Second, I am not so old that I need a film to be explained to me. But I simply did not understand much of what was going on in the final three episodes.More important however was that the characters never seemed to act like real people. Particularly the adults. Case in point, one mother and father in the series never go into their son's room - not once. If they had they'd have discovered with whom he'd been sharing that space and well, that would ruin the story. So, I understand the 'why', but I think it could have been handled lots better.As for the kids' acting; really terrible.Finally, if there was one more scene of the kids jumping onto their bikes I would have screamed. In fact, I did.",1
North America,"Sarcastic title, having finished season 1 a couple of days prior & looking forward to season 2.A great cast, good script & OK visual effects supported by good lighting, this show is a fun throwback to all Things 80's (You see what I did there?)& even part 70's (notice the Jaws' style police uniforms & vehicles). Swiftly combined elements of several film genres & music make for solid entertainment that proves - along with shows like Westworld - series are better then a lot of films that come out these days.There are quite some opinions that state season 1 wraps everything up ambigiously, but not necessarily needs to lead into a 2nd season. I'm rather glad it flows into season 2, which I read was always the intention.Stranger Things is worth the views, check it out!",8
North America,"Watched Stranger Things Featuring Millie Bobby Brown(Intruders) as Eleven ""El"", Finn Wolfhard(Supernatural) as Mike Wheeler, Gaten Matarazzo(The Blacklist) as Dustin Henderson , Caleb McLaughlin(Blue Bloods) as Lucas Sinclair,Natalia Dyer(The Greening Of Whitney Brown) as Nancy Wheeler.Charlie Heaton(Shut In) as Jonathan Byers , Noah Schnapp(Bridge Of Spies) as Jonathan Byers,Cara Buono(The Sorpranos) as Karen Wheeler ,David Harbour(The Equalizer) as Jim Hopper,Matthew Modine(The Dark Knight Rises) as Dr.Martin Brenner, Joe Keery(Chicago Fire) as Steve Harrington, Sadie Sink() as Max,Dacre Montgomery(Safe Neighborhood) as Billy and Winona Ryder(Star Trek,Black Swan) as Joyce Byers.A Little late to the party But I really enjoyed Stranger Things A bit of Slow start and Nancy Wheeler's Romantic subplot drags the series for a bit but also really enjoyed it, its a more Creepier version of Super 8 also really enjoyed the Characters .great Score By Newcomers Kyle Dixon & Michael Stein ,Showrunner(s) Matt & Ross Duffer(Hidden),A More Creepier Version Of Super 8 9/10",9
North America,"The strangest thing about this show is the fact that it is such a huge success. It is presented as an ""original"" series, but there's not a single character or situation in it that you haven's seen dozen times in other movies or TV shows before - just check the IMDb trivia and you will see what I mean. Conspiracy theory? Check. Government cover-up? Check. Alien/extra-dimensional monsters? Check. Shy and sensitive boy falling for the popular girl who dates a fool? Check. Worn-out cop who gets a new break? Check. You name it - if it is a cliché, you will find it here. The cast is OK. Millie Bobby Brown is great and the other kids are good, but Matthew Modine looks uncomfortable as a villain whose voice we barely hear. This show has the undeniable virtue of being addictive and you can easily binge- watch it on a single free day, but then you ask yourself: ""So what?"" I had fun, but I as bored at some points and didn't feel like I had watched a great show like the Marvel and DC pieces I've been going through these days.",5
North America,"Overall, I liked Stranger Things more than I didn't, but I think that the show is overrated.Pros:Like the summary says, the storyline is creative and enjoyable for the most part. The main reason for why I stuck around till the end is because I wanted to know what will happen after each episode. The setting is nice, with the eighties recreated really well. The soundtrack is great, and it works really effectively with the setting. MOST of the characters were well written and acted (note that I said ""most."") Jim Hopper and Will's mother stood out as being especially good.Cons:The show is full of wince inducing clichés. From painfully unrealistic bully clichés, to predictable and overdone dialogue, Stranger Things has it all. It's also extremely cheesy at times. I found myself flipping the screen off on multiple occasions because it got too idiotic for me to handle. It's an unpopular opinion, but I particularly disliked Eleven's character. Though the actress did a decent job at acting what she was given, I felt like her dialogue and gimmick was the most corny out of everyone's. It seemed like her supernatural powers were pulled off in the most cringe worthy manner possible (although nobody seems to agree with me on it.) There are many cheap jump-scares. Although some had good build ups, each one was the same - a sudden roar accompanied by a loud sound effect.To conclude, Stranger Things is okay. With some shows and movies, I can look past the negatives if the rest is good enough, but I struggled to do that on this occasion. I'll probably be watching season 2 to see what it has to offer.",7
North America,"**POSSIBLE SPOILER--VERY SUBTLE**Take the Goonies, make one of their friends an X-Man, put them in E. T., and replace E. T.'s mysterious government organization with the Syndicate from the X-Files, and then throw in liberal amounts of Easter Eggs from dozens of iconic 80s movies and comic books of the 20th century, and you start to get the idea of what Stranger Things is like. Rarely does a sci-fi show or movie hit all of the essential points for a perfect formula. This show manages it brilliantly, and like any good sci-fi, convinces you that this could actually happen, in spite of the fact that the premise is absurd. It does a brilliant job of keeping the focus on our core characters, and telling the story through their limited perspective. Further, the story never misses an opportunity to gradually develop it's characters with exquisite care. Whether we're seeing Joyce's manic desperation escalating, or Nancy's obsession grow, or Michael's infatuation progress we're never rushed and the show takes great care to make sure every character makes sense, and every scene leaves a lasting impression. A great show for binge watching, I absolutely recommend.",10
North America,"Seldom does a television series appear and get this much attention and excitement and praise, and even more seldom does the show actually live up to it all. Stranger Things is delightful science fiction adventure and thrills, with a surprising emotional core. It has so much going for it-- a superb cast, cinematic storytelling, humor, a touch of romance, and goosebumps. Plus a cool synth score that seems like it came right out of a 1983 John Carpenter flick.I came to this series late but am so happy I tried it. It grabbed me by the collar within minutes. Anyone who likes Supernatural, The Goonies, The X-Files, E.T., Kolchak, Stephen King stories ... well, this is a massive treat for you. I could ramble on and on about the actors, the pacing, the 80's period vibe/details, but I will just say, if you're considering Stranger Things, try it. Jump in. It's worthwhile.",9
North America,"Stranger Things is not the only the story about the adventures of Mike, Lucas and Dustin who try to find their missing friend. Nor it is only a story about a mysterious little girl called Eleven. It is something more meaningful, you feel it, the atmosphere and everything that encloses that beautiful TV show. People have different opinions and if you do not like something you do not have to hate on it. Just stay away from it. The down ratings Stranger Things gets are from the people who just can not accept the opinions of others. You can not give a TV show like that one star or two because there is too much effort put in it. My favorite TV show, thank you for that Duffer Brothers.",10
North America,"The degree to which they recreated the style, tone and atmosphere of movies from the early 80s is incredible. Every detail - sets, clothes, props, music, etc. - is exact. I happened to watch The Terminator (the original, 1984) not long after, and you would literally think Stranger Things was made by the same people, in the same year (if you like Stranger Things and for some reason haven't seen The Terminator, watch it now). Throw that movie, Poltergeist, the Goonies, Stand By Me, the Breakfast Club, and numerous other movies from that time period into a blender, and you have Stranger Things.The story is interesting, and the acting is mostly very good. The only negative is that being an 8-part TV series (so far), the pacing drags at times. Some of the actions and events are illogical, and there are a few plot holes. The basic story is kind of standard sci-fi/horror, but it's done very well.Those are minor gripes. The longer format also allows it to cover a wider range of its influences. It's not perfect, but there are few TV shows or movies being made today that are better.",7
North America,"Stranger Things is a Netflix original show created by the Duffer Brothers and it markets itself as a tribute to the classic1980's sci fi and horror culture.I saw the first season after having heard over and over again how great this show is, and immediately a few things stuck out for me, in regards to the show's originality.There is a fine line between paying homage to a book or a movie, and making a blatant rip off. And oftentimes, Stranger Things crosses this line. Some fans and critics have already said, that the writers of this show rely too heavily on nostalgia and on the source material they're supposed to be paying homage to.While recognizing most of the 80's sci fi references, and the plot elements that Stranger Things borrows (E.T., Alien, The Gonies, Stand by Me etc, etc), I also recognize references and entire plot lines that the writers of this show have taken from the 1990's TV-shows, like The X-files, Twin Peaks and even a lesser known sci fi thriller, The Pretender. There are entire scenes and story lines that look like they have been copied off of the X-files (even season 10, which came out last last year).It's difficult to find a modern show about the paranormal and supernatural that hasn't been inspired by The Twilight Zone, The X- files or Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I don't have a problem with that. The X-files was in turn inspired by Kolchak: the Night Stalker, from 1970's, and both the X-files and Stranger Things build their narratives on that ""80's paranoia and government mistrust"", as Chris Carter calls it.The problem is that when you borrow too much from older source material, and when you rely too heavily on the homages and nostalgia, you run the risk of compromising your own originality. And the lack of originality is Stranger Things' greatest weakness. This show doesn't break new ground; it doesn't surprise its audience that already knows their science fiction. Instead, it rehashes the plot elements that are over thirty years old and tells the same story that Chris Carter was telling us twenty years ago.The main antagonist in Stranger Things might as well be The Cigarette Smoking Man, sans the cigarette. The police chief who's drawn into this case, thinking that finding the boy will somehow help him deal with his own tragedies might as well be Fox Mulder or Dale Cooper from Twin Peaks. Or any other noir cop who drinks too much. And the mysterious science lab might as well be the secretive Centre from The Pretender.When critics and reviewers describe Stranger Things as ""Stephen King meets E.T. meets the Goonies, and with a pinch of X-files"" you know what you're dealing with - a potpourri of pop culture references. Well, I got most of those references. Do I get points for that now?Instead of coming up with something new, the writers repackage same old tropes and stories. It's the most shameless way to profit off of nostalgia and the audience's sentimentality. The creators sell us a poorly written story and underdeveloped characters wrapped in a neat bring-your-childhood- back package, hoping that we won't notice the bad product because of all the ""feels"".But it doesn't work for me. Because everything that Stranger Things has to show for - I have seen it before. I love old science fiction (it's basically all I read/watch); I love creepypastas and stories about shady government cover-ups, and this show seems to be made for people like me. But while I'm watching that very first scene, I know that I've seen this before. And I can make a qualified guess about what's going to happen in the next scene. And in the next episode (and I'm right on the money). Every plot twist, every development is recognizable and traceable back to the 80's and 90's source material this show borrows from, which only makes the next twist all the more predictable.Nostalgia baiting and lazy writing, that's basically hat Stranger Things is. That, and hype. Lots and lots of hype.",2
North America,"This is by far one of the greatest artistic creations/accomplishments of more than a decade. Duffer Brothers, you astound me. This series from start to finish (including the composed title music) is an absolute brilliant accomplishment. It's ominous, complicated, a cinematographic brilliance, and much more. The cast Winona Ryder was superb and the young actors couldn't have been a better cast. I absolutely cannot wait until the new season and am making sure everyone I know watches...even if I have to tie them a chair to binge watch season one. An absolute A+++.Cheers!",10
North America,Going through and reading the reviews for the show to those who hate it based on the fact that its not like any of today's shows ... you obviously missed the point it isn't suppose to be like today's shows its a show that is very nostalgic and takes you on a journey to what so many like myself in the 80s enjoyed ... no we didn't have the cgi special effects as what you are use to seeing today but the whole idea of a group of young friends having a wild adventure with a mix of mystery a bit of suspense and some corny fun is what makes 80s movies awesome and this nostalgic look back at that time is beautiful and well done.. what makes it so much more enjoyable is the music I am a huge fan to synth-pop/synth-wave/new-wave and 80s rock and pop ... so maybe you don't like the whole nostalgic pre-cgi corny cliché ridden tale but its Entertainment not meant to be taken seriously and that is what makes it fun ... too many of today's shows is too dry and lacks that fun element ... this is a break from all that actually its nice to just see a show that isn't pushing an agenda.,10
North America,"I gave Stranger Things a watch after hearing good things about it. After doing that, it's now one of my favorite sci-fi TV shows. Everything about it is very well done. The storyline, characters, and music were great. The kid actors did a very good job and didn't come off as annoying. The best actors in Stranger Things were Millie Bobbie Brown and David Harbour who play Eleven and Sheriff Hopper respectively. Stranger Things has a great 80's vibe. I loved the influences from Stephen King, Elfen Lied, and other things from the 80's. I don't want to spoil the storyline for season one because it was so good. Can't wait for season two to come out. The new season can't come any quicker.",10
North America,"To me watching Stranger Things was really engaging. Even though I'm not a native speaker it was quite easy to understand, it was the first TV show that I watched without Portuguese subtitles. A bad aspect was that the rhythm was very slow sometimes because maybe they wanted to keep the mystery until the last episode. In spite of that the actors were really capable and great. I recommend the show to everybody who likes terror and thriller, mainly teens.",8
North America,"This show is very exciting and interesting. In the following i try to explain why I think that. The show 'Stranger Things' is pretty new and kind off reminds of shows like X-factor etc. The show tries to create a certain 80's horror movie vibe and does it well, especially with the setting and the time it plays in. Every episode is well thought out and filmed in a way that every minute is exciting. The music and the sounds highlight certain events very well and gives the show an intense feel to it. You can always watch this show, even with your family. This show fits many personal preferences so many persons with different preferences can watch this show together. (Like in my Family) The characters also very well thought out and I always love it when when you get to like certain characters and to dislike certain characters. All in all you can say that this show is very good and exciting.",10
North America,"Well, this is really something you must watch! Everything about Stranger Things is absolutely amazing. I simply love the 80's! I was so hooked on it that I haven't slept all night even though I knew I need to go to work next morning. Winona Ryder astound me with her acting. And the kids...oh, boy...they are fantastic. Millie especially. She could be a big star in the future. The only thing that bothers me is...I can't wait for season 2 to come up!",10
North America,"get up, come on get down with the table get up, come on get down with the dickness get up, come on get down with my penis open up your mouth and let me give it to yoooooooouAside from that, this show is absolutely f*cking amazing. If you do not watch this show, you are not alive. The acting is top-notch, the theme is great, and if you have sex while watching this show, you'll probably focus on the show moreso than the sex. It's amazing. Watch it.",10
North America,"A young, brown-haired boy rides his bike down a moonlit street. Suddenly, the headlight on his bike goes out. After glancing down at the light, he looks back up to see a monstrous figure standing in the middle of the road, causing him to veer off into a ditch. He sprints away from his crashed bike into the woods. Whatever he saw, it wasn't human. And it was pursuing him.With haste, the boy darts through the front door of his house, out the back and into a tiny shed in his backyard.Silence.Hands trembling, the boy grabs his family rifle and loads it.The shed door creaks.His breathing quickens. He aims the rifle at the door.A low growl emits from the darkness as a shadow slowly rises behind the boy. He locks eyes with the hidden creature, allowing terror to consume him.Tension builds with the score; the fizzling of the shed's lone light bulb grows louder and louder as the camera zooms in on itSilence. A wide shot of an empty shed. The light bulb lingers as the scene gradually fades to black.On July 15, 2016, my parents and I sat down to watch the pilot for a Netflix original series called ""Stranger Things."" From the opening sequence described above, we knew we were in for something special.The story revolves around the mysterious disappearance of 11-year-old Will Byers and the odd rippling effect it has on the residents and atmosphere of 1983 Hawkins, Indiana. Will's mother, Joyce – a single mom already struggling with her own issues – becomes frantic and distressed in her son's absence.At first, the town seems unconcerned. ""Will probably just ran away,"" or, ""maybe he's hiding?"" Disappearances like this were rare at the time, as local police chief Jim Hopper is quick to point out. He says, ""You want to know the worst thing that's happened here in the four years I've worked here? The worst thing? It was when an owl attacked Eleanor Gillespie because it thought her hair was a nest.""As the investigation deepens, however, another person goes missing. A secret government facility is discovered in the woods of Hawkins, and a young girl named Eleven is revealed to have the power of telekinesis.My biggest fear for this show after seeing the trailer was that it would live up to its name, that its sci-fi and fantasy elements would overpower any sort of depth and realism present. While there are plenty of bizarre moments and far-fetched concepts in ""Stranger Things,"" they exist only to compliment the characters that keep us grounded in reality.The three main characters are 11-year-old friends of Will's named Mike, Dustin and Lucas, and Finn Wolfhard, Gaten Matarazzo and Caleb McLaughlin do an excellent job at bringing them to life. They play ""Dungeons and Dragons"" in their parents' basements. They laugh. They curse. They fight. It all feels genuine, and when Will goes missing, they band together and risk their lives to find him.Winona Ryder and David Harbour shine as Joyce Byers and Chief Hopper, respectively. Ryder conveys well the desperation any mother would feel after the disappearance of her son, as well as the raw determination to find him and bring him home. The character arc of Hopper from complacent drunk to fearless leader is also incredibly satisfying to watch.Amongst all of the great performances, however, the standout is easily Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven. Her character is shrouded in mystery and secrecy. She has a dark and troubled past, and her superhuman abilities serve as a gift and a curse throughout the story.Eleven's dialogue is limited, meaning that most of her character had to be communicated through facial expressions, mannerisms and inner dialogue, and 12-year-old Brown accomplishes this masterfully.""Stranger Things"" takes us back to the world of the 1980s, a world of Realistic-branded walkie talkies, Levi's corduroy jackets and wood-paneled station wagons. It was a time when kids could ride their bikes home at night without the fear of being kidnapped; when privacy on a phone call was dependent on the length of your rotary telephone chord.Its soundtrack is infused with 80s classics. In one scene, Will and his brother, Jonathan (Charlie Heaton), bond over ""Should I Stay or Should I Go"" by The Clash. In another, romance blossoms to the sounds of Toto's ""Africa.""Above all, ""Stranger Things"" is a love letter to 80s film. The tune of the opening credits is set to 80s-style synthesizers, which were commonly used in B-level horror movies at the time. Long hikes along railroad tracks evoke images of 1986's ""Stand By Me."" And as the children and Eleven fled the evil government scientists on their bikes, I'm sure that somewhere Steven Spielberg shed tears of joy on E.T.'s behalf.The Duffer Brothers have utilized the power of Netflix to create something unique. ""Stranger Things"" provides loads of 80s nostalgia for adults, while also reintroducing us millennials to the staples of that era. It is horrifying and uplifting; darkly humorous; unrealistic, yet somehow grounded in reality.With season two on the horizon and with presumably many stories left to tell, ""Stranger Things"" has only scratched the surface of its potential. Hopefully in the not-so-distant future, we will be able to look back on ""Stranger Things"" as a classic, a ""Goonies"" for our generation to pass onto the next. After all, stranger things have happened.",10
North America,"This show is amazing and me and my whole family love it, especially the fact that there is no political correctness, Please please please keep out all the gay and trans crap!!!!!!!!! It isn't needed and also more Easter eggs please, I love all of that. This is show is definitely ten out of 10 though.",10
North America,"Stranger Things is a 1980s inspired and themed science fiction horror Netflix show. The show is set in November 1983 and takes place in the fictional town of Hawkins. Hawkins residence live a fairly normal life until a boy named Will Byers goes missing in the woods. Three of Wills friends Mike Wheeler (played by Finn Wolfhard), Lucas Sinclair (played by Caleb McLaughin) and Dustin Henderson (played by Gaten Matarazzo) are very worried for him but what they uncover something more dark and sinister. After looking for their missing friend they come across a girl, who they call Eleven because of her tattoo. However they soon find out this isn't any ordinary girl but one with very special powers. It is very clear the show takes lot of inspiration from classics 80's films like The Goonies and ET.The performances from all of the cast are great especially the child actors, who show the right amount of charisma and banter you expect from kids growing up in the 80's. However, the star of the show here is definitely Eleven (played by Millie Bobby Brown) who plays the ET type of role in show. Millie's brilliant acting skills have a lasting effect on the viewer even though she has 42 words throughout the whole series.The Duffer Brothers brilliant writing and directing skills play with your emotions to create a love letter to all those 80's horror films. It's truly something special! 9/10",9
North America,"Best TV show I have seen in years. Characters are believable, plot is amazing, actors are great! I read a review somewhere that said it reminded old adventures produced by Steven Spielberg and I cannot make a better statement. Even though the trailer seems too dark, it doesn't happen during the episodes. It is a brilliant show, engaging and funny.",10
North America,"Stranger Things is the decade's ultimate 80s love-letter, and an innovator for internet television. And where better to release the show than on Netflix, the world's fastest- growing streaming service? Stranger Things is not only a memorable chapter for the 'Golden Age of Television' but also another great addition to Netflix's ever-expanding library of original productions. Alongside Daredevil, 13 Reasons Why, House of Cards, Orange is the New Black and the relaunch of Black Mirror; Stranger Things is another great addition to the streaming service/network.Stranger is everything you'd want from an 80s-set TV show: Spielberg-homages, Star Wars references, parallels to Xmen, conspiracy theories, and an adventure about childhood: filled with bicycles, mystery and realising what it takes to grow up.Stranger Things is simple yet fantastic. Small scale yet ambitious. Everything is done so well here. Definitely worth the monthly subscription to Netflix alone. Watch it now when you have the chance! Before Season 2 premieres this year!",10
North America,"Stranger Things (season 1) is set in 1983 and is an amazing recreation of that time period with great acting from all roles but especially great acting from all the child actors, some of the best I have seen.I really enjoyed the entire story from every episode of the first season. The cinematography was phenomenal and the story was perfect and gripping.As of writing this review I have watched 3 times and plan to watch it at least twice more before the next season airs.",10
North America,"What especially impressed me was the uniformly excellent acting of the children - really very impressive.I always think ""tone"" is one of the most important qualities a movie needs to possess - it needs to be coherent, well-thought out & consistent. ""Stranger Things"" has a very particular tone - the '80's feel, the homage to horror/sci fi/fantasy traditions - that is perfectly realized. It manages to be referential & ""cliched"" while still seeming fresh & original - a very clever trick. Congratulations to the Duffer Brothers!",9
North America,"Important thing for any series is,you should go to next episode eagerly. This is achieved by this series.You keep on asking questions and you next thing is you will get more questions.Within 10 minutes you will get hooked to this series.Pace of each episode is great and has only eight episodes.Viewer who like investigation and sci-fi and are new to this genre will like this series. But viewers who have watched already number of good sci-fi and horror series or movies Will find it old stuff. All the characters are well written and developed over the series.Only negative thing is that,the story is clichéd as you go towards the conclusion. Hope they work on the story for the second season. This series is especially for children. I could have given 8,but towards the conclusion has disappointed me.",7
North America,"I kept getting told to watch this show but didn't finally give in until February 2017 after seeing the Super Bowl ad for 'Stranger Things 2'. I watched 'The Twilight Zone', 'Star Trek' (Original), 'The X-Files' and a host of other shows but this is among the best shows I've ever seen.The entire cast is phenomenal and displays a great balance of adult life, teenage life and childhood. They do a great job with the kids especially, making them feel like the kids we all grew up watching in 'E.T.' and 'The Goonies'.The story is second to none. I watched the entire first season in 3 days, watching the final 4 episodes on the 3rd day. The entire plot centers around the mysterious disappearance of Will Byers. A boy who ultimately won't be found within the confines of our reality. Then a girl classified as '011' becomes known as Eleven or El after she joins the group of boys looking for Will.Winona Ryder is particularly impressive. Anyone who remembers her movies like 'Lucas', 'Beetlejuice', 'Edward Scissorhands' and 'Girl Interrupted' may confidently say this is her greatest work. I was never a big fan or her not did I ever dislike her, but she impressed me in this series. Winona's acting is unbelievable and her dedication to the story is outstanding.David Harbour's Jim Hopper is perhaps the most intriguing character. He varies from lazy and uncaring, to a dedicated investigator, to going far beyond the call of duty to making puzzling deals.We then have the saga of teenagers with Nancy, her boyfriend to be Steve, Nancy's friend Barb and Will's older brother Jonathan who is searching for his brother. Nancy is really in a tough situation throughout the series, caught up in a love triangle, battling her mother for her own independence and attempting to solve the disappearance of her missing and presumably dead best friend Barb. This situation draws Nancy and Jonathan together.The most rewarding part of the series is when the groups of characters finally all come together and share the information they've individually discovered.",10
North America,"If you are a kid of the 80s (or not so a kid), this is definitely your series to watch. The aesthetic is similar to those brilliant adventure movies from the 80s like ET or the Goonies. As for the story, we could say it's a mix between The X Files, Poltergeist and ET (kind of). First of all, this is not a horror series, although you might get a scare once in a while, but is more of a thriller. Something strange is going on, and since the first second you might guess what is it, but you won't understand what really is it until about half of the season. The season consists only of 8 episodes, so it is easier to watch it in a row, as once you start watching one you won't be able to put it down until you are down; and I am talking from experience.Then we have the actors, all kids are brilliant in their characters, you really feel like flying with them on their bikes. As for the adults, Winona Ryder is back into action and what a way to come back!! She plays the stressed mother whose kid has gone missing, although at sometimes it looks like she is overacting, she is simply wonderful and makes us remember on why she was one of the best way down in the 90s. Do we hear a Golden Globe nomination? Maybe.Fantastic Netflix original work (finally!). Not a sequel, not a movie adaptation, but something original. Yes, influenced by Stephen King's works and that 80 style which makes us feel nostalgic, which might be one of the incentives to watch it, so please watch it, you won't regret it! Just stop what you are doing and go binge-watch it! It's only 8 hours, one Sunday are you are done! Go for it!",9
North America,"I got to tell you, Stranger Things is one hell of an awesome ride since I've watched the movie Super 8 for the first time back then. There's no spoilers, so you're good. I must say, in my opinion, this show felt like Super 8 but it's more thrilling than Super 8, but it's very entertaining. I recommend you guys to watch it if you have not seen it yet. :)What I also like about this show is that it's from a Co-Executive Producer who once produced a TV Film Adaptation of Disney's Tower of Terror. :)",10
North America,"Stranger things is a product of 2016 and people should pay attention to this. It surely used old well-known elements or settings from the 1980s but I believe that people should stop thinking of films in the 80s and stop comparing it to them. Let us take a look at the series objectively and from the modern point of view ! Surely it belongs to a genre that was started a long time ago and the 1980 nostalgia exists but please do not overreact because of this fact. Analyzing STRANGER THINGS in short: 1. The most important part of a cinema masterpiece or a TV series is the script. The script is just great, keeps you interested and does not involve retarded mistakes or plot holes. Some scenes might develop in a more obvious way that I like (i.e. not so original) and some words might not be the perfect choice in some cases /IMHO at least/... Then again originality is rarer than gold these days. But to be honest the script as a whole is just fine through the whole season 1. The script here lays a great and sturdy foundation of the ""family house"" the creators are building. A house of mystery, fear and bravery, of action and of basic human emotions. 2. The actors are amazing. The kids are natural, Dustin in particular is just the kind of kid that people will love and the kind of actor that is acting using his talent and to the best of his ability. Winona Ryder gives us a lot of strong emotions to chew and surely lives up to the image of a movie star she had in the past /and probably never lost/. 3. The effects are probably not the maximum possible movie high-tech wonder but they look cool and fitting to the main atmosphere. I surely do not expect more of the FX team for season 2. 4. The more you watch, the more interested you are. It does not get boring. Stranger Things does not crumble because of some soap opera motives like ARROW did. 5. You just have to like kids and sci-fi to watch, if you do not like kids just get out of here. :) ------------------------------------- Obvviously it is not plausible to just talk about what I liked about Stranger Things so let me point out some weak spots: - the bad guys often behave in a stupid and inert way - the cop sometimes takes weird decisions - several things in the last episode were very unacceptable, I don't wish to include spoilers...If Game of Thrones should get the gold medal for the best series of 2016, Stranger Things goes home with the silver ! 9/10",9
North America,"Well done Netflix. What a great series. I binge watched all the 8 episodes in one day and still wanted more. I am left wondering a lot of things after the final episode. I also have questions about Will's dog. I think there is something special there. Why was the dog in the house was when Will came bursting home and no one else was there at that time? Wow, what a fantastic cast. They all work together so beautifully. Some absolutely magic performances and I can see awards being won by this show and individuals in the cast. Millie Brown is a natural. A real special talent indeed. I was really taken by Millie's facial expressions. I must say that Matthew Modine played an outstanding slimy rat. I did not like his character the first time I saw him. Well done Matt. Not really wanting to single out any individuals from an equally terrific bunch, but I hope credit is given to great performers. I was just blown away with the 1980 props eg: that left over from the 70's teak timber wall panelling; sickening colour schemes; the technology of the day (phones and walkie talkies) various furnishings, ornaments (I noticed the glass Christmas tree which came full of chocolate coated nuts), cloths, and hair styles etc which were all gorily awesome in their detail. Was it really that bad? It is full of fun clichés but it's like a good book you can't put down. I gave it a 10 star rating, and I thank all those involved.",10
North America,"Stranger Things is a series that takes us back to the good old 80's and 90's. By watching it we are automatically referred to this time when the Steven Spielberg films were alarmingly successful. ET; Carrie; And so many other films of the genre seem to be reminiscent of excerpts from Stranger Things, which leaves the viewer with that air of nostalgia and this is a good emotional effect that TV shows and well- made movies cause in viewers. I really appreciate that genre.",10
North America,"Well for my first review ...This series are Epic for a scary on a regular basis maybe 15 years for my opinion well i did see only 2 episodes and my excitement for what will happen next has no words to explain . Well for me it will be the epic intro for the new Alien movie :P , i feel a lot of dramatic content and it is my most newly experience of this sort of a movie mix.",10
North America,I hope everyone reading this blog have seen the film E.T by Steven Spielberg and if you haven't seen the film please go and check it out because it's an awesome film which has inspired several other films and shows for more than 20 years in the sci-fi genre and this show is one of them.This show has not only taken the sci-fi element of the movie but also the style of it's execution.It just means the show has many similarities with the movie and had a great impact on the audience.The show is crazy and the amount of accolades it got was equally crazy.Check out articles like this at : www.paul96.orgArticles related to the show :http://paul96.org/stranger-things-the-enhanced-little-one/ http://paul96.org/eleven-the-ferocious-wonder-kid/ http://paul96.org/mike-wheeler-and-friends-the-four-lads-of-hawkins/ http://paul96.org/stranger-things-other-characters/ http://paul96.org/the-concept-of-super-powers-subjecteleven/ http://paul96.org/stranger-things-the-best-episodes/,10
North America,"This a very good series. It atmospherically reanimates the 1980s, a decade which despite never having seen myself, seems to be the home of many of my favorite stories. The series's reliance on child actors, a bet which I think rarely turns out well for directors, seems to have succeeded here. The special effects were masterfully and more importantly tastefully done.Winona Ryder is the real star of the series though, and her portrayal of haggard single mother is mundane and brilliant. Another great Netflix series! I look forward to watching the next season.(I binged this in February 2017.)",9
North America,Stranger Things did in 2016 what 13 Reasons Why has done in 2017!! Took everyone by surprise and turned out to be one of the best new shows in their respective years!! ????The four kids in Stranger Things act in a way not even the adults could... and that's what adds to the awesomeness of this show!! Consisting of only 8 episodes in the 1st season... a little less as you may think... but such less itself leaves you spellbound!! ????The 2nd season of the show is scheduled to arrive in the second half of 2017 as the rumours say... which will be keen to set new landmarks for the supernatural genre for the TV shows!! ????,10
North America,"Stranger Things is what I consider to be the best Netflix original series to date. Not only does it include references to the works of Steven Spielberg, Wes Craven, Stephen King, and many other prominent creators of the 70s and 80s, But also features relate able, and well developed characters that are all given so much to do. No one in the series feels unnecessary or just thrown in, they all have good character motivation and they don't just do things for no reason. Even when a character does do something that is kind of dumb you can at least see where there coming from.There are much more things about this series that's great, but, I don't want to spoil anything, and I kinda wanna keep this as short as possible, so all I can say is that if you're a fan of any of the writers and directors I previously named or just science fiction in general, then this series is definitely for you.",9
North America,"Let me explain first. I am a big fun of sci-fi pictures - not only from the 80's - but this is not a good one. OK if you like ET, X-files, Cocoon and similar films then you probably like this one. But if you seek for real sci-fi suspense then stay away. So much fuss for nothing. OK I must say that Mrs. Rhyder tries hard and kids act decent but that's all. I prefer go and watch again the Goonies or Philadelphia experiment.. Slow, spiritless, nerveless and without inspiration.",8
North America,This show just blew me away when I first watched it it's amazing and the 80s setting was great because that's when I grew up but I hope for the new season there is more episodes because there was only 8 for the first season but they do that sometimes just to see if people like the show so they probably will be more roll on October.CANT WAIT.!!!!!!,10
North America,"This is a television series that's set in Indiana and has won several awards. It's a mixture of drama, horror, mystery and science fiction.The first season is set in 1983 and was released in July 2016. The second season is set in 1984 and is due to be released in October 2017.A young boy goes missing and his friends look for him. They instead find a young girl who has telekinetic powers. The authorities claim that the boy has been found dead. However, some residents discover that his corpse is actually a dummy and that he's alive. They then try to establish contact with him.The writing and acting are good and it's significantly better than most TV series. However, it's slow in parts and I don't agree that it's outstanding.",8
North America,"Cinematography: All of the scenes are filmed very well, the Red Dragon really shines here. Definitely made for a 4k TV. The CGI is really good and the old Film effect really helps with the atmosphere.Cast: The cast really makes this show special. The kids are some of the best child actors i have ever seen.Story: The story is very different from many other story lines, and it always surprised me. F.ex. Not the typical Lovestory with the Hero saving the girl and then becoming her boyfriend and rather a story about the hero then helping her even more and becoming some sort of friends. it doesn't get boring.The Soundtrack: It is awesome.I really don't understand the bad Reviews, watched the show in one day straight.",10
North America,"If the influences from 80's movies and the actors being children is the most important things you can praise this series for, it proves that its not that good. Story-wise it looks like one good Fringe episode stretched over a whole season and you guess it so early it loses its magic. Yes it is well set up, children are great and 80's thing might pick up your fancy but all these just didn't work for me to forgive the weak plot. Referencing 80's, synth music and all seems like an easy way out these days.",1
North America,"Obviously, it is so highly-rated because of its lofty ambitions & qualities for a ""TV show"", sort of like Twin Peaks & only a couple of others. It is also fun to spot the '80s artifacts & references, esp to films. Did everyone catch the Ferris Bueller one? It is also hard to stop watching anything with some kind of ""TBD"" monster waiting to be shown. However, the problems: ET-worship goes overboard by the 4th episode. The good-girl-trying-to-go-bad schtick is a main reason for Freaks & Geeks being canceled after 1 great season. The characters and their relationships are ALL Cliché. Every single character has been done basically exactly like this in a previous (multiple) film or TV show. Here's one: where have you seen anti-social-male-teen-from-wrong-side-of-tracks interacts with world through photography before? Stock character. Check. Starting in episode 3 or 4 (iirc), characters started to make inexplicable decisions, e.g. the sheriff breaking into the top-secret federal base, the good-girl-trying-to-go-bad entering the Upside-Down, etc & the show started to go off the rails.I will almost certainly not watch Season 2. The Duffers get ""A"" for synthesis but ""D"" for originality.",6
North America,"My episode by episode ratings will give you an idea of the kind of show it is and how good it is:Ep1- 9/10 Ep2- 8/10 Ep3- 7/10 Ep4- 10/10 Ep5- 6/10 Ep6- 7/10 Ep7- 8/10 Ep8- 8/10Because there's no excellent elevation, we'll take the cumulative average:7.8/10It's a pretty good show that starts compelling, but that by episodes 5-6 really loses its steam. It regains some in episodes 7-8 but never hits its two best from early on. Ep 4 is the best one.The directing and editing is superb and casting is good. I liked it and would recommend a look, especially at the first 4 episodes, but eps 5-6 you could miss most of and not miss much.A decent show that once again proves just how elite Breaking Bad was because it doesn't come close to it.7/10",7
North America,"The first season is amazing! I have been anxiously awaiting the second season, and then I watched the trailer. As excited as I am to see what happens, I am completely walking away from it simply because it found a way to include a deservedly dead pedophile's music. I understand the era and time it was popular, but there are many more musical hits that could have been used. Thanks for ruining the series for me!",10
North America,"First and foremost, Stranger Things is a very entertaining show. The acting, 80's references and a general lighthearted tone all mash to make a compelling show. The entire first season is about find Will Byers, a 12 year old boy that disappeared into the ""Upside Down"" a alternate dimension that corresponds with our world. After Will disappears, his friends find a girl (nicknamed Eleven) that says she knows where Will is. There are subplots that interlock with the story that are all interesting.When I first heard about the show, the idea of a show built around child actor worried me a bit. Child actors, mostly, fall into two categories: genuine and disingenuous. Luckily the excellent direction from the Duffer Brothers and the performances from the kids fall into the former. 80's culture is perfectly ingrained into the story. There isn't too many, nor are they made the focal point of show. The film grain on the show is subtle enough to be noticeable to the audience, but again, is not too obvious. The music is mostly good, but it can be too electronic at times.My problems with the show start with the demogorgon, a monster that lives in the Upside Down. **Minor spoilers** The demogorgon comes into real life through the wall in a sequence that feels like a bad sequel to The Last of Us. The build up for the creature is immense, but both the look and actions of the monster fall flat. Scenes like this lack real stakes, and this does not have much tension. **Major Spoilers** The last major scene has Eleven sacrifice herself to the demogorgon as she disappeared into the Upside Down. This was entirely forced and contrived. The series builds Eleven as essential to the puzzle that is the Upside Down, but this scene uses her as a plot device. It is your classic set up for another season that shies away from themes introduced through the entire season. It's a shame.But those are just a few of my complaints. I doubt most people will have a problem with them. Overall though, it's just such a fun show to watch and I'm excited to see where it goes. Happy Bingeing!",8
North America,"The high ratings for this show continue to surprise me a year later. Terrible, plagiarized tripe, from two brothers who would make the Chuckle Brothers look like the Coppola's.It just kept getting worse and worse - silly acting, predictable story- line plagiarised from countless 80's classics and dumbed-down to the extent where it became laughable.Truly sickening to see this utter tripe lauded by so many. I shall not be watching the second season of this garbage.",1
North America,This series is about things that are strange stranger things it's amazing it's so good I was Hoocked two or three episodes episodes in . even tho I was wondering why am I hooked I don't like but I do. It's so good kids killed it it's so amazing its about a kid named will and his missing from town. from the 80s and ET and Steven kings novels and 80s said nostalgia the cop also is amazing he is so good he is investing and interesting and deserves nomination. these kids deserve enemies that's how good they. Warning spoilers are coming so u r warned 11 was amazing one of the best characters is the who show if this doesn't start i career I don't what does she oops almost think it is a he. 11 is so good and deserves A Emmy i don't know why she doesn't have a nomination unless she does one Of The scenes that I starting liking the show was when u starting caring for these characters in this show. It had great dialogue in this series s. One of my favourite scenes is when 11 shows off her super powers I felt how the kids felt cause I was a kid and I felt the connection they did I was actually a kid unlike kids now. actors today never get sprites that kids say kids say kids things like me when I was a kid a kid. I There r scenes that r just like ET like when they all are talking to each other and it's like ET and stand by me they have the power guy which is 11 and then it was ET they have a scene on the train track it's literally stand by me and then they have Goonies things like so many times then they have so many references the one thing that makes it not a perfect series. But it's not two grades down because of that it's not ET or standing by me for me it's not that level of goodness but it's good tho and don't get disappointing . Its just a series or is it. back on topic it's so good. when will is missing the people think the mom is crazy but later we find out she is not crazy the things out kids say kids things like me when I was a kid a Re crazy when will is found he is very bad and is sick and barely survives it's sad but true. The kids think it is gone but the monster is still out there. To cap off the review it is a entertaining series just a mystery. The kids and adults do good thing s so I would say 8.5 out of 10 it's amazing and the best show in years dispose me not watching any shows in years ??,8
North America,"Merits: The season is very short in compared to other TV series. This makes it watchable as you don't have to invest so much time- 8 episodes versus 22! The cast was excellent. Hats off to David Harbour and Millie Bobby Brown. They were brilliant! The Upside Down concept was good, though it couldn't be connected properly to the creature.Demerits:E05- Why didn't Nancy and Johnathan go together through a passage to the Upside Down? Was Nancy had that brevity? And how did she escape the passage, when it was shown that the creepy creature saw her! E07- How come Barbara couldn't be saved and Will was? At least they could have tried! The last major scene was entirely forced and contrived.. Eleven vaporized so that they can show her coming alive in the Second Season was totally unnecessary.Overall, a one-time good watch!",7
North America,"the only very amazing thing about this is the setting or mise en scene of the 80's; including the photography, music and dressing of the characters. Winona also has a solid performance, as an experienced actress. Everything else is f*king stupid. WHY THE HYPE? It's a generic story with generic characters who are not likable, except for the curly haired kid. Sci-Fi? really? please...Waste of time. I know everyone loves the bald kid, this show, the ""love stories"", but I'm not one of them. i don't see anything special about this, AT ALL. Seriously, why you like this, people? If we're talking about weird ""sci-fi"" stuff who has no scientific background whatsoever you can totally watch Twin Peaks. WAY BETTER. This is laughable, boring, generic, and too long for the slow paced and weak story line.",2
North America,"Stranger Things. Long story short: I loved it. I watched the first season in two days only. However, before I start watching it, I didn't know if I was going to like. I mean I didn't watch any trailer or read any review. I began without knowing what it was. I watched the first episode, and then I could not stop. The actors play very well. Moreover, I'm a big fan of David Harbour. Then, the story is perfect. In each episode, there is more suspense and we want to know what happens next. I really love the way that the series is shot. The thrill is maintained and the feelings are forwarded. So I can undoubtedly tell you that Stranger Things is one of the best TV Shows you'll ever see.",10
North America,"A reprise staged with ambiance, fiefdom of classical 80's hits like E.T., X-Files and The Exorcist, this show is a time traveler for fans who love the 80's and want to see a reboot from best of both worlds.Though I've followed GOT, Walking Dead, Dexter, Supernatural, Sense8, X-Files, Twin Peaks and some of the best series out there, I rarely write reviews, but this one is an exception.It brings the best of everything that an 80's born would love to see. Winona Ryder justifies her role of a strong, persistent mother who wants to save her child from evil. And the Kids, yes they're portrayed like 80's kids, damn, you'd just want to give away everything to see their pure childish innocence, will, wit and clan.Makes you think; Did we miss the best of our generation and is it behind us and long gone, no, optimistically it's not gone.",10
North America,"Whoever wrote the script and directed this series didn't do their homework, or the story was written by AI. All of the storylines are taken from some other shows in the past and put together under different names and situations. The protagonist can't act well. He shows his frustrations in his facial expressions too often. He doesn't establish chemistry with the female lead. The female lead is a typical woman reacting to dangerous situations with indredulity and confusion. The director should have had some ideas for making the acting more credible. Each time, one character appears who represents each player of the story, the Asian woman who works in the White House, the terminator guy who represents the FBI, etc. Acting is wooden and the story is predictable. The car chase scene in episode one is almost laughable. They shouldn't put in a car chase if they can't outdo myriads of other car chase scenes already tried before. Overall, a terrible disappointment.",4
North America,"First of all the acting was refreshing but that was expected given the cast members.One might be quick to consider The Night Agent to be yet another conspiracy thriller series full of the same clichés and contrivances that you'd expect. It's true that this isn't the most original show of the year, but at the same time, that doesn't prevent it from being an incredibly engaging watch. With 10 episodes, each clocking in around 45 to 50 minutes, The Night Agent is exciting, addicting, and successfully able to balance a storyline that could have easily become over-complicated. We've seen shows like this that start off promising but then fall victim to an overcomplicated plot where if you even blink, you may be missing a key plot detail. That isn't what The Night Agent is. The storyline is concise and easy to follow without ever descending into simplicity. While there are certainly moments that aren't the most realistic, it never takes you out or makes you stop caring.",8
North America,"The first episode is highly derivative. If, while watching this you think to yourself, ""I've seen this before,"" you have. The train bombing scene is very similar to the one in ""Source Code (2011).Even the title of the series is derivative of John Le Carre's book ""The Night Manager.....and the tv mini-series of the same name. I could not find anything similar, other than the name of ""The Night Manager,"" when I compared it to episode 1 of ""The Night Agent,"" but I am certain something will show up in future episodes.There also seems to be a little bit of ""The Good Shepherd (2006)"" thrown in for good measure.Finally, you should know that even the ""exciting"" scenes of this first episode are plodding, dull, and boring. I made it halfway through episode 3 before I fast-forwarded through the remaining episodes. The story at the end is just as boring as the beginning of the series was.This series is simply a bad take on a classic genre. Be sure to avoid it if you are an espionage thriller buff.Bad! OH SO BAD!",1
North America,"I didn't know this was based on a novel by Matthew Quirk starting it so I wouldn't know if this was a great adaptation.I liked it still. Not perfect by any means. It's your typical political thriller drama with twists and turns. Nothing new, you can say maybe cliche too certainly not something to win awards with but if you're into that genre I'd say give it a go? It was a surprisingly smooth ride. Kinda exciting. Had some good tension and action. Nothing too over the top. The characters didn't pop out as overly annoying or too gary/mary sue type. There's several povs that they focus on aside from Peter and Rose that I thought connected well so it doesn't feel too one sided.I like Peter and Rose. Rose I thought was going to be damsel in distress but thank god she's not. She earns her weight. Peter giving Owen vibes from The Recruit (another Netflix show starring Noah Centineo). Let's just say he can do his job well but sometimes you question some of his more hinky choices haha though perhaps less charming compared to Owen. The actor feels more like Gerard Butler movies saving his country type guy. My favorite characters are Dale and Ellen. I love unhinged characters. The other characters are good they have more going for them that just one off tropes.The vibe of the show I'd say is more similar to Bodyguard (the one starring Richard Madden). It's not as playful as The Recruit was. Anyway overall I thought it was a good watch!",8
North America,"Good production value but that's it. The dialog, oh my, is so bad, so dumb it makes my head hurt. Script in general must be garbage since all the characters are one dimensional and full of overused dumb tropes. I honestly don't think any actor can work a bad script like this.I was really annoyed with a rescued princess type that has a problem with the world or anyone trying to save her. What a horrendous trope.But that's nothing. Only a second episode in and a bunch of unbelievable/ lazy things are happening like chatting with someone on the White House emergency phone and holding up the line. No problem, that's just the same phone you called the night before to save your life, why allow the same opportunity to someone else.Saying you can't lock the door behind you while an assassin is chasing you and there is clearly a basic latch shown... etc.I think I'm gonna quit now, I gave it a fair try.",5
North America,"I almost had high expectations about this but boy I was disappointed.The main story is not that bad, it is cliche but I don't mind this. A lot of shows or movies have cliche stories but if they are well written the outcome is great. That's not the case with The Night Agent.The script is mediocre at best, the characters are badly written, there is no chemistry between them and the bad guys are almost laughable.The acting is also very weak especialy from Gabriel Basso. He looks like he doesn't belong there (among other things).Luciane Buchanan is doing a little bit better.It has a good pace, I give them that and the fighting scenes are not bad but these are the only reasons I don't give this show an even lower rating.",5
North America,"Will anybody be left alive after a couple of episodes? If people working for secret services were killed that often, there would be no secret services. Why is it necessary to have so much pointless violence in movies? Because the screenplay writers can't think of any other events? Because young audiences adore violent scenes? What a disappointment, both for those who like good movies (and good plots) and those who know anything about secret service organizations. I gave up after the first episode, as it is clear that it will be nothing but repetition. Death as the main attraction? Truly a pity...",1
North America,"All the hate in these reviews!! Why? Let me tell you, people don't watch tv for just entertainment and the thrill of the chase nor the step by step uncovering of the truth; they watch to criticize actors and decisions of writers. I love a conspiracy thriller series and Netflix provided just that in this show.Also if I watch something and don't like it - then I don't like it but I don't put it on blast and turn other people against it just because it wasn't my cup of tea. These type of reactions to shows are the reason so much hate exists in the world.The show was good! I really enjoyed it! Watch it if you love a good government conspiracy!!",10
North America,"IF you love bad acting, then this series is for you. IF you want stupid dialogue, the this series is for you. IF you want to paint the FBI with a bad brush, then this series is for you. This is just painful to watch... If you don't believe me, give it a try! Try watching the train bombing and not picture bad acting. Try watching the night at the aunts and uncles and not picture extremely bad acting. I don't know about you, but if I just saw my aunt and uncle assassinated, I would be traumatized and devastated but the niece's acting is so bad it was ""just another night out""... Try to picture the car chase and not think of bad acting. The dialogue is beyond painful and the characters have no ""realism"" or ""chemistry"" to them at all. Whoever wrote this and screened the actors needs to find another line of work... BAD BAD BAD.",4
North America,"Its probably pretty difficult to make a movie/show about the contemporary FBI/CIA or any government agency in a positive light and not have it be a complete farce, but it's like the writers didn't even try. The acting by the leads is a little better than par for the writing, which is absolute hot garbage. That being said, even certain deliveries of average script were off, and as others mentioned, there is absolutely no chemistry between characters/actors. The overall tone of the show is so flat and predictable, and there is no denouement from the non-stop basic and somehow boring action sequences.Characters are so static, not just depth wise but emotionally. Like every situation regardless of someone dying is just this artificially tense dialogue and acting.",1
North America,"With that said.. Was it a masterpiece? Something you'd see on the big screen or Oscar-worthy? Probably not.It's full of clichés & other typical formulas,that would be found in similar television shows or movies.From a female perspective.. It does keep your attention,did watch all ten episodes in a day.Acting to actors chosen & cinematography,was decent enough.Is this worth watching? Sure. Not certain it would be something to rewatch,like other series.On a final note,again.. Why bad reviews? It didn't seem low-quality or budget and had many known actors,action & dialog wasn't deplorable.Give it a chance before,deciding off reviews alone.",6
North America,"Ok so what's up what all these negative reviews, let me tell i just finished watching all 10 episodes (50 min each) and thought to just check the rating but oh boy people are just giving very negative opinion here. It's same as Netflix recent series ""THE RECRUIT"". I have watched that one too and i loved that too.Yes, I agree that the story is little bit stretched all that happening in one go but for people who love spy-thriller conspiracy type TV -Shows will 100% love it. It's exciting, easy to follow and concise.Talking bout acting department loved that as well. All the actors from did their best especially gabriel basso Loved it so farTo summarise in one word IF U HAVE ENOUGHT TIME (10 HOURS+) U CAN AND SHOULD DEFINATELY CHECK IT OUT , WORTH THE TIME OTHERWISE U CAN SKIP IT.Have a lovely weekend to anyone reading this.",9
North America,"I was immediately interested in the first episode. It has murders, chase scenes and excitement from start to finish. That spilled over to the 2nd episode. But then by episode 3 it got dull and boring. Too much backstory. However it got fairly good again towards the climax in episodes 9 and 10. Although the premise that the vice president, chief of staff, head of secret service, and several others were involved in a conspiracy to kill a world leader along with the president at camp david seemed implausible. Also the vice president willing to let his daughter die in an explosion also seemed insane. I think if this had been 5 or 6 episodes instead of 10 then it would have been more entertaining and kept its fast pace. Otherwise it was a poor copy of ""24"".",6
North America,"Like many have complained, the acting is not great on this show and the lack of chemistry is apparent. Might have more to do with the script than the actors themselves. Who knows....but the story isn't very good either.Netflix doesn't know how to make compelling, strong female characters. They seem to make the female characters, annoying, toxic and controlling. And at the same time trying to portrait men weak.The Night Agent, Gabriel Basso, is a SIMP. He is supposed to be working at the White House, but he is only about satisfying every whim of Rose Larkin. Who is annoying and entitled ""victim"" who shows barely any emotion even after her Aunt and Uncle were murdered. She believes she is more capable than FBI to solve the case.It's very hard to say anything good about this show. Well, D. B. Woodside did some solid work.",2
North America,"This series is filled with cliches and amateur style acting. It's the kind of acting you'd expect from a 1970s porn movie. Some of the emotional outbursts of the characters make no sense at all, and it's almost comical how quickly these characters can randomly show up to respond to calls or take care of incidents. It's like they're all flying in space ships or warping around inside the show.I didn't really choose to watch this one, the wife found it on Netflix and I sat idly by half paying attention to it. Couldn't help but laugh at some of the scenes and cliched one-liners that you thought would've died during the disco era.",4
North America,"Watched because had some time and seen most other highly rated shows. Pleasant surprise. Liked the cast, not Oscar worthy performances but good for this kind of show. The lead actors both were very good. Nothing new but nevertheless a good fast paced spy thriller. Plenty of action but not excessive. The plot unravels at a steady pace and Kept me engaged and binge watched over 2 days. Some background on all characters. Some posturing and subtle references to so called woke commentaries. Have not seen most of the actors in the show before. Watched this with an open mind. Overall I loved this show.",9
North America,"Cliche plot, quite predictable; no chemistry between actors and writing is not exactly the best.The acting falls short sometimes, however there are a few moments where you almost connect with the leads.On the other hand, it will keep you entertained for what it is; a TV show about Agencies that you can watch when there's nothing else on.Remember why you're watching shows; to pass time and unplug, relax and have a good time. In that case, it will do the job if you get into it without any expectations. This is definitely not art, this is not pure garbage either.Not great, not bad, just above average.6 out of 10.",6
North America,"Started out great and then it went downhill real fast. The acting is not bad... but if the story is problematic... what can the actors do? There is an overkill of action for no reason and the script is farfetched The characters are badly written and the bad guys are unbelievable and that is putting it nicely.It's not like they didn't spend money money on this thing... the sets are nice and the overall production is first cabin. To me it seems like they thought they needed to put way more action than clarity... which fell to the wayside. Like another persons' intro... ""Bad writing ruins everything"".",5
North America,"This TV series is surprisingly very good. My husband loves suspense spy thrillers and he could not stop watching. Yes, we binged watched the series! From the first episode, it hooks the viewer in. As more information is revealed the series captured our interest even more. It was a pleasure to watch Hong Chau as well, who is amazingly talented from The Whale and Poker Face! Love that Hong Chau is in this series as well! Will there be a 2nd season? I certainly hope so!! Great series! The rest of the actors were very good as well, and there are some familiar faces. I hope that some of the current cast will appear if there is a 2nd season.",10
North America,"Well written story, captivating and interesting from start to finish. Yes some episodes did get boring and lacked creativity, was very predictable and felt stretched out but it was mostly entertaining with well held suspense. Sutherland is a brilliant actor and they couldn't have chose a better person for his role, the other actors were also great. The backstory was good but I felt it was too focused on it at times, the ending was okay. It had the perfect amount of action, emotion and chase scenes. I rate it a solid 10, everything about this series was so good that I binge watched the whole 10 episodes. Some lines could have be written better or not been used amongst other characters but overall pretty good. Check it out for sure!",10
North America,"I have to say, to give some series on Netflix a 10/10 is just not what I normally do. (My IMDB account got deleted...)This is not only an outstanding story, but the acting is spot-on. The main actors in this, although unknown to me but for the guy from the terminator, are professional and very slick! Everything looks and feel natural. The writing is just so good and although I am only halfway through, had to be commended on the excellent style!I was very surprised to have such high entertainment in a series. This could have been a top-notch movie, if Netflix decided to go the ""silver-screen"" route, instead they give us an 'on-your-edge-of-your-seat' whodunnit masterpiece I know will stand the test of time.Excellent job to Netflix and all the actors!",10
North America,"That 'The Night Agent' (limp title, by the way) was taken from a novel is apparent from the way that the story flows, in a largely time-linear fashion, with few and only brief explanatory flashbacks. Furthermore, there is a continuity to the plot, rather than an episodic tone, which too often happens in stories told in a series, with individuals appearing one week that you sense are going to make a small but telling contribution before being killed off before the credits to that portion of the story roll.Our unlikely pair of heroes - or 'star-crossed lovers', if you care to see them in a Romeo and Juliet context - are brought together when a married couple of secret agents are accidently overheard by their niece, Rose, discussing something of significant 'national importance' before being wiped out by a pair of professional hitpersons. Before dying, they provide Rose with a secret telephone number answered by an FBI agent, Peter, located (for some unexplained reason) in a windowless office in the bowels of the White House.As all of this takes place in the first half of Chapter One, I do not feel that it is giving too much away of the plot by explaining this unlikely connection. Suffice to say, the story evolves over ten chapters to a conclusion which may be seen as a somewhat far-fetched 'tangled web we weave', but not impossible, involving the usual motivations of a lust for power and a greed for money. Peter and Rose (maybe, with names like that, I should have likened them to a fairy tale rather than Shakespeare's lovers!) are the central characters in the story and they play their roles competently and credibly; Peter (Gabriel Basso) is somewhat wooden and one-dimensional, but that may suit the impassive nature of his character, whilst Rose starts off as the stereotypical 'helpless heroine', but eventually reveals a tough and resourceful core. There is little 'chemistry' between Peter and Rose, but there would not necessarily be any, as he was just doing his job and she was trying to cope with the sudden deaths of her aunt and uncle, the only remaining members of her family at the start of the film.The leads are surrounded by a decent cast, including the two hitpersons, various colleagues and friends of Peter and, eventually, the most powerful person in the world, namely POTUS. One of the characters, a short and feisty female senior member of the White House staff, reminded me a great deal of the character in 'Veep' played by Julia Louis-Dreyfus, in that she seemed incapable of completing a sentence with 'dropping the F-bomb' in it! Unusually, at times we see the story through the eyes of the hitpersons, who are revealed not as 'faceless goons' but as individuals simply trying to do a job - however unpleasant and illegal - and get through life.There is the usual allocation of people hitting, and being hit by, other people, shooting at, and being shot at by, other people and car chases, but these moments are never excessive, disproportionate or irrelevant to the plot. Like peeling away the layers of an onion, the story becomes revealed in a stepwise fashion in a way that never seems illogical or ridiculous. The pacing of the development of the story is slow at times, but without ever becoming tedious.Whilst I am sure that there are a thousand and one reasons why what takes place could never happen in reality, at no time did I feel that the actions of individuals were out of context with their roles and personalities and nothing stood out, for me, as impossible or incongruous. This was a well-made, entertaining and gripping tale which I would recommend to anyone with the interest and concentration to follow a story from a small, insignificant beginning to a powerful, albeit unlikely, climax.8 out of 10 stars.",8
North America,"What is it with the vocal fry with female actors? So much croaking it's driving me nuts. A good show spoiled by poor side plots. How is it there are eagle eyed conspiracy theorist sitting outside the very building our main protagonist parks. From across the road they seem to be less interested in their food but more interested in looking at random strangers in case they are wanted killers. Please !!And did I mention the exaggerated croaky voiced females who seem to think that putting on a strange voice is somehow clever, sexy or attractive? And I'm also wondering how it is that I need to write so many words in this review.",6
North America,One of the better shows Netflix has produced. It has good thrills and better plot twists that you don't see coming. The acting in my opinion was on point. And a female lead who is not overly ambitious or powerful but not afraid to get her hands dirty along with a male lead who isn't like a normal action star and always handly beats the bad guys. If Netflix can stick to this formula I think they'll have a good success for future seasons and shows. Hoping for a second season.the chemistry between the two is pretty great too. Overall a very good watch and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes espionage thrillers.,10
North America,"Couldn't make it it through two episodes before turning it off. From the lack of police support when he sees the bomber after the train incident, to the immediate swap of killer to cop during the search for the girl hiding in the closet, and the fact that she didn't want to tell the FBI that she saw the killer in case they were in on it (the killer already saw her see him, so the bad guys know anyway).The acting and characters are very bland except for the bad guys, but not enough to carry the show IMO.Watch ""The Recruit"" (same genre) to see how good acting and a smart writing can make a difference...",3
North America,"Despite the low budget feel to this series, it percolates at an even keel but always aims forward. I was drawn in and binged it to the end. The action is well choreographed, the pace accelerating with each episode. The many plot points kept me intrigued; as each layer is uncovered, the intensity grows.That is not to say this is perfect. Far from it. Despite the interesting plot, holes as big as the Grand Canyon make for some forehead-slapping moments. The dialog is colorless, derivative and cheap. The soap opera elements bog down some of the middle episodes but I'm glad I stuck with it. The pacing and action are worth it and the two main characters are appealing.",8
North America,"I can't understand some of these reviews here on this show. I started it yesterday and it has gripped me from the first moment. It's going very interesting and I'm on episode 2. Can't wait for more.I interrupted my work just to see what's next. How can people say such bad things about this? If you're looking for drama and excitement, then it's here. Someone even said there's no chemistry with the lead stars. What? Something is wrong with you hopeful critics.Please don't listen to them. Watch the show for yourself. I remember when Red Riding Hood with Amanda Seyfrield came out, and I went to the cinema to see it. I loved it and raced home to do a review. I was shocked by the negative reviews. It was then that I determined never to follow other people's reviews but to watch a show for myself.I read these reviews before I started The Night Agent and I'm glad I ignored those reviews because I am enjoying the show immensely. Will do another review when I finish it.",7
North America,"This is not just predictable it is about as painful as an 8 hour episode of CSI if one were to be made. Absolute cardboard action, acting, set design, characters and dialogue. I am wondering who is writing these 10 reviews because this is actually worse than Reacher to be honest.I guess this is hitting the target market for people who have a hard time with anything other than your most basic regular crime, spy or political thrillers or perhaps the readers of sun par books on holiday.If you like, that's fine, I personally would rather paint dry than be able to ad lib better lines and imagine a real story that could have happened. Netflix is really scraping the bottom of the barrel lately and this is a perfect example.",4
North America,"I don't Understand all the negative reviews. This is the best action series i have seen lately. It's captivating (watched it in 1 day), interesting plot twist. None stop action and suspense will keep you glued to the screen. Sure there are many things that seem unrealistic/unbelievable but who cares. It's not supposed to be factually accurate. Most action movies packed with unrealistic things. Sure it's not Oscar worthy but it's not 1/10. So to counter some of super low ratings I'm giving it 10. I enjoyed It and i think many people will too. Hope there is part 2 and hope it's as good as this one.",10
North America,"One year after thwarting a terrorist attack on the Washington D. C. metro, FBI Agent Peter Sutherland (Gabriel Basso) works in the basement of the White House monitoring an emergency phone line that never rings for a intelligence program called Night Action jointly reporting to the FBI, and the President's Chief of Staff, Diane Farr (Hong Chau) who got him the position despite Sutherland's history of having a father who allegedly turned traitor that has made Peter a popular target for conspiracy theorist. When cybersecurity specialist Rose Larkin (Luciane Buchanan) moves back with her aunt and uncle following the collapse of her startup, her first night she hears them discussing urgent matters in hushed whispers before their home is attacked by two assassins (Eve Harlow and Phoenix Raei). Before her aunt and uncle are killed they give Rose a phone number with a code phrase they tell her to call along with the words ""Osprey was right"". Retreating to the neighboring house, Rose calls the number which puts her in contact with Peter who helps her stay alive during pursuit until the police arrive. As Peter takes over Rose's protection, the two are thrown into a wide reaching conspiracy that reaches all the way to the highest echelons of power.The Night Agent is an adaptation of the 2019 novel of the same name by Matthew Quirk and began development in 2020 under the stewardship of noted TV writer/producer Shawn Ryan. The show was picked up by Netflix and has recently debuted on the streamer and I'm happy to say it's an engrossing and thrilling 10 episodes of television.From the opening metro bombing where we're first introduced to Peter Sutherland, the series immediately gets you hooked as it jumps to one year later and the unexplained bombing has been co-opted by liars and conspiracy theorists who try to smear Peter as complicit in the bombing rather than a hero. The show does a solid job establishing the high stakes of the series while also creating both Peter Sutherland and Rose Larkin as likable and engaging characters who you want to see put together the pieces. Gabriel Basso gives a really good performance as Peter and having been a fan of this actor since his days playing Adam Jamison on The Big C, it's nice to see he's developed into a capable leading man with a relaxed masculine charisma that gives him the same level of appeal Robert Redford had in Three Days of the Condor. Luciane Buchanan is equally good as Basso's co-lead sporting a sense of humor and spunky self-assuredness that makes her skillset complimentary to Peter's with both characters getting equal chances to shine.The show also features some solid supporting performances with Fola Evans-Akingbola very good and charismatic as young but determined Secret Service agent who is paired with a welcome appearance by Lucifer and 24 alum D. B. Woodside as a more seasoned but damaged veteran. But most prominently we have Hong Chau who is very good as Diane Farr who gets to play with the conflicted nature of her character. Chau is quickly becoming one of those actresses I look forward to seeing having loved her appearance in 2019's Driveways and continuing her strong run with notable appearances in The Menu and The Whale in 2022, and I'm pleased to say Chau is no less good here.The plot covers most of the major beats you know from this type of conspiracy thriller and if you've seen the British series Bodyguard or the movie Three Days of the Condor you'll have a pretty good idea of the plot beats that are struck in terms of what kind of story this is. However, just because this is well trodden ground don't mistake that for a lack of quality because you don't always need to be original but you should always need to be engaging and the movie does a good job of that. While The Night Agent takes itself seriously (in comparison to the more dramedy inclined The Recruit), it does take pauses for exchanges between our cast as well as moments of genuine humor that give the show a bit more personality than you'd probably expect upon first seeing it. This even comes down to the assassins played by Eve Harlow and Phoenix Rael (whose characters I don't believe are named in the series) as they have this quirky romantic relationship that's showcased in between the chases and shootouts. As with many conspiracy shows there are the occasional bits that do stretch disbelief, but for the most part the central mystery was keeping me engaged especially when it was complimented with engaging characters and performances.I really enjoyed The Night Agent and think it's a solid 10 episodes of TV. The central mystery has a great hook and a pair of likable characters, there's a strong feeling of tension and paranoia during the investigation, and there's not a bad performance from the bunch. While the show does leave the door open to continuation, I'm pleased to say the series is mostly self-contained and doesn't brazenly ""season bait"" so if there is a second helping of The Night Agent I'll gladly take it if it can be kept to the same level.",8
North America,"It's probably too soon to judge this series for me since I've only watched the 1st Episode but I can't ignore how badly it was written from point of security. The agent talks on the speaker phone in front of this woman whom he just met/ saved. He gives out all secret Svc info such as the code name for the operation. Every time she asked a question he give out too much info like "" this is an abnb belong on a friend of mine's acct!! I may like the show later on simply for being an action show but seems like writers had no clue how the secret Svc/fbi operates! I was surprised that he didn't ask her for the pic of paper that she used to call him immediately after they met!",3
North America,"If you like the first two episodes and see absolutely nothing wrong with them, then keep watching and you will enjoy.If you watch the first two episodes and started having questions about the writing, acting, ex machina, lack of coherence....then stop now and save your self the trouble....it does not get better.1. Good looking protagonists who cannot act...check
2. Very little security at the most secure places on Earth...check

North America,I too like other reviewers had high hopes for this one. We were looking forward to an exciting action packed series and I genuinely thought it might be another version of 24 but then the F words started. We watched two episodes and had to stop. As is so obvious and prolific in modern shows - the degeneration in script writing standards unfortunately continues with the unnecessary use of bad language that adds nothing to the story. The plotline has so many elements from other shows but as to what happens after the second episode we'll never know. I hope someone will make a good series soon without the unnecessary bad language or sexual content.,5
North America,"I thoroughly enjoyed the entirety of this fast-paced, sometimes comical, always intriguing and wee bit romantic saga. There were no few ""F-Bombs"", but apart from that I was so happy to see there was a minimum of gore and gratuitous sexuality. .Few of us are naive enough to think the government is all truth and noble pursuit. Thus even the story line had a ring of truth to it. I found myself cheering when the bad guys were thwarted and scratching my head when some new twist begged for an explanation.All in all, it is one of the better series I've seen in a long time. Please tell us Seasons 2, 3 + are on their way.",10
North America,"I don't even know where to start. You know that feeling when somebody tells you a lie and it's so obvious that you don't know if you should be mad because they're lying to you, or because they take you for a moron? That's the feeling you get when watching this show. It's so awfully stupid and lazy.A simple example; if the VP's daughter get shot in the leg she probably won't be moving around limping for the next few days. No crutches, no wheelchair.People don't say ""we have digital copies"" when they talk about files on a digital camera.These are just two of many examples throughout the show. Every episode again. Watching these kind of shows makes me wonder what it actually takes to become a writer for TV. And do they watch the result and think that they did a good job? Because to me it seems that they got bored after episode two and decided to cut corners wherever possible just to be done with it.",4
North America,"I must say I never thought Night Agent would be this good. I was expecting more drama at the white house and some few killings here and there. To my surprise it's a lot more than that. It's very thrilling and gripping action mystery to be solve throughout the entire season. Everytime one episode ends it's creating this urge or temping me to want the next and so forth 'till I realized it's already 6am in the morning. I was darn hooked to it I never realized it's already sunrise. I never had this same feeling since 24 tv series on the same genre. Not as the same hard gritty action as 24 but the story, suspense, thrills and pacing almost the same. I totally enjoyed this one. Too bad Season 2 seems unlikely at this point but if they do I hope they maintain same level of formula as season 1 or even better.",10
North America,"It is a Well paced thriller keep you hook from the first episode. The pace of the continues from episode to episode but it never loose the pace. Instead it gets better as it reaches the final episodes and very well enjoyable finale episode to fish the show. Reasonable action scenes and gripping story. Finally Netflix made an action drama series which has standards to meet the likes of Amazon Prime. Another great show which is based on the bestselling novel which never fail to entertain the viewers. Avoid the negative reviews and tune into get entertained with roller coaster ride of action, thrill and fun.",9
North America,"A great show! Gripping development of plot, likeable lead characters, nice action and suspense. Of course as with practically all shows of this style there are some far-fetched moments, but at the end of the day it is entertainment, not a documentary. It is fun to watch and keeps your interest.I do wish writers would stop having all characters use the f-word all the time, but this is common in contemporary shows. To me it is just lazy writing. Intelligent, professional people speak accordingly. Nonetheless, this fault doesn't detract too much- we binge watched the entire first season and look forward to another!",8
North America,"I was hoping for a good new action series, with some of the actors listed it was promising, Liked the 2 first episodes, but after that the quality of the story loses it, as it was a collection of plots from other movies/series. Many of the scenes became confusing /disconnect and there are big gaps in the story and it seems to been cut down, and that very poorly, it must be the explanation for the sloppy storytelling . And on top of that the female actors are overdoing the cool, tough and rude attitude. Worst is probably the way the plot changes locations back and forth almost like the entire story is taking place in the same block. Be prepared to be disappointed.",1
North America,"Is this the most well-written or well-acted show on TV? Absolutely not. Was it fun & action-packed? Absolutely! Gave me '24' vibes...sometimes we just want to be entertained and go along for the ride; this ticked those boxes for me, and I would love to see another series, felt like they were setting up for one at the end! Enjoyed the relationship between Peter & Rose too, look forward to seeing it develop. I do think the show needs to decide if it's going for the 'young adult' audience or wants to go full on 18+, it seemed to hover between the two, so I think they need to commit to one or the other. 8/10.",8
North America,"The first four episodes were entertaining enough. The subsequent episodes became cluttered with a plot full of holes, multiple minor characters, and too many twists. Ten episodes was way too long to carry the story. The major characters were developed unevenly. Can we get a series where modern people don't have family/daddy issues? Is America headed in the wrong direction because of bad parenting? I like the two evil villains and wish they could have their own Killing Eve type show. Psycho hit lady was actually the best character. Her boyfriend was a close second.I made it through all ten long episodes in spite of the overly complicated plot and awful music. Back to watching reruns of Dr Who til spring returns.",5
North America,"The White House has a bat phone manned by our policeman hero. He is a hero because at the start he saves a train full of people and is good with kids. He has to answer a phone that hasn't been used as far as he is aware. The phone it turns out; is for when foreign spies who have flipped and started working for the good guys get in trouble. That is to say if you were spying on America and they catch you but you want to work for America and not go to a dark hole forever then you are obviously going to need someone in counter-intelligence who doesn't know anything about you or your circumstances, who has to look up stuff in a binder for when you find yourself in trouble you call the White House. Honestly it really makes more sense this way. If I say it more clearly it makes absolutely no sense at all. So when things are at their worst for the hapless foreign spy ""Night Action"" protocol can be invoked by those with the number and codewords. If you can access this shadow state you get through to a guy in a windowless office who doesn't even have a computer because stuff is so secret and has to ring other people to ask them to do stuff for him whilst looking at busy work for a year. In a windowless office in the White House. He has to physically go there in order to answer the phone and then call other people on the phone without leaving the office. He is highly trained for this role by the FBI but recently got head hunted into Night Action jointly run by the FBI and the White House Chief of Staff for call handling and sensory deprivation. I'm not sure how bad the budgetary problems are in the Federal Government but you have a highly trained operative on call handling duty. To be fair he is being shared by the FBI and WHCoS so that's a positive. Does he need to be in the White House though? Is anyone going to go and speak to him in person?If all of this is starting to sound a little implausible then perhaps the entire thing is an elaborate joke being played on hero cop. It may have started as a cherished office tradition that escaped the ban on hazing? New inductees were told about ""the Night Action"" in hushed tones. Each new member was introduced to ""the phone"" with a sense of reverence and left alone to begin their vigil. All other previous candidates got up and left after 12 minutes, nobody in the office had our hero pegged for 12 months. The joke had obviously got out of hand and perhaps sensing that the hero is about to snap, the WHCoS assures hero cop that in fact it all hasn't been a colossal waste of time and talent but instead; for ""the last 12 months I've been training you for something I wasn't sure what for."" We reach the apparent climax of the show right here: it turns out this wasn't just a prank gone on far too long but this was in fact the final test. All the other candidates had proved their good judgement and common sense so were useless to the President. Given the vague and meaningless explanation for the horror he had endured in the box ""for something I wasn't sure what"" our hero stands firm. Rather than scream with frustration at his wasted sanity our hero proves he is a ""good soldier"" and ""ready to do whatever it takes"". This is said in whilst stood in front of the star spangled banner. We have entered Executive Death Mode. In episode 3 he builds the death star. Research and all the other stuff spy stuff was actually happening back at the real office (which resembles every generic NCNCIS set). It is staffed by a great bunch of guys. A really terrific group of hard working behind-the-scenes characters. They will generate a great deal of generic, genial but also sometimes, really genuinely touching and heartfelt subplot.The algorithm has decided this is what we deserve so what are you going to do about it?",3
North America,"I cannot understand some of these poor reviews and.quasi-esoteric complaints about poor writing. I found it to be compelling and watched back-to-back episodes.In contrast to quite a bit of Netflix offerings, this series had a good story line developed over 10 episodes and ended very well, and to that it left it open for a sequel. I would be the first on board to watch a part two series for certain.Bosso and Buchanan did very well as the two main protaginosts. Their performances were quite believable for the desperate situations they found themselves in. Fola Evans-Akingbola and D. B. Woodside were very welcome in supporting roles.",10
North America,"However, all of the actors involved tried. I am glad all of them found work. So I score it a 2. The rest is terrible. Stiff and bored performances barely prop up the worst script. Cheap foreshadowing. 'We are such good friends.' Guess who gets it next? I feel this would never have been filmed without the casting of Hong Chau. Honestly, I feel like I got punked to watch this. It seems like all the actors are reading the weather. Blah, blah blah. Hate to provide a negative review, as I know the no name cast did what they could. The premise of the story is so dumb. Imagine there are several high level government officials in on trying to take over the government I guess. I guess because it is too dumb to even believe that the story was created.Watch the Recruit. At least there are some laughs.",2
North America,"THE ONLY CHARACTER I DIDN'T LIKE WAS ROSE.THEY MADE HER INTO AN ANNOYING PETULENTTEENAGER WHEN WE KNOW SHE IS AN ADULT FROM THEBEGINNING FROM THE CONVERSTION WITH HER AUNTAND UNCLE.SHE IS ADVERSARIAL IN ALL DIALOGUE AND IT ISTIRESOME, BUT THE STORY MAKES UP FOR THEAGGRIVATION. THE AGENT ACTOR BASSO WAS VERYGOOD AND NICE TO SEE ROBERT AGAIN.REVIEWS IS ASKING FOR 200 MORE CHARACTERS BEFOREPOSTING A COMMENT. SO HERE IS THE SYNOPSIS:
The Night Agent is a sophisticated, character-based, action-thriller centering on a low-level FBI agent who works in the basement of the White House, manning a phone that never rings -- until the night that it does, propelling him into a fast moving and dangerous conspiracy that ultimately leads all the way to the Oval Office.",7
North America,"Mostly because of the two leads but a great supplemental cast especially the Asian agent. The first ep had non stop action. The rest slow down as they begin unraveling the huge conspiracy. Terrific show that yes is not too original but then what is these days. Reminiscent of the recent The Recruit, Condor and The Bodyguard but that's ok because those were all good shows also. Only halfway through and it's definite binge watchable. The two aforementioned leads are very likable and the show excels when they're working together. Ignore the whiny complainers who literally hate everything, probably including themselves.",10
North America,"There is an interesting premise here reminiscent of Jack Ryan type spycraft and conspiracy thrillers, but the characters do not act like the people they are supposed to be.FBI agents apparently have no training in firearms, hand to hand combat, or evasive driving techniques. They also have no protocols for any scenarios, and their safe house procedures are a joke . They talk to one another like a pack of school bullies.Worse, the witness seems to have a better idea how to protect herself and investigate who is behind the conspiracy than the people charged with protecting her.I think the writers performed their research by watching bad network cop and FBI shows. Regardless, common sense should have kicked in to give some semblance of proper procedure.There are also odd subplots that don't add anything to the primary plot but keep appearing to slow down the progression. In particular the assassin's who prove to be complete sociopaths yet the show keeps trying to force us to relate to and feel sorry for them. Weird.Even so there's enough to here to watch, even if the end wraps up in familiar fashion.",6
North America,"Only thing I could not get over of this amazing, wanna be, Netflix version of ""Jack Reacher"". Is that the lead character is honestly the love child of Chris Pine and Connor McDavid from the Edmonton Oilers hockey team. Seriously look at him! Normally would not post a love child that is not solely movie/tv. But.... k well now I have to type in at least another 200 hundred characters. But if you put the two picks of McDavid/Pine, you'd see that I'm spot on. Show honestly deserves the binge though, great acting, great story line, even got T1000 playing a cop again. Brilliant. It would have been a ten out of ten if I wasn't stuck in this Chris Pine and Connor McDavid love child thing... it's distracting as hell.",8
North America,"If you think MCU is peak cinema you'll probably enjoy this mediocre garbage. Terrible acting, unconvincing action, every scene so improbable it left me asking ""seriously?"".Can netflix please cast a strong female lead who isn't insufferable? Having a bored, irritated and stubborn female lead is one thing (objectively awful) but to pair her with a doofy agent who is obsessed with her (for some reason) is truly agonizing. The worst part is there is zero chemistry and it just adds to the totality of everything in this show falling flat. The ""zinger"" one liners in this are so utterly cringeworthy. Just truly terrible.I love government agency shows but this was an abomination. I'd rather rewatch The Americans.",1
North America,"The Night Agent formula: the mix of Mission Impossible, 24, Patriot Games, and all those famous threats to US President combined into 1 TV series called The Night Agent.The good news is it is entertaining and a great choice to relax with a bowl of popcorn.The bad news is, there are not much of opportunities for every actor in this series to develop their characters. The series is very fast paced and leave very, very few seconds for an actor to show their acting prowess. This formula was successfully develop by 24 but The Night Agent only has 10 episodes to introduce the main characters, so they kept the main characters focusing on 1-2 person on focus at any given time.Overall, if you are looking for a good entertainment to relax your tense brain and you like action films, watch The Night Agent, you'll get good action and fast paced story you usually enjoy in cinemas at TV screen.",7
North America,"Oh, (groan), not another one of THOSE . ... and an entire SERIES, no less!! I suppose some would consider this a mid-range (ratings-wise) action movie to be viewed when in the mood for short doses of ANOTHER collection of the impossible and implausible situations. The worst is the character ROSE .... another mindless, clueless airhead who wanders through the piece as the maiden in distress, alternating hot and cold, ability-wise. Was this character written or designed the way she is? Is she a product of poor writing, or poor acting? Ditto for the super hero, indestructible, boy scout male lead .... a result of poor writing ability, or poor acting skills? I lean heavily toward serious problems in the writing and directing departments! Things only get worse as the series progresses. If you're looking for ""not to be taken seriously"" chunks of diversion, loaded with a lot of ""Are you kidding me?"" moments, look no further! This one is for you!",3
North America,"TV screenplay that is on par with other highly watched series, and better than many ""made for cable"" mini-series. However, it tries to incorporate too many genres. The gratuitous video game violence may try to bring in males with arrested development who still live at home. But sadly, it is a poor excuse to deal with characters that the writers could not intriguingly integrate, and instead merely kill off. There is a bit of National Treasure meets espionage which is compelling. But the cat & mouse, fish out of water, spy genre is insufficiently focused -- to be a compelling thriller. There are plenty of teaser sub-plotlines which are dangled before the audience, but insufficiently developed, only to be ultimately tied together with little character and story development. Edit this series down, and it would be a good 2-part episode that feels like Dean Devlin's Leverage.The shining star is Hong Chau, who brilliantly plays over her age with gray hair (absolutely genius touch), but has beautiful hands. Her performance makes the illogical facts seem remotely plausible. Also an honorable mention to a rock solid performance by Gabrielle Rose, who was under utilized.Hint: If a writer is going to attempt an espionage / corruption screenplay, then they had better get their technological issues correct. Here, The Night Agent dismally fails by confabulating unrealistic technology excuses for lack of writing skill. E.g., discussing ""air gap"" security, then transmitting WiFi from within a faraday cage secure facility. And, switching SIM cards in the same ""burner"" phone, which remains trackable with the same IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity). Further, there is a running joke in Hollywood that deeply insults any person with an IQ above 120 that a SIM card must be destroyed to be untrackable. And if you passed spy training, you well know that you only need to wrap your cellphone in 3 layers of aluminum foil to block all RF (radio frequency) signals. Proof -- try it, and then have somebody try to call you. All the cellphone tracking myths used to compensate for poor writing skill, merely demonstrate the deficient status of contemporary education. And if you can't find aluminum foil in the kitchen, just put it inside a metal pot with metal lid. Fortunately in The Night Agent, they used the Subaru Forester 2nd Gen update, which does not come with any uplink (trackable, StarLink) system.",6
North America,"The Night Agent starts off promising with its intriguing premise and cliché but entertaining storyline. However, It becomes difficult to support the female characters due to their excessive portrayal of a tough, cool, and rude demeanor, and one can't help but wish for the female lead to be killed by the killer.Furthermore, the portrayal of the secret service is disappointingly weak and ineffective, and the police are portrayed as stupid. The plot execution lacks depth, and the storylines and subplots are not well-developed.Overall, The Night Agent fails to deliver on its promise, and the weak execution and unsympathetic portrayal of its female characters make it a disappointing watch.",6
North America,"Yes, there are plenty of clichés involved. Here's the thing, how many different ways could you possibly write a political action movie? Seriously? What, there's like maybe 4 different possible plots?1)The President, Vice President or their family is kidnapped.2)The President, Vice President or their family is in danger.3)The Vice President plots against the President.4)The extremists want to take over the country.Pretty sure that covers all of them. So yes, this will be similar to several movies and/or TV shows. There's no possible way around it when there's only so many possible plots to use. I binge watched all ten episodes and I enjoyed it from start to finish. Don't let these bad reviews about clichés chase you away without even giving it a try.",8
North America,"Professional keelers which never hit on the first shot? Check
Bad guys which dress and pose, and put on an accent of bad guys? Check.Standard stupid car chase when no one hits no one, no fatalities or injuries of other drivers and bystanders when driving against traffic? Check.Counter intelligence seceret agents discuss confidential affairs when their niece is upstairs? Check
The fate of the nation is in a single hard drive? Check
The hot fbi agent set a breakfast date with the hot witnesses exactly at the time of the attempted hit on her? CheckAnd I watched only 2 episodes. .Nothing close to real spy movies of John la care.But I still watch it, so it has some entertainment in it.",1
North America,"Every now and again it's good to watch a series where not a lot of thinking is required. The Night Agent doesn't require much thinking. It's harmless but not much substance. As a teacher it is reminiscent of something teenage boys would right. The storyline and language are both cliched and full of plot holes.Locked doors that seem to take big guys ages to push open. Guns with silencers. Obvious bad guys walking the streets of Washington in trench coats and guns strapped to the leg and an overzealous use of the ""f"" word.Probably the most irritating part of the show is the FBI boss who speaks like she is a robotic character from Futurama. She would also be the dumbest boss in any spy series.",6
North America,"I rate the first three or four episodes 3 out 10 due to poor character development, unconvincing delivery and terribly written dialogue. In addition almost all the strong roles are women and the men, especially the lead, are emasculated. The young female lead, the neice, goes from being a cyber security expert civilian to playing a key role in all Secret Service and FBI activities in one episode. It was not able to suspent my disbelief past 30 minutes. If you're looking for examples of Hollywood desperately trying to advance womens' roles at the cost of forced acting bordering on laughable, this is it. There are some believable female roles, but the director/production decided to promote as many female roles as possible. Even if the acting is weak and the roles are not well cast. The most interesting characters are the assassins, especially the male who is killed off in the 8th episode. The overall story has good potential and shows complexity, and it's fairly well developed throughout the 10 episodes ending in a predictable conclusion. But there are so many instances of weak line delivery and poor writing you'll start yelling at the TV or grasping your head in disbelief. In the final 6 episodes the action increases and characters are knocked off raising the stakes and increasing tension, allowing you to take the focus off the weak points I mentioned and get into the developing story. I would rate the last three or four episodes 7.5, but the major weaknesses are still present. The series gets off to a very shaky unbelievable start and ends predictably. In the hands of an experienced director and screenwritten by a Breaking Bad writer this series could have easily been a 8.5+. Disappointing...",6
North America,"I am always sceptical when yet another FBI/CIA/spy conspiracy show comes along. But I gave this one a try, and it got me in right from the start. I ended up watching all 10 episodes over 2 nights (which I never do) because, like a good book, I couldn't put it down.The producers didn't treat the viewer like and idiot and spoon feed the plot information to you. You actually had to work it out yourself.There were plenty of suspects and red herrings, some really good suspense, some decent acting, and no unnecessary blood and gore.A very good ""who done it"", then ""who done it to who"" and ""why would they do it"" suspensful action drama.Sure, there were plenty of clichés and plot holes, but you expect that with this type of show (FBI agents and professional hitmen who couldn't hit a barn door from 10yards...)
I'd certainly still recommend it if you like these type of shows.",9
North America,"What is this really? The cyber security genius girl can do everything and anything! She fights trained assassins, she tells everyone what to do, she kills trained assassins, she does investigation better than experienced detectives, she talks down to everyone including the president, she acts and talks as everyone on this planet owes her something! I wouldn't have had any problems with any of this and could have just accepted her as bad cliche writing! However my biggest problem is that she is presented as the moral compass of the story, as a role model for young girls, as someone to look up to! And that just scares me!",3
North America,"Gabriel Basso provides a solid performance as FBI agent Peter Sutherland. Basso has considerable depth and range. Moreover, his posture and physical affect are in perfect alignment with the various situations he finds himself in.Luciane Buchanan, on the other hand, who plays the niece of two covert FBI agents is stiff, monodimensional; over-the-top insufferable, and undeservedly entitled. She offers some range in the final episode so she is capable of nuance. Perhaps the flaw is with direction. There are five directors; each responsible for two episodes.The script and plot are a mess. There is misrepresentation over the various responsibilities of the NSA, FBI, Secret Service and CIA. Furthermore, a civilian is able to do things that no civilian would ever be permitted to do. Low-level FBI agents have direct contact with the president; something that would never happen in real life. For that matter, they also have direct contact with the White House Chief of Staff. That's never going to happen.Finally, real conspiracies have very few conspirators - the smallest number possible to achieve their goal. There are just too many unnecessary conspirators.The series IS entertaining. I watched all ten episodes. However, I note that the crew does not include a consultant; someone with government experience.The series is based on the book of the same name by Matthew Quirk. However, the plot of the book involves finding out who is a Russian mole in the White House which seems greatly more believable than this series' conspiracy theory. Presumably the book does a better job in the realm of who does what with whom in the White House.",6
North America,"I'm on episode 3 and have got hooked on it. It's a great action and it keeps me going. I would definitely recommend to anyone whether you love action movies or not. It's also a good suspense that keeps you off your toes, like what's going to happen. It makes you wonder who you can trust and who they can't. You may think you figured it out but then there's someone else. The acting is good.I hope they have another season. Makes me wonder if each new season will be based off of another person in protective custody or if the plot will continue. Like I mention, I'm only on episode 3 so unsure how final episode will end.",10
North America,"It has moments that give me hope, such as the charismatic co-leading Gabriel Basso. But too many amateur, shallow spots poke holes in those dreams.Someone storms out of a room to leave the conversation, and unexplainably comes back into the room asking what's going on. Non-sensical leaps to further the plot and it's only episode 2.The show lacks depth and nuance, opting instead to play on a potentially good plot with embarrassingly obvious and hyperbolic emotions I'd expect on a 3rd rate remake of Buffy.I'll watch one more episode to be sure as I'm only 1 in, but the lapses are too egregious to leave me feeling anything but insulted and disappointed.",3
North America,"Maybe my user opinion and writing skills are no better than others, oK. But this is not a '7.5' rated production, unless you also think shows based on video games is a plot unto itself like the overrated ""the Last of Us"". This is supposed to be a high level conspiracy story, but there is no consipracy. Not even the conspirators know what side they are on the connections are so random. I am sorry writers and producers, there needs to be a conspiracy in a conspiracy story, not just a blank box to ""insert conspiracy here"". The Audience wants a few clues that hold up longer than the next shallow scene.",6
North America,"This series is highly entertaining and a great watch. It is so nice to see a simple story, written beautifully, and acted so well. It is great to have Gabriel back in a series. He was fantastic as the son in The Big C with the fabulous Laura Linney. Now he leads this series and does a terrific job at it! It was great seeing a series that didn't spend 30 minutes with its setup, explaining how characters got where they were. This was taken care of quickly, basically through simple talk between characters. So welcome back Gabriel! Long may this fabulous series reign! I hope Netflix is listening to these positive comments.",10
North America,"Same old, same old!! This had nothing different to offer than the hundreds of action films and series of its kind! It is characterised by many as a great espionage thriller series but I have to disagree. There are few plot holes here and there and the acting is just..decent, nothing special. Believe me, there aren't any surprises and no thrilling moments. I guess, it's an OK watch if you our out of any other options.If you are really looking for a remarkable series of this kind and still haven't watched it, search for "" The Americans "". Real suspense and superb acting. You will not be disappointed!",5
North America,"If you have ever seen 24 or any of the CSI iterations, you've actually already seen this series and don't know it yet.There's really nothing original about it at all. You can easily predict every plot-line after the first episode. Just think ""what's the most cliche thing that can happen here?"" and that's exactly what will happen.The acting ranges from bad to mediocre. The writing, as mentioned above, is both predictable and infuriating.The only good thing about the entire show is that I'm happy to see Netflix try to make something that's geared toward adults. It's a swing and a miss IMO, but at least it's not another teen drama.",4
North America,"One of the better conspiracy series in a long time. The story is well built up. Diffferent storylines comes together in just the right tempo. Action, dialogue and some light humor are in balance. Acting is maybe not perfect at al times from all actors, but surely above average. The only real weakness I experienced was the plot, which becomes clear in episode nine. I won't get into it, as I would give too much away. Let's just say that the final goal of the conspiracy could have been achieved in a more simple and rational way. At least that how I see it. The drama in the first episode seems totally unnecessary. Still have one episode to go when writing this review. Looking forward. All in all well done except for the less intelligent plot. Therefore only eight stars. Will be worth your while.",8
North America,"From the screenplay to the plot, character building, and acting, it seems like the work of amateur filmmakers or, at best, a graduate project. The creators seem to be more interested in garnering public attention through poorly thought-out stunts rather than producing quality content. Moreover, they seem to have haphazardly utilized the ""popular"" concept of identity politics by having female heroes, leaders, and villains. However, they've failed to depict these characters with nuance or complexity, instead relying on the perspectives, thoughts, and voices of simplistic, action-craving men.As a result, the execution was lazy, uninspired, and typical of the male self-congratulatory attitude. It's apparent that the creators do not genuinely care about telling a story with deep and truthful female characters, but rather exploit the concept for their own benefit.Shocked that Netflix released such a low-quality TV production, which highlights the streaming industry's desperation and lack of taste.",2
North America,"I have been looking for a new series to watch for a while. Started a few, didn't finish them. Had been looking for something similar to '24' and 'Person of Interest'. As 'The Night Agent' came out on Netflix, I gave it a shot and I found it entertaining. Spying, conspiracy, cliffhanger endings per episode, suspension, gun fights, moles in the whitehouse, technology. What more could you ask for?Usually with series' now a days, the episodes get tedious, it loses its appeal and you forget to watch the remaining episodes. Not with this show.Highly enjoyable and I hope Netflix decide to continue the show into further series'. Has a '24' element to it, reminded me of the British TV show 'Bodyguard' to begin with.My only gripe is the amount of unnecessary profanity in some of the episodes. But, that's the level of people's conversations these days..",9
North America,"I watched the opening few minutes twice. You know that moment when you start watching a new programme on your own and then you think that your wife would enjoy it too? So you stop watching, and build it up to your beloved ... ""Darling, there's a new series starting Netflix it looks pretty good."" So you sit down to watch again from the beginning... suffice to say, of the first one and a half episodes, the first 3 or 4 minutes are really good and it goes steadily downhill from there. From the second half of the second episode onwards it might reach dizzying heights of dramatic excellence but sadly we'll never find out as we gave up. Cheap production values, writing and plotting have resulted in a sadly disappointing series. All of that said, I did like the gag with the wallets....",2
North America,"The series is not bad but too long, eight episodes would have been more than enough. After the sixth episode I found it hard to stay in front of the TV. Basso's performance as the FBI agent is fine and solid, if a bit naive at times. However, the performance of Buchanan, who plays the niece of two FBI agents and a specialist in Silicon Valley security systems, is too flat. I don't know if it's because of the script, but her character completely devoid of any nuance or charisma. On the other hand, as a woman, it's good to see women in decision-making positions, but it would be better if the script didn't insist on a constant ""you man don't respect me because I'm a woman"", which ends up tiring and showing women as witches.",6
North America,"Dear Netflix, Stop making a series out of everything. Sometimes a story can be told in a two-hour movie.It started out well and held my attention, unfortunately, by the fourth episode the story began to fall apart. There were too many bad guys, too many twists, too many implausible plots. By the fifth episode, I was scrolling through my phone.But the deeper the plot got, the less plausible the storyline became and the less off topic. Yes, I know it's a story, but it felt like different lines were stopping and starting and taking different paths just to lead to a very convoluted story. And the VP was willing to sacrifice his daughter? Politicians are slimy, but who knew?",5
North America,"I got through episode 1 and that's more than enough for me. The script is rubbish, it's filled with cliche after cliche. They gather up all the most used film or TV cliched scenes - bomb, hero, deep cover agents, car chases, shooting, a mole...and it all involves the White House. Netflix is having problems keeping viewers, maybe they should look at what they're producing. Does anyone read scripts before approving productions? And the directing is really poor, the FBI isn't going to have two agents standing outside a house, they'd be in vehicles. They're not guards at Buckingham Palace.I liked Gabriel Basso and had no major problems with the cast, the problem was the dumb script.",3
North America,Don't invest five minutes in the disgrace of a series. The dialogue is flat. Several of the actors seem like they are at a table reading. The storyline dries up pretty quick and the only thing you're left with is caricatures performances by stream Lee mediocre actors who have no business acting to be quite honest.Don't invest five minutes in the disgrace of a series.

North America,"This show started out quite well. A bit of character back story and development. A plausible conspiracy. An initial event to intertwine our main characters. All of which was quite well acted by an ensemble of a less than well known cast.Then we quickly start taking short cuts in good story telling that make any reasonable viewer cringe. OK, our initial survivor in need of protection does have a high tech security business backstory so maybe just maybe she would have some serious hacking skills. Still doubtful she'd be able to penetrate the highest levels of US government security.The serious issues arise as our victim heroine also develops a serious desire to fight instead of flight. Something the entertainment industry seems to default to these days but is far less accurate in real life.Our dynamic duo continues to infiltrate and access high security locations literally within feet of the bad guys but make their escape every time.What started out promising devolved into stereotypical triteness unfortunately all to common in today's entertainment.",4
North America,"As much as I want to give this a good score I can't. I loved the main actor because I saw him when he was younger. But I was laughing the whole time I was watching this. What is this guy doing that 911 operators can't do?! Other than get involved? He dispatches police vehicles and they take FOREVER!!! Then you get this ""high profile"" person to keep safe the caller? What was the point of this line? Then they're super aggressive towards the person they're supposed to be protecting. Like seriously? How is this good writing? I am still watching the show because I want to give it some time. But these are my criticisms so far.",4
North America,"Main characters(Gabriel&Luciane) are so charming and attractive. Loved the details of killers as well.Peter(Gabriel) looked so naive and kind for an FBI agent, but that's what it makes this drama so special.You can see how warm and empathetic Peter is through his eyes. Great acting!I was not that bothered with the storylines by the way, because of those great actors made me feel like I was at the scene.It'll be great to have those agents like Peter in real life, who's trully worried about his proteges, as much as his nation, tasks, and orders.Some people may think the writing is not that unique or twisted enough from other spy thrillers.However, as a person who's tired from too much details and guessing game, I enjoyed the drama as it is.Simple yet Powerful enough to absorb its audiences.Really hope that there's season 2, of course having Gabriel in it.????",10
North America,"I'm not sure what I expected when I started watching this. I wanted something that was interesting. Sadly, this was not it. The plot is not anything new. The actors are not bad, the series actually has some of my favourite actors, the reason I gave it a 5. Otherwise I would give it a 4.As I said, the plot is not new. Writing is mediocre. I think, I've been spoilt by European shows. The writing is better. The action is better. The storylines, in general, are just more enjoyable. Honestly, I really wanted to like this show, again, because of the actors. It's too bad it wasn't the case. If they do a second season, doubtful, I hope they try harder.",5
North America,"So annoying- could have been good but bad acting, bad script, bad plot, plethora of clichés (snake tattoos, sociopath killers, guilty children, sailboat sex, secret stashes that just happen to show up at the right time, President in the dark betrayed by trusted staff ) killed it for me. But my wife liked it so I sat thru it. I didn't read the book but it can't be as bad as this, can it? If the FBI, Secret Service, Police etc are as incompetent as depicted here then we are really in trouble. If this show was a dinner you would have sent it back to the hack chef. Don't confuse this with ""The Night Manager"" cause that is Major League and this doesn't make it to the minors.",3
North America,"I really enjoyed this movie! I watched all 10 episodes! Thank you to all the actors and producers! All who had a part in making this movie so fantastic! Peter and Rose were awesome! Peter looks so much like my son. Who is in the Air Force. All the actors were amazing.Please make another one for this summer.Even the bad guys did a great job! My family would love to see a continuation of this series,
I gave it 10! For great performance! Best thriller and action packed! I was really wowed watching this movie!I can't wait to the movie you make! Thanks again and have a great summer time. Be safe!",10
North America,"I am really enjoying this series, and I can't stand much scripted television lately. The villains so far revealed are two vicious paid assassins and they are in love. Or so the psychotic female character is, and this is hard to reconcile with her enjoyment of the murder of the kind lady who let her tour her home. At least she left the baby alive she and her assassin partner departed the home with the dead woman.I couldn't follow how the bad characters who order deaths like Door Dash are connected to the White House so far, but I am sure it is coming.One blooper was not making sure the door was closed when the agent left his apartment. I plan to also go back and see what camera brand that was placed on the bookshelf in case I need one someday. I might need one someday.",10
North America,"The plot is ok and the antagonists were just mediocre, but what made the big difference to me was the likable casts (fresh) and the 24/Bourne-esque style and pace of the show that kept me on the edge of my seat. I ended up binging on this show in three sittings.You'll truly enjoy this show if you can look past the cliches and the unrealistic parts of the show - which is not uncommon in this genre. The series ended satisfactorily but it made me want more.Netflix originals lately have been meh, but they got it right in this one.I highly recommend that you give this show a chance and not read too much into the bad review.",8
North America,"The 10-part series starts of with the Jason Borne vibes and carries itself with turns and twists enough to get the viewers hooked early on to find out what happens next. However, as the plot slowly unravels, the story starts to stray from reality to the point of impossibility.Functions of the FBI, Secret Service, and overall National Security are reduced to child's play. NHS (National Homeland Security) has no role in the coverage of the domestic terrorism plot. White House Chief of Staff is empowered to give assignments to the 2 protagonists, one is a civilian, and the other is a fairly newbie FBI agent to solve the terrorist plot without the knowledge of the director of the FBI or the director of the Secret Service. Besides the NHS, the Military Intelligence and CIA have no serious involvement in the case either.The male protagonist, all-American national hero prototype Peter Sutherland's (Gabriel Bosso) character is written more like a state trooper who writes speeding tickets on the highway. His feelings are not presented on his face. His partner, female protagonist Rose Larkin (Luciane Buchanan) on the hand neither looks like a hacker nor acts like a former million-dollar self-made business entrepreneur. But she is a firecracker and reminded me of Olivia Munn's character Casey Brackett in the 2018 ""Predator"" film.I think that they should have explored more of the crazed killer's character Eilen (Eve Harlow) who appears to adore killing as a form of art. The best acting comes from Hong Chau's character Diane Far. She stands out from all the rest.It's watchable and entertaining despite being so far away from reality.",6
North America,"Would have been better at 6 episodes. So predicable. Over powering blue colour throughout. Why?Another one that was written backwards to make as many twists as possible but unfortunatly everyone saw them coming before they happened. Another american show with container yards empty of any workers, bullets the go at right angles once fired and super heroes who are able to run away from soilders with rifles and not get shot.Set up for a second season, but not sure it will make it. For a guy wanting to go live in a cabin to suddenly go travel the world as a night agent and leave behind rose was a bit off.",5
North America,It's a really gods series with a lot of plot twists. The story is pretty gods. So I would say that this series is one of the best to came out this year. The start of this series had me from the first second. The actors are also pretty good at there roll. So I have to say that this series is so good that I'am looking forward to watch ist again. So please Netflix bring another season from this piece of art. The length of this season is also pretty accurate I never was at this point we're I think Dawn this Episode is long. The special effect are ok. The selecting of the location are good as well.,8
North America,"I can't understand the bad reviews. I'm not sure why people who watch a fictional show expect real life. This is a gritty, fast paced action/thriller series which keep you on the edge of your seat throughout. I feel like the people who have left bad reviews are the same people who are stuck up, snobbish and generally complain about every last thing in life! Live a little, this series is brilliant. It has everything you could want in a thriller, and gives nothing away until the very last moment, it will have you shouting from your seat and usually your guesses about the who bad guy is will be wrong!",10
North America,"Am I losing my edge? My perceptive powers? How this befuddlement could achieve a Richteresque SEVEN actually gives me disquieting chills. Why Ms Chau didn't throw a foot-stomp 'in T- Rex fit when they slapped silver-gray, morality - is - neutral wig on her is a monumental puzzlement. Talk about a spy movie with ALL CUTOUTS ! I'm all for actors getting work, but don't put them in manacles, dress 'em up in spy suits, put 'em in cars that drop out of the heavens, come with pre- installed tracking device, female assassins who can leap to OP's in a nanosecond,and pyrotechnics worthy of a Godzilla 1955.

North America,"The writing is pretty bad and the acting mediocre at best, though this is a fun watch and I did make it all the way through. Good for a weekend where you have nothing going on and need some filler show until the next great one comes out. There is potential yet falls somewhat short. Plot fairly predictable in certain parts, fast-paced sometimes yet slightly on the slow side other times. I've seen other people saying it's low budget but I did not get that impression at all. It seems like they could have gotten better writing and acting for the budget they did have. All in all, it's a fun watch so give it a go.",7
North America,The only thing I dislike about this show is that it's just 10 episodes. No moment wasted. Storyline builds quickly and effectively captures attention. I watched all 10 episodes in one sitting. I couldn't keep my eyes off. The cast is amazing. Enough action scenes and conspiracies to make it a true thriller and espionage tv show. I just love how the story is told and the progression. No room to get bored. It feels like something out of a Robert Ludlum novel. I can't wait to see more of this in the next season. I kept thinking this is the type of situation Jack Bauer would find himself in...only that Peter is much humane compared to Bauer. Absolutely loved every bit of it. Rose is a real badass tho. She wasn't made to be your usual damsel in distress. I loved that she could hold her own.,9
North America,"I don't usually watch American TV shows, so this was a welcome change.Currently on episode 9 out of 10.I found the story intriguing, albeit a little predictable. There were some funny parts which lightened the serious atmosphere. Some episodes were more interesting than others and left you yearning for more.I liked the dynamic between Rose and Peter. Moreover, it was nice to see the relationship between Chelsea and Monks improve. Maddie was a frustrating character at first, however, you end up understanding her resentment/attitude, as well as admiring her intelligence when kidnapped.I was disappointed with the use of almost constant explicit language; certain characters worse than others (Diane). It was unnecessary and headache inducing.The acting, on the whole, was decent. However, some characters were amateur-like, over-acting or generally annoying/boring to watch, in parts. Easy to ignore this, though.Recommend watching this show.",6
North America,"I came here really to complain (criticize?) most suspense/mystery/thriller series or movies made in the USA. THE NIGHT AGENT had promising reviews & a great, if clichéd, premise (a conspiracy in the White House). So, what went wrong? There are several plot holes & improbabilities that you don't see in similar Euro series.For one thing, to make the Senior character more impressive, the young FBI agent who is the NIGHT AGENT reports to the White House Chief of Staff!!! In real life, for example, 'Alex Haig and Bob Haldeman' were Chiefs for Nixon. I read the POST Watergate books and those 2 guys had NOTHING to do with Intelligence Gathering or who answers the Watch Officer phone in the basement. I don't think Trump's guys did either.We also have the 'Hitchcockian' tool of an innocent person on the run and ""you can't trust anybody--there's a mole in the White House.."". Ho hum.. These gadgets can still be effective if a tone of realism is mixed in. For example, if I hire an assassin, and he is only partly successful, I don't keep him around chasing the witness-- I give him a cheque & put him in a plane to Tasmania--I can get another guy (that no one HAS seen) to clean up the mess. I'm afraid that, if you watch the police-based Euro series, the writers get these details right from the 'gitgo'--I have viewed scenes of 30-40 street 'plods' crawling across the lawn near a murder scene looking for trace evidence. That's a lot of trouble for a 6-second scene just to add fidelity. It's hard work, but the Director does it. Sometimes you wonder if it IS a movie!In tbis, and other U. S. produced Netflix series, they simply cut those corners, leaving 5 or 6 plot holes in every story.Having said that, this is kind of a no-brainer fun action series, and the acting is great. There are just too many dumb lines to recite.",6
North America,"Well, I took a chance and followed the ratings from IMDB but shouldn't have. This comes across as a very low-budget drama. Acting was subpar for half the actors involved. Maybe the acting could have been elevated if the writing had been better. As one other review mentioned, there was so much about this series that was just plain implausible if not farcical.I'm no prude but I don't know why writers think throwing F bombs into the dialogue in almost every conversation is going to elevate the program. It did just the opposite for me. It dragged it down.So my suggestion is if you have nothing to do on a rainy day some weekend and don't mind binge watching, go for it. Otherwise, clean the silverware or drive to town and buy a new pair of gloves or something more worthwhile.",5
North America,Watched the first episode and am probably done. Violence in the series is not supported by a well constructed narrative. And it is not enhanced by a less than charismatic lead actor. Pretty but vapid. And the Deputy Director . . . What's with that terrible wig that she can't act past. The last moment of the episode was the clincher. The baby-in-danger bit was lazy and manipulative. We've moved beyond that in other streaming series'. There are so many other worlds to spend time with. This one doesn't move beyond the typical network fare. The actors here that are competent are totally wasted. Find something else; there is plenty of worthwhile stuff out there. But this one to bed.,4
North America,"Made it to the end of episode 4 and can't handle it anymore. Bad acting, poor story line, no excitement. What a let down from Netflix. Can't understand why it is #1 on Netflix. Felt like it was made In somebody's backyard. No real connection with the actors. I particularly am not a fan of the acting of the chief of staff. She does not play the role well and it does not feel believable. I don't feel like I am in the white house. I feel like I am at a local town hall meeting.The videography also is subpar. The shots and colors lack visual appeal and excitement. Really disappointed in this show.",1
North America,"Great show, inteligent, but without being extremely complicated, a classic example of a political thriller. The cast are all amazing and I found I cared about all of them particularly when some dont survive. I like how we find out the real situation about Peters father and if he was Innocent or Guity, and that Rose really comes to show herself to be an amazingly strong Woman as she saves Peter's life several times during the episodes and her treatment of Diane Farr in the last episode. The relationship between Chelsea and her protectee VPs Daughter Maddie is well written and performed brilliantly. One of the best things about this is the 10 Episode run, I loved 24 but this has the advantage that everything is much tighter, but with the same quality of twists and turns. Also, even though the CoS ended up corrupt, I still cared about her and didn't want to see her end up getting the full brunt of punishment. I do hope netflix commissions more as would love to see how Peter and Rose have a relationship, that is probably my only regret that they did not become Night Agents together but it could easily be made to happen in S2..",10
North America,"I'm giving this a generous 6 since it tried and there were a few redeeming qualities about it.Nevertheless, This was infuriating at times with the level of stupidity of some of the characters. There was also the incredibly impossible fantasyland of a world this took place in. About 50% of the dialog was insufferable and would have been better off if they just removed it and cut this series in half. And lastly, the acting, specifically that of Hong Chau, was like watching a lot of the acting in daytime soaps. Overdone, misplaced, or completely lacking expression.With all that said, it was still entertaining and yes I watched it all the way through. It was a good gap filler when there nothing else to watch.",6
North America,"This show makes no sense right from the start.Spoiler alert but apparently it's an assassination plot against the President and everyone around her is in on it including the nice Asian lady chief of staff who had been her friend for 20 years but betrays her for no apparent reason.But why go to all that trouble when they could've just poisoned her tea at any time?It's not like any of the other serous, high profile crimes they committed we're investigated by anyone.It would have taken 5 minutes reviewing CCTV for any cop to figure out that Peter wasn't responsible for the ludicrously botched train bombing and given him a medal for saving dozens of lives.Why didn't the Aunt & Uncle just run away when assassins came to their house?Surely the assassins randomly kidnapping a baby would've brought maximum heat onto them?Why was it even necessary for them to kidnap a baby?Why would a whole team of Secret Service agents walk off the job without getting relieved? I have seen volunteer lollipop ladies show more dedication than that.How did the assassins get the jump on the retired secret agent lady who was more paranoid than a weed smoking Vietnam vet?Surely she would've had a claymore mine rigged up to her back door?Why did they bury her body but not any of the other victims?Why didn't the neighbors call the cops immediately when they saw the assassins had broken in next door?How did the assassins stroll out of there while the cops were staking them out? Why didn't they call for a Swat team backup?And on it goes.",1
North America,I stumbled across this on Friday night and I am so glad I did!! It keeps you on the edge of your seat!! I didn't want to take a break from it to go to sleep. They did an excellent job making you think twice as to who they should trust and confide in!! Every time you think you have it figured out they throw another curve ball at you. It kept me on the edge of my seat!! Saturday morning I started watching where I left off on Friday night and again I had trouble turning it off to get some errands done. I started watching it again Saturday night and didn't get to sleep until 2:30 in the morning because I had to know how it ended! Gabriel Basso and Luciane Buchanan played well off of each other! I really enjoyed their chemistry! Everyone in this cast did an amazing job on this show!! I highly recommend this show if you are into thrillers and like a show that keeps you guessing. Looking forward to season 2!,10
North America,"1. Very little chemistry between the leads
2. The ""villains"" make Boris and Natasha seem realistic
3. Thoroughly unlikable Chief of Staff (and a wooden performer, in this series anyway.)
4. Unnecessary abundance of ""F-bomb"" variations. One can imagine creating a drinking game centered on how many F-bombs per line there could be
5. Amateur hour dialogue for-the-most-part anyway
6. Plot holes galore
7. Over-the-top performances from much of the cast
8. Are Government Employees really as stupid as this series portrays them? Well, in real life, probably so.9. All of the D. I. E. Boxes and more checked
10. If realism had been considered essential to this series, then disappointment is in order
11. In summation, I was initially intrigued with the concept and some of the cast of this series...but, this is a near-total failure. Just my opinion of course.",2
North America,I could tell within 3 minutes that this was going to be another immature badly written show. All it took was the main character to say 'I've got you!' to a little girl whilst rescuing her and it was downhill from thereLazy cliched dialogue trying to make a story interesting for teenagers(?) can't see any grown adult that would talk to another person in the way these characters do. Workplaces where normal rules of how people behave or interact don't apply.Characters are over emotional rather than interesting and I just constantly think they never represent the types of people that would be in these roles which completely undermines any belief in them.,2
North America,"Let's catch some serial intrigue and action, I figured, but this series wasted little time before pat archetypes gave way to trite stereotypes as hamnfisted misdirection left me wondering why a ""THIS IS NOT A RED HERRING"" subtitle wasn't employed to underline how little regard this series has for its viewers and their lack of critical faculties.Indeed ""The Night Agent"" wastes little time before thumbing its nose at viewers with silly little gaffes like a supposed ace evil assassin who holds her pistol ""teacup"" style ala Sabrina in ""Charlies Angel's,"" to name just one. Who needs armorer training, or for that matter script editors or acting coaches when you assume your audience consists of numbskulls perfectly happy to lap up the pap Sony Pictures tries to feed them here?I gave up in episode 5, just after our heart of gold FBI agent protagonist's gun went ""click"" instead of ""boom"" in the middle of a fight, leading to an inane hand to hand battle because the writers need to fill a full hour, don'tcha know, so plot devices like a federal agent carrying a gun that doesn't work at critical junctures and who neglect their training by failing to perform a tap/rack failure drill make perfect sense as that hour has to be filled by something, anything regardless of whether it makes sense.Many here clearly suspended disbelief willingly and embraced all the contradictions and technical lapses; if doing so floats your boat have at this mess. If instead you seek some sort of return on time invested gazing at a screen and prefer casts and crews that don't assume the audience consists of candidates for protective restraint, pass this one by.",2
North America,"The Night Agent is a solid modern ""who's behind this?"" spy drama, although it doesn't stray much from the usual tropes. The good guy has dozens of close shaves with death, and many around him don't survive.As is typical, it's pretty easy to spot which friends and allies are there to be the one's who don't survive.I also hate the Bodyguard love interest which no one can ever seem to avoid, including here. But I will say the two characters did seem to have a very good chemistry, and more than most, their affection seemed warranted. Also, they didn't try to make it overly sexual, but something a bit deeper connection. Good job writers, even if you did go there.And the relationship between the ""Hit Couple"" was good and entertaining, and showed a level of complexity that few spend time in developing. Very good job here.My biggest disappointment was probably in the fact that the final event was so dramatic. If it's not ""save the world"", it does often boil down to ""save the President"", etc. Hey, saving a couple dozen/hundred regular folk should be a very big deal.Solid 8, which was really closer to a 9. If you have limited time, be sure to pick this over ""The Recruit"", which starts out well, and becomes more silly in the latter episodes.",8
North America,"A great pilot, in the vein of the Jack Ryan series of movies, is soon followed by another generic, boring streaming series. Our hero from the pilot is rapidly turned into a useless wimp while the girl he was set-up to protect becomes generic strong female character of the 2020's why he just stumbles with befuddlement through scenes of her telling him what to do.Oh, and filler. This is a streaming show, remember? That means about 2, 2.5 hrs of content stretched over approximately 10 hours. So every episode is padded with boring, useless dialogue of backstory or relashionship, even between the hired assassins, until the end of the episode where, Stranger Things style, we get 5 minutes or so of real story that abruptly ends.The fact that this is so highly rated speaks volume to just how terrible politically-correct entertainment has become.",1
North America,"Except for the unnecessary excessive overuse of the f-word (that Netflix is famous for), this is a decent series. I would have doubled the rating if language could have been more creative. Nice to see some newer faces as the main characters. The time flashbacks to explain how they got to here can be a bit confusing if you miss the flash on the screen ""one year ago,"" etc. It's always a good story when you struggle with who the protagonists are. We're on episode 9 now. We'll make 10 tonight. If there's another season, maybe Netflix can increase their vocabulary. Profane doesn't have to be vulgar.",5
North America,"My 80-something father loves it. I would rather clean out garbage cans than watch this, nevertheless I'm watching it bc my dad loves it. Night Agent is not good. High production value. Good action (if you're into that; I'm NOT.) I've walked out of theaters on films like this. The writing is so bad it makes good actors bad. I'm not a fan of Hong Chau to begin...this has increased my disinterest in her. If you're 60+ and prefer movies to films, you might like it. If you prefer action to character development, you might like this. I'm in the middle of episode four and I'm about to fake a debilitating illness to escape. D*",2
North America,"This is really poor, but unfortunately typical for a run of the mill, couldn't care less Netflix show. There are far too many episodes for the writers to be able to create and maintain a coherent plot. The acting is abysmal - totally wooden and unwatchable. Netflix could possibly stop producing so much rubbish and put a bit of effort into giving us one or two shows that are worth watching. It betrays a contempt for the critical judgment of its audience. I can't understand how any reviewer can give it even a hint of approval. If I could have given it zero I would have done. 1 out of ten is flattering.",1
North America,"I don't review very often but this series deserves a special place in 'meh'.Gabriel Basso is surprisingly believable in a Jason Bourne-esque way and the plot line itself is engaging but, and I can't stress this enough, the dialogue is awful. There's so much exposition that it feels as if we - the viewer - are being treated like idiots. Beyond cliché and into the land of parody.Also, I've no idea what the wardrobe dept thought they were doing by dying Hong Chau's hair grey and pumping it with hair spray?!In the right hands this could have been a real contender with the excellent Jack Reacher series but it fails to live up to the premise.5/10.",5
North America,"I love political action shows so I was excited to see Night Agent released this weekend. Not going to lie, I did binge watch it in 3 days. I felt like the writing could have been a little better, but overall, found it really entertaining and felt like the plots were intriguing. If you like shows like Homeland or Jack Ryan, you'll like the Night Agent. I hope it renews for a second season! I also hope Netflix and other TV show producers create more political action packed shows like this one. I think it's definitely worth watching if you like this genre of shows. I just wish there were more out there like it!",7
North America,"I think it would have been much better if it had been 5-6 episode top. 10 was a kind of exaggeration. However, it is not bad at all.The production value is top-notch in every sense, there is no shaky 'home video' style BS here, which is fantastic. The male lead is a bit heavy on acting, not bad but not great either. The female lead is great, not because of her stature but her acting makes the whole story gel. All the other actors are doing a fine job.The story - America f@ck itself - is not new, to say the least, but have a good array of movies like that, Three Days of the Condor comes to mind first.It is a solid, slow burner thriller not to blame any other nation or religion but themselves. The scapegoat? There is always one.",7
North America,"I read all the hyped-up reviews and was excited for something good to watch while waiting for the new '23 seasons of the flagship shows to drop.Even the first scene had some implausibilities, but I kept going. After the stupid fakeout of a cop finding her in the closet (ridiculous!) was so unbelievable, I turned it off immediately, not making it even half way through the pilot.Netflix will most likely cancel this before the 2nd season, and now, might even want to stop releasing whole seasons on day one as a cost-saving measure, as most NF decision-makers would have seen how bad this was and likely pulled the plug after 3-4 episodes.Save yourself. Something better will come along soon.",1
North America,"I enjoyed how they put the story line together, but I would have liked a cliffhanger at the end. I liked how there were story lines of the bad guys in cahoots and then the secret service bonding, and then a little relationship building with the FBI Agent and the girl. Assassins also having a story line. Many great details in the script were enjoyable, but there were also some head scratchers.I'm a simple man, good action, not too much gore, limited nudity. Some unrealistic things at times I noticed, but still engaging. My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed it.I would recommend and I hope there is a season 2.",10
North America,"It's not perfect but it sure is engaging!No idea what the very bad reviews are all about here! Not all performances are going to be like Succession! Don't know why they were expecting a Emmy-winning performance from the show. Let's go with the bad first: the script is not perfect, there are obvious holes, but then, again in a show, like this, you don't expect to get that! The direction could've been better and so too the acting but largely only on occasion. The worst is The storyline to the contrary to other reviews is reasonably original BUT rediculously preposterous. But that is where the negatives end for me! Now for the good: the show is engaging and keeps you watching! The performances are decent and believable... if sometimes overstretched. However the show is well worth the watch and a decent step for Netflix and Sony! I believe there will be a season two, and the next one should be well, thought through with a better script this time, with better direction!",7
North America,"Was not expecting this to be this good , Excellent series , loved it. There hasn't been an action series created like this for a long time. As a fan of '24', 'Homeland', and 'Person of Interest', I have missed shows like that. This show is up there with them. Only gripe is the unnecessary profanities throughout. I think the beauty of The Night Agent is how everything comes together at the end , with a new piece of the puzzle being unraveled each episode. You wouldn't want to stop. Great action series, very suspensefulTotally recommend , despite some plot holes and a few predictable plots10/10.",10
North America,"TV spy thrillers are often silly and formulaic, but The Night Agent reaches a new low in that respect. The plot is implausible and incoherent, bordering on nonsensical. The acting is also wooden and uninspiring. Honestly 10 episodes seem too many to tell a story that could be told in fewer installments, especially considering that, unlike in the best spy thrillers, there are no significant plot twists. The ""villains"" so to speak are disclosed pretty soon (approximately half-way in Season 1) and the attempted plot twist at the end turns out to be highly predictable. Still, it is an entertaining flick despite being generic and forgettable. For better products in the same genre, I suggest looking at British spy series.",5
North America,"Okay, to everyone that stopped after episode 1: This show is REALLY good. For me i finished in one sitting. If you're a fan of Jack Ryan , The Night Manager , 24 and the rest , you will surely like this series. It gets better and better. Netflix totally surprised me with this one. Great actors , great plot (two interesting story arcs), surprisingly well-written characters (even the ""bad guys""). The pilot episode felt a bit clunky at times , but as I mentioned earlier , this show only gets better .And not to forget ,i really loved the naming of every single episodes which are based on the first ten minutes of every episodes..
Incredible idea.Can't wait for Season 2.",10
North America,"This is a great show. I can't believe all the reviews about it not being realistic and a misrepresentation.It's a tv show. It's written to entertain, not represent exact scenarios or actual systems within the FBI or secret service.Police academy made 7 movies after all, we don't believe that's how our police department are ran do we?Lighten up and enjoy it for the drama and the ride it takes you on.I wasn't familiar with either of the leads but I thought they were good. It definitely had me wanting more from the first episode.I will be recommending and hoping for more.I'm not a book guy but apparently there is a book so I will even attempt to give it a read.It is quite thrilling but very much an easy watch and bingeable show.",10
North America,"Looking for something new to watch after binging 'You,"" I came across Night Agent. I thought I'd give it a look. I've lasted for 6 episodes and checked out IMDB to see if it's just me... this lead actor is the worst I've ever seen. Maybe it was the lateness of the night, 2am that makes me so critical. Who knows. But, please don't ever give this guy another acting job.As somebody who lives in DC, I have to say they did a good job with the opening scene on Metro. At one time, for security reasons you weren't allowed to film in the stations. Anybody who lives here and has watched House of Cards can tell you all the Metro scenes were wrong in that show. It was odd that when he found the bomb, he didn't immediately make a call. There's cell service, even in the tunnels. Also, everybody who commutes knows ""if you see something, say something."" It's unbelievable that he's the only one who notices a dude in a black hooded jacket shoving a backpack under a seat. We always have our heads on a swivel, it's ingrained in us.While I was watching this, I kept thinking how much better this would be if done by British TV. They have a way of doing mystery, thriller, cop drama that is second to none. And, they can do it in 6 episodes.I'll finish this but it will be torture.Gave it a 6 for a half way decent story and good Metro scene.",6
North America,"The idea of rogue elements within the government may not be new, but the series presents the issues with fresh perspective and style.The camera point of view film method used for the series is called the Subjective Film Technique. The next decision made by the director was to remove emotional scoring that would influence the viewing audience to take a side in any scene. Only emotional trigger points are scored but just within the subjects scene themselves. Typically films with bad guys or terrorists are filmed in an objective manner, not so here. We are given for example a couple who are domestic terrorists named Ellen and Dale. The audience is left with an examination of their daily life. Their thoughts on living in a normal house with picket fence living. This can be unnerving at times. Unsettling yet thought provoking. Later, the script releases some of this tension finally by showing the audience that even these characters know they are mentally ill. Perhaps in reality we wonder, is this also a truth?Truths in any movie can be personal, and more so in this series because we are asked to come up with our own. We are not given direction. Not everyone is who they seem. Mature audiences will enjoy this intellectual examination for its neutral non-bias stand, others who are offended must understand its done for the purpose to see more angles within the material.",8
North America,"If you loved all the many versions of Tom Clancy movies and series, I think The Night Agent is better. And I loved all the Tom Clancy shows! Gabriel Basso and Luciane Buchanan are perfect as the two leads in this series, playing our heroes Peter Sutherland and Rose Larkin. The rest of the cast is wonderful as well. So nice to see D. B. Woodside again as one of the other heroes. Also, I am a huge fan of Kari Matchett, who played President Travers. I could name the entire cast because they were all fantastic and played very well together.There were several writers and different directors, but whoever the show runner is? Did an amazing job of keeping the pace not only on track, but very fast paced.My husband and I have gotten so tired of the slow burning (AKA BORING) shows that keep being dumped on ALL internet apps lately, not just Netflix as some have mentioned in here. This one is what I call immersive. You LIVE inside it as you watch. It is a wonderful throwback to the shows from the 90's which were mostly packed with action and never lost your interest. I won't go into details to give away any spoilers, but it is comparable to the Clancy thrillers of the 80s, 90s, and 00s. Not sure when the slow burners started taking over which the artsy fartsy folks love so much but us regular folks who are too busy to invest precious time into something that just drags on and on and never seems to get anywhere. But how refreshing to watch a show that is smart, exciting, and cohesive and while it IS about politics, it isn't political or woke, so everyone can enjoy it without the tripwires that make you move on to the next one, hoping it will be better.I DO want The Night Agent to move on. Move on to Season 2 please, Netflix! Nice set up there so if you are too dumb to renew THIS one, at least we got this one wrapped up in the end. Very satisfying. I don't like giving out 10s as a rating, because nothing is that perfect. But I tried to think of SOMETHING to detract a star from my rating and loved this so much, I couldn't think of anything I thought could have been done better. Maybe a couple of plot holes. But far less than I saw in The Last of Us! So, for the first time in a long time, I gave The Night Agent an earned 10! We want MORE of these and LESS of the foreign, badly acted slow burners, Netflix! For once, keep what works! You have blown it more times these past few years than any other app I watch! Kudos for FINALLY getting one right!",10
North America,This is a good classic 'baddies versus goodies' action series. I binge watched this and bought the book as well. I enjoyed the series despite the plot holes in some of the shooting and fight scenes.Gabriel Basso's character reminded me of Reacher. He also looks a bit like a young Arnold Shwartznegger. Eve Harlow reminded me of Helena Bonham Carter.I liked the non stop action and some of the twisty turns in the story. There were some annoying bits where characters behaved in ways which seemed implausible but on the whole it was a very relaxing way to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon. I watched the ten episodes and enjoyed it. I wonder if there will be another series? I hope so.,8
North America,....every position of power is a woman. Why is it that in most of these shows being made today the women act like men and the men act like women? Femininity was the best thing you ladies had going for you and you seem to be doing just the opposite. The President is a woman. His boss is a woman. Even the assassin is a woman. So I am sure if you are a woman of today that has to constantly feel empowered this is the show for you. If you are a guy like me I found it to be more of a fairy tale than anything that could actually happen in real life. ALWAYS find it laughable to watch these 100 pound women take down and beat up men twice their size and strength.,3
North America,"When the only actor in the cast that you recognise is Marciano, you know it's going to be a rough ride. The scene in the Metro looks like a back lot and the train doesn't look real. The only person that observes the bomber dump his cargo surreptitiously, is at the other end of the carriage and he works for the FBI ?! The acting is wooden, in fact it's not even that good. It would appear that no small amount of money got this up and running, but it's completely in vain. It would appear that nothing was spent on either writing or casting of the characters. In that sense, it comes across as nothing better than some daytime PBS potboiler.",3
North America,"I loved this series and binged watched in one day. All actors are superb specially the two main lead their chemistry.The action , suspense and thriller bound us to connect with the series.I actually watched the series two times, and can watch it again. I had highly recommended to my friends and family to watch the series.In India it is still in Top 1 position from the time it is released and in other countries also.I hope they will announce the season 2 .We are waiting for the official announcement for the season 2.Second season will be more thrilling action packed and romantic one also.",10
North America,"--Light Spoiler warning for anyone attempting to watch past the first episode ---Some great actors phoning it in, a script that must have been written by 1st year film school students, a screenplay written by a 6 year old, and a plot which is just laughably bad.Literally every spy/conspiracy trope thrown in for good measure, more ridiculous 'twists' than Shayamalanadingdong could hope for, 'hacking' where at one point the cybersecurity 'expert' tries to format an encrypted drive to access it - oh, a bluetooth wireless dongle in an air gapped secure white house FBI computer that is then allowed to install screen mirroring software? Surrrrrree.... The list of stupidity is almost endless.Added to all of this is the complete lack of emotional range any normal human beings would possibly show to the events unfolding.Don't even get me started on the 2 assassins and their ridiculous scenes.Which brings me back to the title - how the hell did this show get greenlit while quality TV shows get cancelled?",2
North America,"Just finished this, it wasn't as bad as what some reviews state.Is it oscar worthy? .. No
Is it a Masterpiece?.. NoBut, what it is, is just pure entertainment, Fast paced and no nonsense enjoyment.Offcourse, the acting needs work, 100% the writing was a little concerning regarding dialogue, but, who cares.I mean, the mission impossible movies, Condor, The Bodyguard, Reacher, 24, which all fall into the same bracket, allthough great tv shows, are not masterpieces.Just pure entertainment from start to finish, and I hope Netflix do a season 2, I personally think it deserves another shot.I give it 7/10 which feels just right.",7
North America,"This is a 10 episode show that will keep you guessing right up until the very end.The acting is quite good and the story line is solid. The Director allows enough opportunity for character development in the lead roles.It's not a big budget show but enough to make it believable and entertaining.It's not a re-hashed thriller like so much of what passes as entertainment today.As the story progresses, there are flash backs that will help develop the lead characters better and help answer questions about their motivations.Gabriel Brasso & Luciane Buchanan are exceptional in their roles.At the end, Peter finds out the truth regarding his Father.",8
North America,"The story line and various complications are handled well, tension builds, but really not an outstanding piece of work. A time passer. Guess the end scenes leave open the possibility of further development of the two leads' relationship, but it looks like a long shot with the two going separate ways to follow obsessions over their careers. Series 2? Doubtful.There is too much time and effort devoted to fights and shooting encounters. The basic plot that some folks on government are beyond reason and willing to take it upon themselves to do the reprehensible because of erroneous convictions seems plausible, and so does their manipulation by others with clear but greedy objectives.I think this series has a good framework and capable actors, but treats its plot to too many wrinkles we have seen before.",6
North America,"I love a good action thriller and this does a decent job of providing good thrills. The action is pretty slick, the characters are at times intriguing and entertaining, and the conspiratorial story leaves you wanting to get to the core of the mystery. At the same time, there's some stuff that will leave you dumbfounded. Dialogue can be silly, decisions or things characters miss can be goofy, and I rolled my eyes several times. It can also be pretty predictable. There were times I knew when a character would die or who the bad guys were. Even red herrings are fairly predictable. I also wasn't a fan of the big reveal and the motivations behind the main bad guys. Even for a show like this, they didn't feel all that believable. Overall though, the show is entertaining. It's nothing all that special, but it's an entertaining watch.",7
North America,"There are so many limited series out there today. Some are great and some are just terrible. I was so impressed with this one. It took me back to the thriller type movies from the past. It involved the White House and even though you knew watching it that there was some ridiculous scenarios and hard to believe moments but here they don't matter to you. You are glued to your seat and are taken through many surprises and twists.The actors are all very impressive and believable. Loved seeing the scenes where Peter was fighting and Rose, not crying idly by, helped every time and save his life countless times
I hope there is another season. It sets up well for it.",9
North America,"Wow! This was one of the best and most entertaining series in a long time. I love these conspiracy thrilling stories and this one was well done. Both main characters are great. The chinese lady I didnt like that much acting wise. Sometimes dialogues may occour a little cheesy and plain and simple. But the action and constantly wanting to know whats coming next are amazing! Camera quality, music and cinematic filming were great! Peter is very smart and likable and the ending is perfect in my eyes. If you like homeland, bodyguard, bourne, reacher, jack ryan - this one is for you! Its not that deep with character development like homeland, but for me it was the perfect entertainment! Hoping for a lot of seasons to come!!!",10
North America,"Il be honest off the Bat the acting in this isn't great and I kinda worked out who was the bad guy fairly quickly! But I did enjoy it and the below par acting actually works with the dry persona of agents and how you would expect them to behave, so it actually really worked well!Well paced series that unfolds and gains momentum each episode to a well rounded season finale, violence not to over the top if anything maybe a little more would be good, some of the hits would have been good to cut back to mid interrogation so you get a feel for the hit man and woman's sadistic nature but that's all I missed.Other than that great binge fest and will be extremely annoyed if they make a season 2 and cancel on a cliff hanger like Netflix usually do! It's really they only thing to worry about when picking up a new netflix show to watch!",8
North America,"Not all that bad! I was pleasantly surprised how much I liked this show. It has all the boxes ticked for me with decent cast, good story and mix of drama and action. Funny at times and enjoyed watching all the episodes. All of them. Yes some eye roll moments and bad acting from some of the actors (at times) but better than many other new shows being made. Main characters worked well together and had good chemistry throughout show. I would definitely recommend to friends as something to check out if they are looking for something good to watch.Finally something I kinda liked and did not feel the usual forced in your face bs... gets solid 9 from me!",9
North America,"This isnt a bad show but its pretty standard fare for a netflix thriller. The acting is bad clear across the board but the writing, well the writing is bad, no good, bad. Plot holes you can run a truck through, scenes that you have to leave all sense of logic behind. Way to much backstory for certain characters that are not necessary. The two main assassins they tried to horseshoe in a weird love story and it wasn't needed and didn't work. It was like they got 10 episodes and had to add a bunch to the story to make it last that long. It all ends in a neat package like these always do its a decent watch.",6
North America,"Mildly entertaining. Weak and totally unbelievably script. Agent is knocked unconscious but still able to chase down bad guy after train explosion and not one officer is there to assist.Bad guys have to retrieve black bag from home owner. Instead of just going in and stealing it. They keep snap an infant, pretend they are returning to their old home and end up murdering the home owner anyway???FBI director insists that agent can listen to higher level meeting, but then the agent just stands outside the door while they scream at each other on the other side of door.Agent is manning super fbi hot line, but then just finds time to aimlessly talk to girl friend on the hot line.Finally acting by fbi director and chief of staff, very melo dramatic.Ok to watch for simple amusement but certainly not worth a 7.7. Lots of action, some of it superfluous.",5
North America,"Decent acting for the most part.Otherwise, this story had all the things the viewer expects and let's face it wants.There are the perfectly foiled partnerships of the vulnerable but gritty girl who will fall for her good guy hero and the calm cool assassin with his ride or die crazy in love murderess. We got the blue collar hardworking don't trust anyone secrete agents. One dies. Yes, he was black. Might as well have put him in a red shirt from the start.Got the villain who thinks he needs to destroy things to save the world. Got the other villain who thinks she is in it to protect the institution. Got the other villain who is in for the money. Check, check, and check.The plot had all the spy secret assassin cat and mouse games and all the predictable conclusion. Even the dead-end plot lines were predictable. All to be wrapped up in a nice little bow by the final episode.Why did I watch it? Well I was sick on the couch. It killed time. It was binged. Slow Horses is better.",5
North America,"A spy thriller that's been done plenty of times before. Didn't read the novel, and now don't feel the need to. My biggest issue has to do with the acting, including the male lead. He was a cardboard cutout of FBI/Secret Service ""square-jaws"" we've all seen too often. And plenty of poor acting 'accolades' to the rest of the cast, except for Luciane Buchanan, the female lead. While we've seen this 'damsel-in-distress' character many times, Buchanan brings a modern sensibility to her role. She was the best thing about the series. She is in danger, but when she takes action it seems fairly realistic to the character.Someone on here asked, 'Why the bad reviews?'. Welp, bad acting, bad writing, bad directing, and MANY plot holes. That's why. I fast-forwarded through much of the show because it was so cringey and predictable.Watch Krasinski's Jack Ryan series to see something superior (although the current season wasn't as good as the prior ones).",3
North America,"Well, I almost overlooked this one and I'm so glad I doubled back to have a look at this. What a fun ride. Excellent cast. Great writing. Delightful surprise to see ""Martin"" from Super 8 all grown up and playing the leading man. Very much enjoyed seeing him in this role.So many twists and turns. Lots of mystery and suspense. Great action. A satisfying number of edge-of-your-seat moments.I really liked the performed believability of each character's experience.And of course, a good underdog story is always enjoyable.Well-developed characters you could root for or against. I connected emotionally with the characters, even the antagonists.The show had you going from start to finish. Was sad when it was over cuz now I'm not sure what to follow this show with, but the season had a very satisfying resolution. I'm definitely here for another season.",8
North America,"I was intrigued by the trailer. It did not disappoint!This is a really well written, directed, and acted TV show. A good one on the back of ""The Recruit"" from Netflix.This is much more grounded and realistic with your usual stuff, but that is what makes it a good political

... and now The Night Agent, I'd say this is a good time to be a fan of the genre.So Why bad reviews? It didn't seem low quality or budget. I really hope there will be a second seasonPS - I've only mentioned TV shows of the genre that are still running and not cancelled/ ended.",10
North America,"""The Night Agent"" is an incredibly engaging and thrilling TV series that will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The storyline is intricately woven and the pacing is perfectly executed, making for a truly binge-worthy experience. The show is filled with twists and turns that will leave you guessing until the very end.One of the standout features of the series is the fantastic cast. The talented actors bring their characters to life with incredible depth and nuance. Gabriel Basso's lead character, Peter Sutherland, is particularly noteworthy. He delivers a captivating performance that is both intense and emotional. Luciane Buchanan & Sarah Desjardins both are very beautiful & fantastic.The supporting cast is equally impressive, with standout performances from the likes of Fola Evans-Akingbola, D. B Woodside. Their characters add layers of complexity to the story and keep the audience invested in the outcome.Overall, ""The Night Agent"" is a must-watch for anyone who loves a good action thriller & romance. The series is expertly crafted, with stunning visuals, a captivating storyline, and a talented cast that brings it all to life. If you haven't already seen it, I highly recommend giving it a watch!",10
North America,"The Night Agent is packed with mystery, action and intrigue. It's a must see show which truly delivers an excellent storyline. Best new series I've seen in a while! Hopeful for a second season. This story is too good to leave it as the season ended. The lead actors delivered a great performance and for the ladies, Gabriel Basso is a refreshing new face which will entice viewers. He portrays a young FBI agent trying to make it in a world of corrupt politicians. His character is a bit green in the beginning but quickly proves he can do the job. It's an intelligent, action packed thriller which will not disappoint!",10
North America,"I thoroughly enjoyed this series! Watched it from start to finish over two days.Having never seen any of Gabriel Basso's previous worked, I was pleasantly surprised by his ability to carry this film. He made a for believable character and his acting was good.Initially I was worried it wouldn't conclude and I'd be hanging on for another season's release. Fortunately, as I've read, there will be an additional season but each with its own storyline which has a start, middle and end. This makes it far more worthy in my books.I'll definitely be looking out for the next season release of this series.",9
North America,"The premise of this show is great, somewhere in between Bourne Identity and Enemy of the State, so I looked forward to this.It started with great pace and quite decent acting. I could accept the small gaps in the writing, because the action is good. I also accepted the weakest link, which is in my opinion the two dumb criminals, who were really annoying and don't fit in the thriller style of the series (some sort of Harlan Coben style version of Bonnie and Clyde).What I really detest is Netflix's obsession to keep people stuck to the screen by streching the length of its TV series, leading to useless scenes, even complete episodes, that you can simply skip all together.This series would've been so much better it it were told in 'just' 5 episodes. Ultimately, I quit watching after the 6th episode knowing I had to endure another 4 of the same. Such a waste. Netflix stop with stretching the length of your series!!!!",5
North America,"I had originally drafted a bad review after watching the first two episodes. Please keep going because you will be in for a surprise, an awesome one!!The first two episodes of the series were completely different from the rest of the series...they were badly made, badly directed and topped up by bad acting. The only actor that had kept me going was Peter, the Night Agent. He carried his character as well as he could despite the weak script and the bad direction in the first two episodes. The series took a sudden and surprising turn from about the third episode. It was almost as if they had hired a brand new writer and a brand new director. The actors suddenly settled well into their characters and were suddenly doing a great job of acting! The story too took a great turn. I didn't know what to make of it. The rest of the series will keep you hooked and fascinated. So, please don't give up after the first two episodes.... I was ready to move on after the first 2 episodes and it would have been a big mistake. I am really glad that I hung in there....",8
North America,"This ticks all the wrong boxes. It is a very generic plot with all the usual red herrings you can see coming from a mile away. The acting is flat. The main character acts like it's his first weekend on the job. The assassin couple is nothing new. They actually reminded me a bit of the ones in Archer, but without the humor.And because the amount of actors is actually very low, you can completely predict who had an opportunity to put some spyware on a certain phone....It is getting tiresome how these series are produced, they try hooking you with a nice opening scene, that's where the budget goes. And then it just drags on and on and on.Throughout the series there is never any real tension.Unfortunately a lot of fake optimism in reviews to bump up the numbers. Anyone who ever saw any spy thriller knows this is mediocre at best. 4 /10.",4
North America,"And his name is Gabriel Basso!!!Gabriel Basso is going places, I'm telling you, he's great!I love the character of Rose too, she's a firecracker!!It's got a lot of potential as a whole, I'm not sure if it's the script or just the execution, but something makes it feel a bit B Grade.... There's some pretty terrible acting in this show... All of the villains are very terrible! The acting is anyway....
Story is actually good!... but I've not read the books so I can't compare it.I look forward to seeing if it gets a second season, I wanna see what the future has in stall for Peter and Rose. I like it enough to keep watching!!",6
North America,"I gave this series 5 stars out of 10. As I state in my title, take it or leave it. It's ""OK"" TV, not great, but not terrible. There are scenes that are terrific, and others that have me screaming at the TV.If I could have given 51/2 stars I would have. I didn't feel like I was ripped off and scamed by a crappy series, it was pretty good, but it suffers from what I call ""Lazy writing"" at times. Lazy writing is what I really despise in a movie or series. What do I mean by lazy writing? Well, the script writer puts our heroes in a really tight and dangerous situation or has them needing to escape a dangerous situation and they are able to do it without much effort. Everything that the heroes needs to fall in place that will allow them to come out on top happens. You need to escape from the White House when every single Secret Service agent is looking for you, no problem, just hide behind this wall as an agent walks right past you and then you go where he was. Be able to swipe a key card from a collegue in order to go in and out of rooms because your key card has been disabled. It's amazing how there could be a rogue in the W. H. and yet they are able to easily escape. That is lazy writing. Putting our heroes in the most diifficult situations and making the escape easy.The best thing about this series was the female lead Luciane Buchanan. She is a terrific actor, had great lines, and is a fresh face I expect we will see a lot of in the future.We have an FBI agent whose job is to sit in a room in the W. H. and man a phone that might ring. If it rings it means an agent is in trouble. One night it rings and our hero has a young woman on the line that says her aunt & uncle told her to call this number because there are men in the house trhat are trying to kill them and her. That's how it starts. From here on out we get the ""Reluctant Buddy"" story. Two people forced to work together who start off opposing each other. (Yawn) We have assasination plots, treason, murder, spies, secret agents, the whole 9 yards.If you watch this it won't be a complete waste of time. But it won't be on any top 10 lists as a great series. If you aren't a perfectionist, it's a watchable series. Just don't expect a 10 star series.",5
North America,"What's not to love about this show? Appealing leads, decent plot twists and good action sequences. Yes, some of the actors are annoying (vice president's daughter should have died for her atrocious acting), and the plot/scenes have some noticeable issues. The President isn't convincing and comes across as a pawn rather than a leader. Same goes for the chief of staff, the casting is a bit questionable at times, but the two leads are watchable. At the heart of it, it's entertaining. If you love action/good fight scenes, a little bit of suspense, and are willing not to look too deeply into the story, you'll love it.",9
North America,"Very entertaining conspiracy thriller in the same vein as Three Days Of The Condor. Yes he should have had more concussions in 10 episodes than a football player gets in a 20 year career, but we want our heroes to be tough and unstoppable. Plus it keeps the action moving since he doesn't waste time in the hospital every episode.Cast has some young good actors mixed in with veterans and character actors that help keep us guessing who to trust and why maybe we shouldn't trust anyone.Some of the NF series have been lagging behind the other streamers lately but this show is very bingeable. A solid thumbs up!",8
North America,For all those who said it was a bad story line obviously didn't watch more then the first 2 episodes. There is some confusion to start with but everything comes together and makes sense great writing to keep you asking questions and wanting to know more. Highly recommend watching it and trust me you will want to go past the first 2 episodes. Truly hoping for a 2nd season. Binge worthy watch each episode makes you want to play the next one. I don't understand how anyone could give this anything less then a eight out of ten. Watch it and make your own conclusions but I think you will agree it is 100% worth watching.,10
North America,Well when something turns up No 1 on Netflix I always get suspicious. It could have been a good series but this is truly bad. Acting is terrible. Where did they find these actors? Plot is full of holes and not very true. It's low budget all the way. I am very disappointed and even more so as they already talk about a season 2. If this is the new way of Netflix future I am very concerned. Usually they make good stuff but this is truly bad. They try to cover it up with even more bad action scenes that look more like an old James Bond movie then something made in the 2022. I think we are passed that moment of old school fighting scenes. Please no more of this.,4
North America,"It's a great stay-inside-thrilling-action marathon worthy series.The acting is really genuine with the two main characters having pretty straightforward differences but important similarities that makes the chemistry natural. It holds together their bond through out the story. Every episode kept me at the edge on my seat and ready to press next.It's filled with both action classic plot twists and turn arounds, but also more unexpected characters and relationships combinations. What I really liked was how you connected with multiple people in the story, not just the main characters!Give it a watch, I'm sure you'll enjoy it!",9
North America,"It's entertaining enough, I suppose, but only if you don't think about it too much or don't pay too close attention to it while watching. Anyone giving this anything above a 7 is out of their minds. Or they don't have minds. You'd have to be borderline braindead to think this is a 10/10.The worst things about the show are the acting and dialogue. Some of the dialogue is so bad that it physically makes me cringe. And when you have dialogue that is that awful, you can't expect the rest of the script/plot to be any better... and it isn't. Just so many plot holes and nonsensical situations, that I don't have enough time or energy to spend writing them all out. If you've watched the first episode or two and are hoping it will get better, then you might as well go ahead and give it up.",6
North America,"I have been involved in the tech startup space for years and loved (finally?) seeing a non-lampooned character.People who succeed in this space are often very smart, super-quick thinkers and tough characters. Rose was a perfect illustration of this.The scenes where Farr is berating much bigger men are great - worth watching again to appreciate how the camera pulls back to see the projection of her anger.As a long-time martial artist, I thought the fight scenes were well also very well done. We didn't see the shaky-cam that's made some of the Bourne movies so annoying.Much of the series is framed with moral ambiguity. How do you know you're on the right side of something? Does a simplistic moral viewpoint mean you let the country down?The pace was engaging. It could maybe have been tightened down to 8 episodes but I didn't feel it was dragged out. (My wife, who's not much of a fan of this genre, thought it was a bit long).",10
North America,"I have just finished it, and I am asking: ""What exactly was the Plot hey had to foil?"" I'm actually not clear.What it did become was a Maze-- who was a Good Guy and who couldn't be Trusted? Endless Good/Bad forks in the road.(best guess: if over 40-- don't Trust, Under 40 -- Trust-- but that is just a rule of guessing)
A Melange of a whole number of shows-- 24, Body Guard, Patriot Games, etc. Heroes having to prove they are not Traitors.Excellent, however, The Women are Smart. Some are even Experts! They take actions on their own, not waiting for Rescue. Finally!!I suspect it makes a much better Binger than a slow and steady-- which would likely result in becoming easily distracted.I wouldn't watch it for the acting. It was adequate.",5
North America,"My husband and I just binged this show over 3 evenings. Wow, this show was good! Oh, sure, I'm sure there are a few plot holes and my willing suspension of disbelief had to be activated. But I do not nitpick a show to death over ""oh, that could never happen"" scoffing. The pace was steady and fast, the characters believable and evoked emotion - some I was rooting for every step, some I despised. The action was great especially for my ""there has to be explosions"" husband. More than once I held my breath hoping that the good guys would prevail. The mystery of why and who ran unanswered all the way to the end. In reviews, I saw comparisons to The Recruit. That's been on the TV while I sat with my husband in the living room but it did not grab me like this show did. Nicely done!",10
North America,"It is a preposterous, yet interesting storyline. I enjoyed the twists and turns and most of the lead characters are good. I did not care for a couple others though. I think this could have been at least 1/3 shorter than it was A little writing could have been tightened up and some fluff removed. Decent job tying it all together at the end.I can't take recommend it but I won't say don't watch it either.I don't know why we need 600 characters for reviews. Is there no value in brevity? Is 600 the limit where IMDb thinks people won't post nonsense, but just give up? Politicians can set the world on fire with 280 characters but I need 600 to convey my opinion of The Night Agent? Weird.",6
North America,"This is a fast moving and fun action series that keeps you engaged. To enjoy it, you cannot be too analytical or expect any logic to how the events unfold. Suffice it to say that events happen only to suit the narrative and keep the action moving along at a rapid pace. Some events lack context, while others seem to be included solely to pad the script and stretch out the time to get it to the required number of episodes. The fight sequences seem to be very ""Kung Fu"" styled, complete with sound effects. From how the first season ends, it's clear that they are hoping to have continuing adventures for a second season. The lead character seems to be a hybrid version of Jack Reacher, 007 and Superman rolled into one!",8
North America,"""The Night Agent"" is yet another Netflix series that begins with an interesting premise, and then devolves into a frustrating and often ridiculous mess. For this type of presidential political thriller to work the action and intrigue needs to be at least somewhat plausible. If you stick around for all 10 episodes you will find yourself saying ""that would never happen"" -- a lot. The bad guys (and gals) are over the top caricatures, eliciting unintentional humor rather dread or fright. Thankfully the good guys and gals are likeable throughout, and the one redeeming quality in the series. There is annoyingly gratituitous cursing throughout, and a sex scene that no one ever, ever needed to see. Editing certainly was not a priority for ""The Night Agent""; this nearly 10-hour overblown mishmash could have been distilled into a couple of hours of relatively good entertainment. But instead what we get is a series that is really no better than the network TV dreck that we're subscribing to Netflix to avoid.",4
North America,"The acting, writing, plot and plot devices are about as basic as you can get. If you have never seen an espionage thriller before then you I direct you to the reviews that are singing this shows praises. If you have, I direct you to the ""honest"" reviews. It's about generic as it gets. It is the opposite of ""24"". Don't let anyone fool you. This is more for the person who thought that ""Designated Survivor "" was quality television. I finished it because it's in my wheelhouse, but it did hurt my brain. I cannot believe this is from the guy who gave us ""The Shield"". Surprised that this isn't on broadcast television. It ticks just about every box that currently passes for entertainment today. My Fellow Americans is way more compelling than this.",1
North America,"Terrible acting, especially the lead? Check. A Swiss cheese of plot holes? Check. Completely unrealistic? Check.But it hums and has action. It knows who it's audience is and it hits that right on target. If you liked Jack Reacher or Jack Ryan with some more speed and more dumb then this is for you. Frankly there is a lack of these types of shoes on TV these days.There are a few bright spots. The assassins are fun characters and Fola Evans-Akingbola is a solid actress.I hope for a season 2 or at least more shows like this on streaming networks. A little smarter with better acting wouldn't hurt.",7
North America,"It was intense & deep. Totally action packed political crime suspense thriller, that doesn't let you move from the screen, even for a single second. Acting skills of every actor was great amd within the role. Doesn't gets boring even for a single second. Like many political thrillers, it was not slow with useless table talks. A combination of political crime within the top institutes and full time action. If someone doesn't want to get bored, this is your watch. Storyline was great too, matched side by side with every character, and every Actor was in depth with their roles, great work!Something worth watching.",10
North America,What a GREAT series ! Binge watched and couldn't stop watching characters were excellent #storyline was great the ending was perfect you already knew you would be watching the second season but it didn't tick you off with an ending you knew you would have to wait to get an answer to. Good suspense good drama great action spy thriller. I highly recommend this series great for a show if you are looking for something to binge watch. The leads and other characters were perfect. Writers directors editors did an awesome job. I will definitely be watching season two and I hope they hurry up and shoot it. I REALLY loved the fact that they didn't jam transgender issues and other politics down our throat just an awesome show suspenseful edge of your seat goodness !!,10
North America,"There are very few redeeming features of this series. The storyline, though with a few twists, is predictable, the characters utterly uni-dimensional, and the acting is stiff at best. There are a few too many nonsensical scenes that defy logic and the action is trite and typical.That being said, if you are able to completely set loose any expectations of quality entertainment and are willing to sit through many hours of suspense that is hardly suspenseful, action that is mostly out of place, and sex that even Disney has a greater capacity to depict and deal with then it is worth a watch. If you, however, prefer good entertainment, keep looking.",3
North America,"I got through an episode and a half before I had to leave. The dialogue was everything I hate about Hollywood. If they had dropped 80% of the dialogue, the actors would have had a chance to strut their stuff. Decent actors but the dialogue completely handicapped them. Really liked Gabriel Basso. I think he could have been great in this sort of vehicle. A couple of the other reviews suggest that it gets better but not sure I can endure even though I do believe the plot/story line is worthy. Note to script writers: allow the audience to contribute. Leave a smidgen of mystery. It will be more engaging and draw your audience in without the 'I'm standing up now' type of dialogue. If the actors can act, you don't need them to say every little detail. That said, there were things I liked about the show. But not quite enough.",5
North America,"What is wrong with US script writers and editors? I'm serious they are all rubbish if you want an honest assessment of their ability to script on theme!This new series started off OK, but within 3 to 4 episodes it was back to the usual banal, human drama rubbish that every single US writer seems to think viewers want! Why is that, what do they think people want to see in a TV series, or is it as I suspect because every single piece of new drama these days has nothing behind it conceptually except a weak kick off idea, followed by a thin plot, supplemented by excessive character development because of the thin plot, shot in cheap motel rooms, at night and fake offices because of the cheap budget and the thin plot....!This is supposedly a spy/political thriller, but most of it starts to revolve around personal relationships.... the VP's daughter and her art teacher, the hired killers frustrated suburban life aspirations blocked by their job, the almost involved female lead with her FBI handler / protector, the female secret service protector of the VP daughter's ms nice gal approach, the old friendship between the female president and her head of staff, etc, etc.For crying out loud take away this rubbish and there's basically zero plot left. I mean some of it is so badly written it makes me want throw up! There was the stupid giggly teenager scene between the male and female lead in a motel bedroom in E3 I think it was that went on for about 5 minutes, then there was the what colour curtain fabric do you like honey in our white picket fence suburbia dream home scene between the two killers, or the my grandma pawned this necklace but my grandpa worked double shifts for 2 years to buy it buy it back but I can lend it to you for tonight scene between the VP daughter and her female secret service protector...... vomit, chunder into the great white China telephone, puke, gag...!Really and this is supposed to be serious entertainment?Acting is also marginal, casting is poor, few of the characters seem real, and most are simply annoying!",3
North America,"I wrote a review of this last night and my phone deleted it, which is just as well, because i may have been harsh. Grateful to have censored myself, here i go again.Rarely do i see a show on tv with such low quality dialogue and writing. Everyone is botox'd and most of the acting and set design and wardrobe here presumes a washington DC archetype, so we get unimaginative and cinematography of bland set designers. Every facet looks second rate, and that could be easily overcome with dynamic and interesting performers, but not here. The lady in the premature gray wig, who somehow THINKS she is stealing every scene, i found uniquely unqualified as an actress. Ditto for the frozen prune-face bald man, ""i am a dc veteran douchebag loudmouth who screams everything."" A lot of audiences might be fooled into thinking both performers are wry and creative, and maybe they really do have skills, but i doubt it. On this material, they are just plain bad and their scenes are excruciating.We have terrible dialogue and it is like acting students workshopping characters in an acting class, but thankfully, we rarely see this level of bad on tv. A Kim kardashian lookalike character named Rose had me yearning for the real Kim in the role...the acting would have been better. I watched the first episode and began the 2nd, but only endured 15 minutes because it felt like torture.I take no delight in ripping anybody's artistic efforts apart, but this show doesnt even rise to the level of TECHNICALLY proficient, i'm afraid. In several areas of industry standards, it seems deficient, and that is a surprising thing to notice when watching tv. Still a lot of viewers might not notice any of this, and enjoy the show in spite of all my observations. There are a lot of car chases and fight scenes and bodies flying thru the air and landing with a thud. People being attacked and strangled/hanged and closeups of their dying, jerking legs and shoes seems to be a mainstay/fad across tv shows nowadays in the '20's. Despite my brief viewing of this show, i saw it 3 different times. It's like the fad of the ski avalanche/snowblind/blizzard or sasquatch/bigfoot storylines across programming that i remember as a kid from the late 70's.The bright spot i found was the lead actor guy, who was the strongest of the lot. With more experience and an actual good director whom we don't have here, he will probably find the perfect role and really shine, but oh my goodness, i am so surprised any network would decide to air any of this.",3
North America,"I really liked this series. I'm usually strictly sci-fi, but I binged this in its entirety, in two nights. The two lead characters, Rose and Peter, felt like an awkward pairing throughout the entire series. He came across a little doofy and she just kind of seemed to be in the way mostly. A few of the actresses saved this show for me though. Hong Chau and Fola Evans-Akingbola played their characters well and really outshined most of the male actors. Diane Farr was the lead character, imo, and stole the show. She was fierce, powerful, unapologetic, leading, mysterious, manipulative and quite dazzling. I loved so much that they chose to have the character have that amazing and beautiful silver hair. Wowza! It really sealed the deal in creating that power look. The show didn't explore Kari Matchett's character (President Travers) as much as I would've liked, so she didn't get as much of a storyline as I think she deserved. This series definitely had me yelling out at the tv quite a few times with some less than par storyline issues, and again, some actors just weren't delivering it for me. There is only one book pertaining to this series that I am aware of, so I would be surprised to see a Season 2, but there is definitely another story there to tell - so hopefully they bring those actresses back to tell it!",10
North America,"If you didn't yell ""VANCOUVER"" at least once early on, you might not be in the right place.This is a budget production straight from Hollywood North, but it serves its mission very well.I'm doubtful there will be a season two, since it appears to be based on a novel and the source material is done.However, the characters could easily be used for another go round if netflix decides to make a go.---I won't say it's perfect. There are plot holes here if you overthink and dialogue is occasionally clunky. But the acting and action kept pulling me forward and I stayed with the binge for the full run.Leads Luciane Buchanan (Rose) and. Gabriel Basso. (Peter) did a good job gaining my sympathy as a viewer and their chemistry worked.Hong Chau (Diane) was probably my favorite character, given the ""is she/isn't she"" tension.Although. Eve Harlow as. Ellen did ""twisted and on the edge"" so well that she deserves a mention, too.---The entire cast took the job seriously and delivered.Yes, it's a budget mini-series. Yes, there are flaws. But I'm still going to re-watch it another run.",9
North America,"To begin, this isn't my genre at all. I happened to see a trailer and decided to pause my 3rd rewatch of The Last Kingdom to check it out.I'm glad I did.Though the plot is solid, the writing can't be rated ""awesome."" The delivery of the lines by all the actors made up for it though. The cast were chosen wisely. They were almost flawless, delivering their lines timely and with the right inflections and emotions.The personal story of Ellen and Dale really didn't do anything for me at all, didn't develop the characters and didn't have any bearing on the overall story. I just found out that this was a novel adaptation, so maybe this just wasn't necessary to the finished product.There was some rule bending, as there is with any and all CIA/FBI stories, so no stars off for that at all. It's not the first series to throw a civilian into the main plot. It was kind of weird that Rose caught onto everything so quickly.It was fast paced. It made you think. It was one of those series where you think you know, only to find out that you don't. I low key suspected Farr wasn't the angel that she seemed to be.I only caught one terrible green screen scene. Dead body, distraught partner/girlfriend. If you've seen it, you know.It was great to see D. B. Woodside (from Lucifer) in this. His character was interesting.Fola Evans-Akingbola's portrayal of Arrington was solid.Overall the series was visually appealing and entertaining. It was worthy of my time and I watched the entire series. I'm hoping for another season, especially when the ending really left everything open to more.With all the current garbage premiering on streaming platforms this one stands apart. Notably absent were all the forced tropes and sociopolitical jabs, making it a welcome and refreshing series.",8
North America,"I would have preferred the ending to include an invitation from The President to both Peter and Rose for night agents. A couple walking down the street draws less attention.If they were less worried about a season two, he should have gotten off the plain. Maybe throw in a pick up and twirl in the air and saying something like ""I was told to keep an eye on you. Kiss and roll credits.I hope a second season is greenlit just to see the duo back together.I binged the series. If were not up to par then I could have moved on. I enjoyed the show even ignoring several goofs. The Vice President resides in The Naval Observatory, and yet Maddie says she is happy to be home while being treated in The White House. Nitpick yes, just an observation of many inaccuracies. Still a good show.",8
North America,"Cringe. It's like the writers took every cliche, put them in a hat and picked them out one by one. The dialogue seems to have been written by a 5 year old who's just read their first Hardy Boys. The characters are wooden and seemingly plucked from the worst of the genre. The plot is as predictable as it is ridiculous. I've read some reviews expressing pity for the actors but they have no excuses as they must have read the script so had every opportunity to realise that this was one to avoid. Netflix normally produce great, clever series but this is just pure mince. Do yourself a favour and steer well clear.",1
North America,"I very much liked the beginning. It was exiting and as a viewer i couldn't wait to skip to the next episode.The performance of the main characters was solid. What i did not like is how quick the situation escalated.The main character (Luciane) that has never been in an environment of shooting or murders, survives an attack at night, a day after she picks up the phone and talks with the agent for hours, not only keeping the line busy but the transition of the movie genre changed very quickly, while on the phone i thought this would turn out to be a love-romantic story.The scenes of the booming and shooting were very unprofessional for a series that would be trending on Netflix.Missing shots 2 meters away? An explosion happening next you while you just had a gun put on the presidents head? And you standing up have a talk with your ""girlfriend"" and the soldiers let you do that... What? What was that?I don't know whether the producer changed while it was being filmed but the transition from ""can't wait to see what happens"" to ""guessing what will happen"" was not what i was looking for.Overall it not the worst.",6
North America,"Only half way through season 1 and already fixated on a season 2. Come Netflix step up and give us a season 2 ... and maybe 3. Great character development, SOLID action and suspense.This is by far the best new series I have discovered in MONTHS. If you enjoy cop shows, FBI and all types of secret service, good guy vs bad guy this might just be up your alley.Night Agent is a great popcorn and soda night out feel about it and keeps your mind active about who dun it and what could possibly happen next.More streaming services could benefit from more knuckles like Night Agent.Come on give us more!",10
North America,"The story was decent albeit having a few questionable plot devices. But the acting was really par at best with the exception of the lead female (Rose) who was good. But most of the main cast called it in or just aren't that good.It's true the cast were unknowns for the most part but it's hard to believe 90% of them were that bad, so I have to look to the direction, too.I don't mind an unknown cast. I they can act and the story is good, who cares, but in this case there might be a reason they are lesser known.So most characters were wooden while one over acted (the VP's daughter). Again, it might all fall onto the director.",8
North America,"The old patriotic formula repeated exhaustively of terrorism, attack against the American president, corrupt politicians and agents, shootings, car chases, etc. Added to all this a group of second-rate actors, several plot holes and badly done action scenes, the result should be the worst possible, but it is not. The point is that the plot in general holds attention, the direction is competent and we end up getting involved with the characters.An improvement on the plot holes and on some implausible solutions forced into some scenes, as well as a better choice of actors, would have given this show a considerable upgrade, but it's still a good pastime for those who aren't too demanding. The main couple of actors exaggerates too much in their acting in my opinion, they make a lot of faces, mouths and grimaces, they follow a hammy school of acting that I don't know how there are still people who appreciate it nowadays. Acting is acting soberly and truthfully, not making faces and overacting, at least in my view.But this series in not unwatchable, you can pass your time time in a good way if you like the theme and you are not too demanding.Rate 5.5 out of 10.",6
North America,"When you start groaning and then laughing in the first fifteen minutes...it's not the reaction an espionage thriller is supposed to illicit.The story line/writing is unbelievable in any sense of the word. A video game has more believable elements than this. There are plenty of shows where you have to suspend reality, but this requires not only suspending reality but removing it completely. The acting is wooden, and the bad guys fairly scream ""Don't trust me I'm a sociopath"" yet they easily get what they want, and of course have to garrote people to show the audience that they are really truly bad. We have a saying for shows like this, ""it's like getting hit with a stupid stick throughout the show""..This one is a log.",2
North America,"It's exciting. There's lots of action, twists and turns and on yeah, it's fun! Just go with it! If on the other hand you are a secret service, FBI, CIA, special forces expert or a wanna be expert, with a critical eye for all secret or covert US and World government operations...well how about you just watch a documentary or read a training manual or something. Anything you watch won't be real enough for you.Yes there are parts of the story that require a little bit of a ""well sure, why not?"" kind of attitude. Is that so hard? Really? Have you seen any of the world and US events lately? Truth IS stranger than ""Night Agent"" by a country mile.Looking forward to what comes next Netflix. I'll gladly binge watch season 2,3,4 ...",9
North America,"It was predictable and then unpredictable then boring- unrealistic. It took 7 episodes until both of them make out. Haha. Once you watch it you gotta finish it 10 episodes long thank God. Acting wasn't bad but storyline is so hectic and pretty much you can guess who the traitor is (the bad guy acting bad will definitely not be a traitor and the good one acting real helpful and trusting is always gonna be the one thats gonna f u up.) its very meh- i actually have 1 more episode to go but it felt like i wasted 2 nights for a medicore limited series. I like the villains though- good acting, got me spooked.",4
North America,"Fun escapism. Kudos to the writers and developers for not falling into the pitfalls of many of these multi episode Netflix type of shows. Maybe they read are reviews? First the male and female protagonist were likable, good looking, got along without spending a lot of time fighting about stupid stuff, and they both participated fully in the quiet moments and action throughout the story. They also didn't jump into bed during the first episode but after their characters were well developed, several episodes later, and in fact, they stopped making out cause of his wounds, and we assume that they did finally jump in to bed with each other, but it makes for a show that can be watched by all.Episodes were not wasted on hour long inconsequential flashbacks. At the beginning of each episode there was a flashback that lasted a few minutes. The flashbacks were focus on the storyline, and assisted the story.Of course there was A lot of implausible situations with FBI service, Secret Service, hacking White House data, etc. But who cares. In fact, after Trump's reign, some of these situations might not be that implausible. This was just fun entertainment. Everybody semi-knows who the bad guys are and the outcome, but it was still a surprise. So spend a couple evenings or a weekend and sit back and enjoy yourself.",8
North America,"Highly addicting! I love the plot to this show,. It keeps you on your toes.. there is alot to follow along with, so you cant just have it playing in the background, you really have to pay attention to who's who and what's going on, but that is what makes it good! I love the two main characters, who eventually start to fall for each other. Peter is super hott! Hehe..
yeah but it is a refreshing show, it actually has a plot, unlike most shows nowdays, they all just have no point to it, but this show def does! It is one of the top shows on Netflix as of right now, thats how i stumbled upon it. But yeah!!! Totally Def recommend it!",10
North America,"The Night Agent is kind of a strange one.Two main stars do try hard, fuse well, and are very charming. Their acting works for most of the time, although there are blunders every now and then. The filming, the photography, the audio and the setting is all very well done. And for a thriller, it has quite solid pace and very little of boring fluff. It feels like a quality product in most aspects.On the other hand, there's a big, gaping problem with this show. I don't know how else to put it... but that the writer of the show simply wasn't very intelligent person.A spy thriller needs to be spot on with weapons and tactics, tradecraft and psychological portrayal of people who work for the FBI, Secret Service, The White House, and so forth. The writer of such show must have deep understanding the sort of people who do this.And this doesn't really happen in The Night Agent. Most cutthroat, cynical, sane and rational branches of government, agencies, and people who work there are portrayed in some sort of dumbed-down, weird, semi-jingoistic and family-friendly manner. Sort of like show ""24"" if it was re-shot by Disney and rated PG-13. Everyone comes off as a clueless civilian, messy politician or a honor boy scout, while the villains are straightforwardly cartoonish and inept.Same goes for ""action"" - the guns sound wrong, the explosions are your classic movie petrol fireballs, the ""tracking devices"" have huge blinking lights visible from low earth orbit, the ""hacking"" is mostly messing around in Windows Command Prompt and so forth. It's also kind of amusing to see a ""hacker and cybersecurity expert"" spending days without touching a computer.And, while it feels like there's a lot of action, there really isn't, it's more of the ""oh no!"" moments like in ""Ozark"" or ""Breaking Bad"". Actual body count is extremely low and shooting-chasing is pretty poor, so it's still mostly a show about talking heads. That said, the ""oh no"" stuff is still pretty well done, so you get at least a good illusion of pace and urgency.Also, the people chosen to be cast in this movie all look *really* weird. It's like the audition was called out to find and throw together most strange-looking humans on the planet. I wonder what was the general idea behind this, some sort of misled diversity attempt? It leaves quite strange and cartoony vibe.While couple people who you'd actually expect to work in those government jobs - middle-aged white men and women - look so unmemorable that I couldn't tell them apart even after watching all 10 episodes, even though they were somewhat important heads of various services and such.Thus, compared to any other movie or show who got this cold, dark and professional environment more or less right - like ""Homeland"", better seasons of ""24"" or the movie ""Mile 22"", ""The Night Agent"" falls incredibly flat. I feel like just watching this made me dumber.First two episodes are kind of interesting, and then it starts rolling down the hill till the end.So... while it's well-made and generally watchable, it's definitely not brilliant nor memorable. It's dumb, family-friendly and campy like ""Blacklist"" or ""Designated Survivor"", with some of extra needless quirks added. Make of it what you will. A tale of mediocrity, I guess.",5
North America,"The actor playing Peter Sutherland is a solid actor and plays his role well and believable.Sadly he is held back by a disastrous performance of the lady playing the 'grieving' computer genius. I wrote 'grieving' because she never spills one single tear after the death of the two most important people in her life who raised her.Her facial expression is always exactly the same as if frozen in place; the entitled angry look (so familair in current day cinema sadly). It really doesn't matter which scene she has to play; sad, in love, happy, depressed; just 1 single look forever etched on her face.And then the plot and writing. Ouch. The lady, who needs protection because murderers are (for some reason) after her, is simply everywhere. She can't be shaken lose. Instead of hiding her somewhere she follows the hero of the story around like a spoilt all-knowing puppy.And the plot goes from coincidence via stupid decision to Deus machina via stupid decidion to coincidence.It's actually quite is disheartening because this kind of escapism is what people actually crave. We really need better writers and a main character that can actually act.That said; the majority of the supporting cast was not too bad. They deserve a better writer.Again; Netflix cancelled Mindhunter, a mature, intelligent show with brilliant actors. Loved by critics and the audience alike and decided to gave us this. Bizarre.",4
North America,"I love action shows like 24 or Jack Ryan, but the issue about this genre is that there are usually a lot of turnovers and sub-plots and action that might overload the public, which in the middle doesn't recall how they even began. On the other side, we have low paced shows like Homeland, which might be ""boring"". What impressed me about this show is that it has the perfect balance between pace and action, it only focuses on 1 issue, it has some action and also some drama so we can get to know the characters, so it's never boring and it's never to overloaded with an excessive amount of plot twists that might get the public lost. Also, it's original and interesting!",9
North America,"I laugh in the middle of 2 episode!The acting is so bad. The plot is the most easy thing to guess. I'm in the second episode (yes second) and i already know who his the bad guys and good guys.Its pathetic. Who in netflix board is approving thiss rubbish? Spending money like this on pathetic series that tell over and over the same thing: USA is in danger, secret agent on the run with a witness, the person that is trying to help him is actually the bad guy that dont want him to discover the truth.Give us a break please, looolOne of the bad the guys, enters in the room screams (after she didnt got to kill her target) and says ""i hate to loose"". Really? Looool.",1
North America,"The show starts off well, but then descends into some mediocre tropes and storytelling, as well as a noticeable drop in production quality in the middle episodes, like a low-budget, made-for-network-TV feel, replete will woke actors/characters.If you stopped there, you might have a poor impression of the show. If you hang in there until the second half of the season (perhaps the last third?), the show really picks up steam, with good twists and improvements all around, including acting, action, dialog, and even some special effects.This show isn't going to wow anyone, but does manage pull off a nice landing. Second season is already greenlit, and for those who stuck with the show, I'm sure you'll look forward to where the story goes, though it risks becoming a forgettable generic spy thriller.",7
North America,"The Writer of the show, Shaw. Ryan. Almost ruined this show with his ridiculous plot holes. They're really too many to list. He definitely bit off more than he could chew with this series. It has so much potential, though, and much of it was wasted with the unrealistic scenarios playing out in each episode. He had the budget, obviously, and the show is ultimately watchable, but you have to be willing to ignore too many errors to get through it. It could have been so much better, a top tier spy series, on par with 'the recruit' had they consulted professional advisers instead of Ryan doing all his researching of government security procedures on wikipedia alone.",3
North America,"Take elements of The Fugitive (distinctive tattoo instead of one-armed man), The Bodyguard (unlikely coupling of cop and victim on the run from bad guys), any of a dozen identical White House corruption thrillers and a smattering of Killing Eve (jolly music in the killing scenes) and blend until the whole lot turns to treacle.In the first few minutes, when the heroine's uncle and aunt (secret agents) are brutally murdered and she's rescued from the house, her first words are not despair, anger, fear or terror. 'But everyone loved them,' she says, one of the most idiotic, unintentionally hilarious lines in any TV show in years.Watching all ten episodes of this would be like repeat visits to a clumsy dentist. Even one will put your teeth on edge.",1
North America,"...then it's not a bad watch. But the Basso as the lead talks like he has a dip of snuff under his upper lip. And if Dejardines doesn't get into crying mode she is ok. But the worst actor is Chau who seems to be clueless. Some issues that don't make sense. The two assassins move into a vacant house and the neighbors don't call the cops even though the lights are on at night. I doubt the people left town who owned the house without letting their neighbors know. Then the assassins run around in the same car for most of the series without any cops being on the lookout for it since they know the plates. A typical trope where the spoiled rich girl sneaks out on her security detail only to be kidnapped. For once you would think they would find another plot device that is not so worn. Other issues--too much time spent on the backstories when they would become evident if the current timeline kept rolling. And as an ""expert counterintelligence"" operative, sort of dumb for Basso to hang out on his godfather's boat. Last one; with time running out and less that 3 minutes before the bomb goes off Sutherland decides to get into a fistfight with the bad guy even though he has a gun. Uh, maybe shooting the bad guy wn the wiser choice.",6
North America,"Half of one, really. Nothing makes any sense at any point, unless this has been written specifically in order to fill this up with as many clichés as possible.It seems like every other line in the script is a roll of the dice, with the writer(s) hoping that whomever is watching will be exhausted enough not to realize how completely idiotic all of this is.The pace is off, the dialogues are empty and genuinely stupid, the White Knight seems to be able to walk off 6 concussions an hour with no major difficulty, the Damsel in distress is unbearable, and 99% of the decisions the characters make are designed to move the story forward without any concern for coherence or basic intelligence.Half an hour of my life I won't get back.",1
North America,"Unfortunately, this isn't one of them. It started out ok in eipsode 1 and not to far in saw where it was going to start to slide over the cliff. I've showed more emotion when I've lost my car keys in the house then she showed after the death of this beloved aunt and uncle. Just another night I guess. Oh well, off with the hunky, cute agent.Where it fully was sliding down the hill....he's the Night Agent. Special phone in the White House to answer special calls for help from agents. Yet they can chat on the phone like they just had a great first date. Really hope nobody needed anything while they were chatting. I knew then this was not going to get any better. Give me MI, Jack Ryan and Jason Bourne instead anyday!",4
North America,"It's an ok watch, but don't have high expectations when it comes to the writing, plot , or acting.Plot is as cliché as you can get, but again, it's still entairtaning.I'm a little confused with the casting of the lead actor too, is he good looking? Sure. But nothing to make up for his acting, it's pretty bad... I'm not sure how he made it this far in the business, is there a nepotism situation going on or something?That being said, I'd still recommend the show if you want something fun and mindless to watch. If you start taking this show seriously, it's not a good show though, so depends on how you go about it.",6
North America,"The script was a lazy cliche of the worst thrillers, and wasn't helped by a cast that were mostly out of their depth. It reminds me of the cheesy thrillers of the 70's. And yet, I did want to stick around and find out how it would play out. As I suspected, it was very predictable. The script and plot lacked the maturity and creativity of what we are now seeing regularly in European thrillers. At times it was embarrassing. Cringe tv.The casting was terrible with some actors playing roles they were always going to be unbelievable in.I think younger audiences may enjoy it, particularly if they haven't been spoiled with anyhalf decent comparison from across the pond.",3
North America,"I watched the trailer and it seemed pretty good so decided to watch the show. I was pleasantly surprised how entertaining it was.Not a world-class piece of drama but just good suspenseful and entertaining, good guy versus bad guy; good guy trying to clear his name sort of spy show.I also couldn't shake why I felt that I had seen the cute actress playing Rose before, but couldn't put my finger on it.I finally came here and looked her up and I realized she's the one who played female monk Tripptaca, in the Netflix series a few years ago. I really like your character in the show and she's a hundred times much better looking with long hair.",8
North America,"This was a good watch. But, seriously, what's with all of the ""f"" word in almost every single sentence. I know people use foul language all the time, but it usually comes from people with a limited vocabulary and maybe not the highest intelligence. But these are supposed to be people with an education and who are quick thinking...and all they can come up with is ""f"" this and that??? It's just poor writing; it's unimaginative from the get go!!Most of the acting was good. I do hope they can do some creative work and come up with a second season. As always, reality was left at the door involving proper FBI and Secret Service protocols.",9
North America,First of all I can see it had a chance to be a good show. Who ever picked the leads did a terrible job. Peter is too much of a nerd to play his part and rose is not very good either. Rose is not good and should have been knocked off in the first episode. Guess they were desperate in getting leads for this show. I like the supporting actors and like I said it could be a good show with different leads. Good action overall and the plot is well written. Next time I will try to be more open minded about the acting but when those two are the leads it's hard to do. Bottom line if you can get past these two non actors you may enjoy this show.,4
North America,"If you're one of those people who consistently looks down their nose at others works then you'll probably do the same with this. If you need to binge something to unwind, or need a decent distraction I highly recommend this. Great pacing, has a real Tom Clancy feel to it. It never felt rushed or like dragged out. I hate when shows start feeling like work to get through, this was highly enjoyable. The ending was great as well, not a huge cliffhanger like alot of other shows, but I could definitely see a season 2. Like everything else in this world, everyone has an opinion, mine is give it a shot and form your own opinion ?? Cheers ??",9
North America,"Regardless of all the so-so reviews I enjoyed watching it. I was entertained cast did a great job, some of the twist were totally unexpected. Have to pay attention in order to keep track of the story line as it changes a few times. Good show different. Does not have to be real world, just hold my attention, just keep me interested in trying to figure out the who done it. Just watch it and don't be to critical... looking forward to a new season.Also I like the way the cast was matched up.I need 96 more characters to send this comment so I'm wasting space. Hope you will enjoy watching with out judgement.",10
North America,"Gratuitous profanity. Adds nothing to the story, character development or quality of the drama. There's so much of it that it's lost as a way to show emotion or drama. So much it's unbelievable. Especially in the first episodes the scenes are repetitive and predictable. A show that follows a tradition pattern is ok. The challenge is making it great and this show fails. Scenes mimick other shows, e.g. The shootout in the container farm. Really? Chief of Staff tried hard, especially under that phony wig, but she never became believable. The two main characters were very likeable, but the chemistry was created by her. He never got out of his Christian Jock role. I admit, I stayed with it and watched the whole thing. If I'd had something in reserve I would have quit, but it kept me from picking up my book. For season 2 I hope first for better writing and acting good enough to break free from the predictable plot line and find the magic of a good ensemble.",5
North America,"After 2 episodes, I'm convinced that the Night Agent is the product of a primitive version of ChatGPT. The plot is scraped from a variety of better movies (Three Days of the Condor, The Parallax View, War Games) and reduced to the lowest level of plausibility, and the dialogue sounds as if written by a robot whose first language isn't English. I do have to admire a commitment to non-traditional casting that would not only cast a variety of non-US actors as Americans, but have a Chinese actor play a character who'd never heard of pu-erh tea. A lot of the budget did wind up on the screen, though.",3
North America,"... but very entertaining and suspenseful. Of course we have seen some of the ideas and elements of ""The Night Agent"", but doesn't that apply to almost all the stuff we get to see nowadays? Apart from that, innovative series can be very boring so that innovation alone doesn't make a masterpiece. Despite some cliches, I liked most of the actors and the plot so that I think that ""The Night Agent"" is well worth watching for everybody who likes this kind of genre (conspiracy thriller/ drama). I'm looking forward to the second season! The number of required characters, by the way, has prevented me from writing anything quite a few times...",8
North America,"I finished the whole series in ONE NIGHT! That says a lot as I easily get distracted when watching TV shows.I can honestly say that this is one of the best Netflix originals I've seen in a long long time.Hong Chau is an excellent actress, she is amazing! Luciane Buchanan is a star, great acting and just effortlessly natural, the sarcastic moments between Rose and Peter are so silly and cute (I need more). I'm glad that her character portrays such a strong individual with a goal in mind that she wants to pursue till the end.I appreciate the slow burn between Rose and Peter, it develops so naturally. The little looks they give each other and how they make fun of each other put a smile on my face every time (I appreciate that it's not cringey). The scene when Rose explains old people in a restaurant is just so sweet. I hope to see more of their love in future seasons, just so so cute!! Even though Peter is the main character but having Rose really makes this series complete.On to the plot, the writers did a great job, it was truly thrilling for me to watch and I couldn't stop till I saw what happened next. However, I did find Fola's acting as Arrington seemed a bit awkward at times.Sony and Netflix, amazing job on this series and cannot wait for many more seasons to develop soon!",10
North America,"The acting is great and screenplay too. The way the plot unfolds is also very nice.I am disturbed about the directorial issues. Too many unrealistic issues that could have been easily avoided.Few examples,
S1 E9 - Why would anyone bandage a wound OVER someones clothes? Why would anyone have blood on their hands to wash off at their house, from a shooting that took place arlier in the day. As soon as the paramedics came, hands would have been cleaned...OBVIOUSLY.These are just TWO of the issues that are amidst a whole lot more. It is starting to make the series irritating to watch, while the basic storyline is great.",7
North America,"Firstly, I'm glad this was a series because the characters are so strong and versatile you want to spend as much time as you can getting to know them, where as a film it would be limited to cram all in.I've never heard of Basso until now, and I hope I continue to see more of him. I really enjoyed his performance of Peter. He delivers this character with a mix of strength and sensitivity. He is a charachter you know deserves more than the cards he's being dealt, and your kinda glad the phone that is never suppose to ring, rings on bi's shift because you know that's when things are going to get exciting.I also really enjoyed Hong chau's character Diane, who is a mighty powerhouse, with a sharp tongue and a woman who has it all together..or so you think. Buchanans charachter Rose, was so refreshing to see.I like that they casted a petite woman with dark hair as opposed to the usual leads of a white blonde hair woman, which can get a tad boring.Her charachterr is also strong. The fact that she is CEO of a computer company, and is rather technical puts a fresh new twist on the female lead, rather than just being the damsel who is saved in every situation by the man, they both equally save eachother in messy scenarios that they encounter along the way.It reminds me of noughties action blockbusters days that I thought where long gone in this day and age of TV. I feel it likened to Will Smith in Enemy of the state or Chris Evans in Cellular but with it respectively being its own unique show.The stunts are great, lots of shooting, glass smashing and high speed car chases. And even though its set in D. C. i feel like this journey took them all around the country, from being in car chases in suburban city areas to on foot getaways in the woodland, then fighting sequences taking place in derelict yards. Jumping from one location to another really helps with the electric pace of this series. Theirs no way you could press pause and save and continue watching for another day. It's all in to the end, even If you sacrifice your sleep.",9
North America,"""The Night Agent"" is a television series that promises an action-packed thriller with a story that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Unfortunately, it falls short of those expectations with a mediocre storyline that most of the time does not make sense. The show revolves around an FBI agent who discovers a conspiracy involving the White House key staff and FBI director that threatens to undermine the United States' security.The show's premise is intriguing. However, the execution of the storyline leaves much to be desired. The plot is often convoluted and confusing, with many of the events not making sense or seeming to come out of nowhere. The writing seems rushed and poorly thought out, leaving the viewer feeling unsatisfied with the resolution of many of the story's threads.One of the most significant issues with the show is the acting. Unfortunately, most of the cast's performances are underwhelming, with little nuance or depth to their portrayals. The actors' inability to convey the emotional weight of the situations they find themselves in leaves the show feeling flat and unengaging. Many of the actors' line deliveries feel wooden and stilted, making it difficult to become invested in the characters' fates.There are a few standout performances, however. Eve Harlow, who plays the psycho villain, delivers an engaging and convincing portrayal of a woman on the brink of madness. Her performance stands out as one of the few bright spots in an otherwise lackluster cast. Unfortunately, her character is not enough to carry the show on its own.Another issue with ""The Night Agent"" is its pacing. The show moves at a breakneck speed, often jumping from one plot point to the next without giving the viewer time to process what's happening. The result is a show that feels disjointed and rushed, leaving the viewer feeling unsatisfied and confused.Despite its flaws, ""The Night Agent"" does have some redeeming qualities. The show's action sequences are well-executed and exciting, providing some much-needed energy to the series. The fight scenes are choreographed well, and the cinematography is solid, making these moments some of the most enjoyable in the show.In conclusion, ""The Night Agent"" is a show that promises an action-packed thriller but ultimately falls short of those expectations. Its mediocre storyline and poor acting make it difficult to become invested in the characters or the plot. While there are some standout moments, they are not enough to save the show from feeling disjointed and rushed. If you're looking for a fast-paced action series, ""The Night Agent"" may be worth a watch, but if you're looking for a well-written and well-acted thriller, there are better options out there.",6
North America,"Some good entertainment in this series, but some terrible acting let it down, Diane Farr is so unbelievable it's bizarre, probably not the actress fault as she is dressed up like a Bond villain , as long you can shut that out of your mind it bumbles along in a good misdirection kinda way with you second guessing what's going on. Def worth a watch , and some really good characters in the rest of the cast especially ""Agent Monks"" he should have a series all of his own :)
The lead characters are good and certainly stand out to make the story believable and exciting enough, just a shame some production decisions seem to let it down.",8
North America,"This movie is all about our beloved government being very bad. There are spies everywhere and no one can be trusted. It's the deep state plotting to overthrow others within the government. Although many movies have had a similar theme, there's a different story here to enjoy and appreciate. Photography is great, watch DC in low light, cloudy most time, it's as if you are there with the characters. Coming to characters all are almost unknown. Despite the great story and having Sony pictures in the production, the budget must have been sufficiently low to prevent recruiting of good actors. The lead female character Lucianne Buchanan looks abnormal, with large eyes almost like she has thyroid problems. You'll have to tolerate her looks through out the 10 episodes. The male lead Gabriel Basso also not well known performs very well.",7
North America,"The plot is not unique. From the very beginning, the series reminded me of Apple Thriller Series 'Slow Horses'. It was good to see that the genre is now shifting to it's attention to domestic terrorists. Definitely a slight turn against framing foreign lands and people as criminals in the post 9/11 security paradigm. A Muslim terrorist was there, by the way. The series started on a wrong foot - the bomber was wearing a hoodie. I mean, come on. How hard it was to debunk the common myth that people wearing hoodies are suspicious? The weakest part of the whole series was President's Chief of Staff Dianne Farr and the President herself. Farr had a central role to play and she enjoyed so much screen time. Yet her expression was mostly bland and robotic. Of the ten episodes, she only did well in two scenes. It was painful to watch. And Farr's character was developed poorly too. As the Chief of Staff of the President of the United States, she seemed to have no busyness at all. Same goes for the president. Could be much more better. The main actor, actress, and VP's daughter stole the show. As I said it was a good blend of good and bad actors.",9
North America,"There is so much wrong with this show. Terrible plot with so many impossibilities and dumb behavior (like an FBI agent trying to use the elevator when the power is out...honestly). The dialogue is extremely flat and so is the actors' delivery. Everyone talks in monotone, it's almost comical. It's a shame that Netflix keeps trying to make new shows and cancels existing ones that actually have something to them. I was shocked to find so many 10/10 reviews here but everyone's entitled to their opinion. This is mine. Please save yourself the 10 hours and do not watch. I had to stop midway through episode 4.",2
North America,"I think the show was put together really well. The actors in the leading roles appeared to be natural in their characters, probably what made the show work. The writing may steer things a little too conveniently for the path they want it to go, but definitely not more so than many long running shows. And the corny lines are very minimal, which is an anomaly now days.Overall, it hits in an area where shows have been lacking recently. If only it moves into the 2nd season keeping a similar feel and does not try to over do itself or reach too far to keep all the same characters it will be a strong show for some time to come.",9
North America,"'The Night Agent' is a thrilling and dramatic series that will keep you on the edge of your seat. The show follows FBI agent Peter Sutherland as he investigates a complex conspiracy that threatens to destabilize the US government. The lead actor delivers an excellent performance, portraying Peter as a determined and capable agent who is willing to take risks to get the job done.While the show is primarily a thriller with plenty of action scenes and plot twists, it also includes elements of drama that add emotional weight to the story. From the personal struggles of the characters to the high stakes of the investigation, 'The Night Agent' keeps you invested in the story and the fates of its characters. Overall, it's a must-watch for fans of the thriller and drama genres, and a great choice for anyone looking for a well-written and well-acted series on Netflix.",10
North America,"This could have been a great action story, but the acting is so bad it is distracting. The lines are delivered woodenly and without any believability. The only ones that deliver at all are Eve Harlow as Ellen. The worst is Hong Chau as Diane Farr, who must be the most boring actress I've watched in a long time. She gives al her lines completely deadpan. Boring. You really have to suspend belief to watch it, since the ridiculousness of the plot holes are too numerous to count. Too bad, it could have been an interesting show if they had just tried a little harder. I watch shows to be entertained, and normally don't care about plot angles, but this show is just silly.",4
North America,"Netflix series. In a world where we can't trust anyone, rose calls the hotline that's reserved for undercover fbi operatives or informants. She's on the run, when her aunt and uncle are knocked off. And so far, she only trusts peter and his direct boss agent farr. Everyone else is a question mark. Who is bombing random subways? They hide. And run. And try to clear their own names. But of course, the people they thought they could trust ...are trying to frame them. Where can they go? And the conspiracy goes all the way to the white house. Good suspense! And according to several sites, it will be renewed for another set of episodes. Good stuff! Gabriel basso, luciane buchanan. Definitely worth watching.",8
North America,"There has been such a minimal amount of good shows ever since COVID. I didn't go into this show with high expectations. I thought it would be low quality, slow, nothing to remember, but I was pleasantly surprised! It's not necessarily a high caliber series, but it's very entertaining. Not a single episode fell flat or was slow/boring. It was high paced and kept you guessing. Don't go in expecting it to compare to the best series of the year, but it's wonderful in its own category. I loved the mystery, action, and storyline. There were so many times I expected the ""villain"" to be X, and then I would second guess myself. Figuring out the puzzle was the best part. Highly recommend binging this on your off day!",8
North America,"I'll try and do this without spoiling anything, but the main message here is that this is show is unsuccessfully trying to capitalize on the success of shows like Jack Ryan and Reacher. The first few episodes start out by giving you enough mystery and intrigue to be engaged (if you suspend some disbelief and logic) but ultimately the show gets a bit ridiculous.While there are some good characters (the main duo is fun to watch, has good chemistry, and you really root for them) at some point the writing goes a bit off the rails and becomes pretty unbelievable. Basically, the writer or writers of this show are good at dialogue writing but not very good at fleshing out the big picture logic and circumstance that would make this a good spy thriller.I am basically just posting this review to say I would not recommend starting this because it has a decent enough of a hook to keep you watching and the payoff really isn't worth it. Around episode 7 things start to get really unbelievable and that continues throughout the rest of the series. Pretty well made though with some decent acting, storylines, and dialogue. Just the motivations of the characters are very one-sided and not fleshed out at all, and a lot of it simply does not make any sense.",7
North America,"I'm four episodes in and hooked - The Night Agent is a proper thriller - good action, good tension, characters you get to know and a well concealed motive behind the shady dealings of some people who are clearly utterly ruthless.It all adds up to a satisfying action spy thriller - more Jack Ryan than Slow Horses - definitely a good watch that will lift your adrenaline levels.With six episodes to go I imagine there are still quite a few surprises to be had before things become clear and we know who's doing what, and where and why.At the core of what makes the show work is the time spent allowing characters to communicate - this isn't just about short 15 to 20 second scenes that establish no real continuity and don't allow us to get to know the characters - and the dialogue is pretty good, the script has been well worked on.Coupled with this, a great ensemble, high production values (including some good stunt work), slick cinematography.A well deserved 8.",8
North America,"Yes in parts it's a little cliched, however this has definitely gone under the radar.It's a great watch from the outset with plenty of twists and turns along the way. It's a rollercoaster from the outset with bangs, high action, mystery and deceit.It's one of those shows, that should a season 2 that is equally as good, this is going to pick up major traction.It's got no actors that jump out as being ""major"" when you look at the cast list. Again, don't let that put you off. I'd imagine some of them will star in other shows, which will again lead people back to watching this.All in all, a solid 9/10.",9
North America,"Really enjoyed the show. Kept moving and the performances were solid. I did do a double take when the ""former navy seal"" couldn't do a believable crawl through the pool. It was the first unbelievable moment i caught. Otherwise, anything from Sean Ryan gonna get my attention. He's created some great shows, as have the writers that came up on his vehicles. He is a guy I'd watch anytime. The Shield is one of my favorites. They used a few of Ryan's Directors on this show. If Adam Arkin is directing, and he is, you know the scripts are good. Again?, I'm glad I found it. The talent is strong. DB Woodside is a great actor, love his work. He can do it all.",8
North America,"If you're a fan of action-packed, suspenseful shows, then ""The Night Agent"" on Netflix is a must-watch. Based on the character Peter, this new show is a total 10/10 in my books.From the very first episode, ""The Night Agent"" had me on the edge of my seat. The plot is gripping, with plenty of twists and turns that keep you guessing until the very end. I won't give anything away, but let's just say that Peter's character goes through some intense experiences that make for incredibly exciting viewing.The action sequences in this show are also top-notch. I was blown away by the fight scenes, which are choreographed to perfection. Each one is so well-executed that I felt like I was right there in the middle of the action.But ""The Night Agent"" isn't all about action. There's also a lot of suspense and mystery that keeps you hooked. As the plot unfolds, you're constantly left wondering who to trust and what's really going on behind the scenes. This is the kind of show that keeps you up late at night, trying to figure out what's going to happen next.Overall, I have to say that ""The Night Agent"" is a total winner. If you're a fan of action, suspense, and mystery, then this is definitely a show you won't want to miss. It's a 10/10 in my books.",10
North America,"The first five episodes are frustratingly generic, with one-dimensional stock genre characters and a bag of cliches. The writing was poor, with the FBI trained protagonist showing little security consciousness and surviving through pure luck.Actually the only refreshing element that offers something different is the love story between the assassins.The female characters are particularly poorly drawn - the female lead, the Secret Service agent, and the VP's daughter in particular - where arrogance and rudeness seem to substitute for strength and sass; they behave like entitled teenagers and are plain unlikeable.Thank goodness for Oscar-nominated actress Hong Chau, who transforms herself yet again and brings some class to the proceedings.From episode 6 the action picks up pace and the characters start to become more fleshed out (a bit late), and the show becomes more engaging (and less annoying).There's not much chemistry between the two leads, so the romance side plot seems a bit forced (the assassins romance is better!).The show seems to have done well. So if there's a second season, hope it continues to improve, particularly on the writing.",6
North America,"The Night Agent is an incredibly disappointing TV series that fails to deliver on its potential. The show is a jumbled mess of uninteresting characters, stilted dialogue, and confusing plotlines that make it difficult to follow. There is no clear direction, and the story seems to ramble on without any real purpose or meaning.The acting in this show is subpar, with wooden performances and very little chemistry between the characters. The main character is particularly bland, lacking any real depth or complexity. The supporting cast doesn't fare any better, and their performances feel forced and uninspired.The most frustrating thing about The Night Agent is that it had the potential to be great. The premise was intriguing, and the show had a lot of promise. However, the execution falls short, and it ends up feeling like a wasted opportunity. The pacing is slow, and the story seems to drag on endlessly without any real payoff.Overall, The Night Agent is a forgettable TV show that is not worth your time. There are better options out there if you're looking for a well-crafted and engaging thriller.",1
North America,"It's ok.Show a sequence of fat32 formatting an encrypted drive then proclaiming ""this is super spy levels of encryption, we need a super computer to break in to it"".. The tech consult should be fired. A tiny video camera with unlimited battery. NSA up the wazoo level assassination of high level governmental family members, but no satellite tracking.Also what's with all the lisps?!Rose, the female assassin, the chief of staff, the VPs daughter... Why can no one speak in this show, it's like their jaws are weird shut?There's an awful lot of boss babes in this one.I'm starting to have to skip ahead frequently just to see what happens.",6
North America,"Basso and Buchanan must be very good actors to manage the poorly written dialogue the way they do, though I do think the supporting characters have the most expository and cliched dialogue to work with, so that may be unfair. That said, despite the ridiculousness of the storyline and the headache-inducing dialogue, the story is really compelling. I find myself very interested in seeing what happens next. It's a good, entertaining show that would benefit greatly from a dialogue coach and a good writer to tune it up.I'd also tone down the random bursts of profanity that seem dropped in for no reason and don't mesh with the characters who use it. They also need better wigs. Fake hair is distracting.",7
North America,"By modern standards this show isn't horribly. To be clear, I'm not saying this is a great show, but considering the state of the modern entertainment industry, it's watchable. The writing is barely passable, although the characters are all cliché and the plot is predictable. It's more like rewatching a show you've already seen instead of watching something new. The acting and directing are acceptable, not great, but acceptable. There's too much sex and violence. I think writers fall back on those tropes when they can't think of anything else. They didn't have enough story to fill up the episodes so they threw in a few fights and some sex to fill in time. If you are looking for something mindless to watch while you play a video game, this show is an acceptable option.",3
North America,"I'll keep this simple, smart ass girl try to take everything under control, and the agent that god know why he is not that professional. Wandering around just like another american series that put too much addtional story. Make it a series maybe to much for a story that actually able to pack it in less episode or just make it movie.The action good, the pace quite good. The story good also for the first 2 episode. The mistery and reason that keept secret and slowly open up is good point from me.Lol the agent that suppose to be invincible turns out just like another kid with daddy issues.Too much drama for anyone that expect pure action and mistery for a really secret plot story.",6
North America,"Every single male in this show is talked down to in all dialogues. Every single person in charge is you guessed it .. a female. The storyline is pretty interesting though, enough so, that it is tolerable. However, make no mistakes, this is a one time only type of show for watching. I found it very hard to give this show even a 5 rating with all the misandrist commentary in the script. The more I move through the episodes, the more irritated I become with the writing and character interactions. The shame is that had the clear agenda been left out , this could have been a great piece of content for Netflix.",5
North America,"Ok, but nothing more. Flat.Main guy and his resemblance to Richard Madden is so obvious - and not just physical resemblance but also the role he played in Bodyguard - all is just a weak copy of the story... Only difference is the main female character - in Bodyguard she was strong and smart. This one is dull and pointless.At this point, it would be better to go through Wattpad than Netflix stories.Acting is bad, and chemistry is nonexistent.Characters are without depth and all is so predictable and expected that I had a feeling like I was rewatching and not watching for the first time.",6
North America,"Predictable plot-twists, generic telefilm villains, patriotic fuzzy feelings, a cast of helpless and dense female characters, a cast of monolithic and generic male ones. Everything is shiny, everyone is important and the clock is ticking all the time. Some characters are egregiously bad--SyFy kinda bad--and Sarah Desjardin is perhaps the worse of them all. Action scenes, car chases and fist fights are doubtlessly the most successful moments, so this is not the worse series out there, but this is not 'good' by any standard: I watched it to the end, but I usually checked my phone at least twice per episode, which is never a good sign (I only do so when I am bored).",4
North America,"Don't understand the great reviews, this was terribly bad, I managed to figure out who is the traitor right from the first episodes. No original story, terrible bad actions, silly dialogue that was very annoying, weak plot and way too many holes and mistakes in the story. And what's up with Rose acting so calm despite all the craziness, not to mention cracking the case in the second episodes ! Poor action and suspense, I was really bored, I barely managed to watch till episodes 3. Shocked to hear that this got renewed for a second season, while Netflix cancelling great shows like 1889 and archive 81 !! Seriously Netflix is losing their touch with great original content.",2
North America,"I have to come out and shout against this trend of shooting in low light to make the action utterly unviewable,and to put the sound effects and music over the dialog so it is almost unintelligible. This may be the modern ""artsy"" way of producing tv but frankly I have better things to entertain me than eye and ear strain. This may be a good drama but not for me and anyone over 50 who values sound and vision. Plenty of old movies and indeed current shows hold my interest without causing this stress.Have I added enough text yet as I have surely made my point? Appeal to real people not the critics.",3
North America,"I came here before watching and was almost put off it entirely by the bad reviews which included some of my pet peeves about a series. Anyhow, I was out of any good choices and this had moved up in the Top 10 on Netflix.I decided to give it a go, but went in with low expectations. None of the previously mentioned issues by other reviewers bothered me as the story was intriguing and fast paced. I loved shows like 24 back in the day and this had a similar feel.I guess it's not going to be everybody's cup of tea, but it's definitely worth a try if you're on the fence trying to decide. Have binged 9 of the episodes over the last day and a half. I can't remember there being a slow moment.",8
North America,"Pros:The actors are attractive and wholesome (except for the bad guys).It's perfect if you're tired of gritty TV series.Cons:Shallow and simplistic This is 8th grade level stuff.The protagonists use profanity in, I assume, a sad attempt to seem authentic.Technology right out of the 90'sLaughable spycraftAn FBI rookie who reports directly to the President's Chief-of-Staff. Really?The show makes me think that the screenwriter(s) could not be bothered to do any actual research on how the FBI works, how presidential administrations work, how hacking in general works (let alone the mechanics of a brute-force password attack). I am baffled by the popularity of this show.",5
North America,"With each episode, we were drawn in more and more. Our favorite genre is suspense, thriller or action and this series checked all the boxes and then some. There is unpredictable action and intrigue consistently in every episode. The cast is a perfect mix of seasoned actors, as well as a few that are brand new to us. The two main characters are our favorites and I think they work very well together. So well, that we plan to watch other shows they are in just so we can see more of them. We were so hooked that we couldn't wait to watch the next episode and ended up watching the entire season in one day. This has become the series I will be watching on a loop, until I know it by heart. ??. Can't wait for season two!",10
North America,"This show has a solid and intriguing storyline. However, it is weighed down by acting performances by the females which would embarrass community theatre actors.A young FBI agent who is saddled with a negative family history is assigned a desk job in the White House monitoring a phone that never rings. Soon, he receives a phone call which places him in the middle of a scandal with connections to the Oval Office. He teams up with an unlikely partner, and it's unclear who they can trust, and whether they can trust each other. As the story unfolds, we discover espionage, blackmail, murder, and treason.",7
North America,"The Night Agent"" is an incredibly engaging and thrilling TV series that will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The storyline is intricately woven and the pacing is perfectly executed, making for a truly binge-worthy experience. The show is filled with twists and turns that will leave you guessing until the very end.... Good story, engaging screen play and good action.. Very good series. Overall, ""The Night Agent"" is a must-watch for anyone who loves a good action thriller. The series is expertly crafted, with stunning visuals, a captivating storyline, and a talented cast that brings it all to life. If you haven't already seen it, I highly recommend giving it a watch!",10
North America,"Wow, this is the new ""hit""? If so, it makes me really sad. The story is extremely dumb and implausible and makes you laugh, the dialogue is stilted and cringy, the acting is mediocre, and that is putting it charitably. The leads have no charisma to speak of, especially the man who is supposed to be an FBI agent. I am amazed that this got made at all, and I really cannot believe that people are willing to watch it, and not only that, they are apparently enjoying it. Well, to each their own, but if this is supposed to be the new standard, I am truly dismayed. We are surely capable of producing infinitely better television than this sub-par nonsense.",3
North America,"I just finished watching the The Night Agent. And I must say I ReAlLy enjoyed watching this short series. I've been enjoying watching these short series, they don't drag out and there is usually bang bang bang action like this one. Action action action or something awesome awesome. This one is really worth watching it is full of action it really gets your emotions going on you before you know it you're shouting at the TV and you get really dry and then the acting is excellent, the actors didn't excellent job, The director did an excellent job as well as well as the production team. I was very impressed with how much went into this short series. And I would recommend watching this short series. Now if this is written right this could easily be made into a new series/movies that could become the new James Bond, Night Agent.",8
North America,I recently watched this series and can't get my head around how incredibly predictable the whole thing was.That being said I was able to watch the whole thing which makes it better than a lot of things I've tried to watch recently.It could of easily been a couple of hours shorter and still made the same impact.The acting was rather hit and miss. Or maybe I just didn't understand why everyone was always super serious. Yes I understand the tone of the series was a serious one but hardly anyone ever smiled. It had subplots that weren't fully explained and characters making decisions or choices that had no logic. Conversations seem to have been inserted to up the running time.I should add this isn't the usual sort of thing I watch so maybe other people will enjoy it more than me.,4
North America,"It had the same writing and acting style of a Power Rangers movie, it actually reminded me of that series when watching it. It was so ridiculous I can't believe it has good reviews. The bar has been raised with TV this century, some amazingly well written shows. I can't understand how this wasn't laughed at.I could go on and say the acting was shocking ( it was) but it wouldn't do justice for the writing . This makes Homeland look like Citizen Kane, yes even the last few series when it had almost become unwatchable.Netflix do some amazing documentaries but seem to cut corners with tv shows. I understand a second series has been commissioned, that'll be a mistake. Forget this and just watch Succession and if you've already seen that then watch it again. This will be a waste of your time unless you enjoyed Power Rangers, if you liked that you'll like this.",3
North America,"I can say that I generally liked the series. It was a quality action-police series and the acting was quite successful. However, the fact that it resembled the Jack Ryan series in some parts led me to some criticism.The plot had a structure that was difficult to understand at the beginning. Some knots should have been untangled beforehand to make it more fluent. The series did not have a good start, but the fluency began in the middle scenes and was particularly good in terms of unpredictability in the last episodes.I liked that the cybersecurity scenes maintained their consistency within their own structure, rather than having Hollywood fakeness. However, I cannot say the same about color dynamics. Dark scenes were not easily understood and this detracted from the series.In my opinion, the fluency of the action scenes could be increased a bit more. I noticed some careless scenes, which also bothered me.In conclusion, the series was successful for me, but it could have been better in some points. Congratulations to everyone who contributed.",8
North America,"Unlike many movies and shows I've watched recently, Night Agent was able to capture my attention and draw me in. I wouldn't blame everything I've been watching, it's more that I've been getting tired of over the top cliché and predictability.Does this show have that? Yes but in low doses more towards the middle/backend after you've been sucked in, The beginning episodes are fantastic, very well written 10/10.The middle and backend episodes are decent, definitely a drop in quality but they can keep you invested in the story - think subverted expectations but in a good way while eating a double cheeseburger with 6 extra slices of cheese.Final episode was definitely a step back towards amazing and is enough to have me invested in season 2.If you are unsure about watching this show just watch the first couple of episodes.",8
North America,"I am not a big fan of action shows - the fighting and stunts wear me out - but The Night Agent is a big exception. I love this show. The plot is easy to follow, not convoluted like many in the genre, yet suspenseful and in the end very satisfying. It has that rare feel-good quality, as you root for and are fully invested in the good guys - who are all, by the way, three dimensional. And the ensemble acting is flat-out terrific. My favorite performance is Luciane Buchanan's nuanced and down-to-earth characterization of Rose, and my God is she pleasing to look at! I eagerly await more seasons of The Night Agent. Netflix hits it out of the park with this one!",10
North America,"Aside from gabriel basso it's really bad acting especially luciana buchanan she's just terrible and while there is action but it's so predictible that it's boring, and the story itself we have to wait end ep 2 to have new info from what we knew beginning ep1 so not exactly fast paced show imo.There are also flashbacks if that's your thing ok, but every beginning of episode is a bit much
Could have been a great concept but it feels like they wanted it to cost so little that you can see and feel the cheap in every aspect of it whether it's the intrigue or the acting ,..., nothing feels like much thought has been put into it.",1
North America,"This series might be worth watching if nobody else has a TV series or film about a threat to the US President. Unfortunately, there is some superb entertainment in this genre and by comparison this fares poorly. The main characters (Peter and Rose) are played by likeable actors, as is the Vice President but the rest of the characters seem two dimensional, especially the White House Chief of Staff and the two main assassins. This is no ""Designated Survivor"" or ""House of Cards"".We did stick it out to see if it improved but ultimately felt that we had wasted our time and cannot recommend it. A pity as it has clearly been made with a high budget and attracted a top spot on Netflix.",3
North America,"Started watching this because Shawn Ryan has been involved with some of my favourite shows, and kept watching it in the hope that it would get better... but it got worse and I ended up watching it to the end just to see how bad it could possibly get.The first couple of episodes are disappointingly generic but you can kid yourself they're just laying down the basics so they can be twisted or subverted later. That Vice President who seems so devious and fascistic, obviously he's going to turn out to be a good guy... Nope. Those quirky assassins are going to turn out to be more than just cartoonish psychopaths with bad wigs... Nope. The good cop who shows a photo of his kid isn't going to get killed soon after... Nope. Every cliche is methodically checked off, every bit of sub-24 technobabble about comms and servers brought up, every firearm dependable and infinitely loaded until a fistfight would look better...The only cliche that didn't appear was the one where a bomb is defused with one second left on the timer. Every bomb that was set went off. So there was that.There were more holes in the plot than plot. Like how a convenient floor level hole that the VP's daughter kicked in the fake wall in the shipping container revealed a four character code that identified where she was. Surely it would be too dark to see even if the container was helpfully labelled on the inside six inches from the ground...And yet I watched the whole dumb thing. Why?",2
North America,"I had lots of hopes for this series. The first two episodes were very good. But, as with almost all American made spy series, it went to mush. I really think American writers/producers have no clue to what reality is. The acting is okay. Cinamatography is very good. But the script is horrible. After the first episode, it went down hill. As you watch, you litterally can see the flaws in that it would never happen in real life.Why is every kid in American cinima pissed off, self-centered, selfish, etc. Are there any good kids out there? Rose starts out good, but after the first episode, she's a btch, stupid, no common sense. After the second episode, she's an expert in the field. And Peter just gets dummer and dummer. And if that lady was so stinkin good at throwing a knife, why'd she miss?I'll finish it, but not worth it if you haven't started it. Just poor writing. If you like this kind of show, watch something from England, Sweden, S. Korea. America just puts in to much junk and stupidity.Thank you for your time.",5
North America,"This show has everything-it's the whole package! It kept me guessing and on my toes the whole time. When I thought I knew what was happening a twist would come and i was the definition of the Leo pointing at the tv meme. I just hate that I have to wait a while for season 2! I haven't been this entertained or Into a show in a while. I felt like it was well written with great characters. It didn't feel contrite or like It was trying too hard. It was a wild ride and I'm here for it! If you want something exciting with intrigue and not overkill on the gore and Sex, this is the show for you. Just be prepared for a lot of random f bombs!",10
North America,"Not every TV series has to be deep and/or re-invent the action/thriller genre. This is neither of those things, but the episodes fly by in a heartbeat with non-stop entertainment. The plot is one of those ""Some high-powered Americans in charge are up to no good and will do anything to do what they want and keep it all secret"" shows. It requires -- and has -- a person or in this case a pair who stumbles across a conspiracy. At the highest level. Who's involved? Who's not? It keeps you guessing while our intrepid duo earnestly figures it out. Along the way, we're introduced to a number of interesting characters, most any of whom could be up to no good.Kudos to the writers for creating a number of strong women who aren't stereotypes of anything really, but just people, some in positions of power, some not so much, who happen to be women. The exception to that is one main character who's pretty-much the stereotype of a deranged female assassin. But no writing's perfect.So put away your logic and disbelief and just enjoy this! It's a good one.",9
North America,"Very cheesy, lots doesn't make sense but it was somewhat entertaining! Not much more to watch I guess! Beats watching paint dry! Also they could have made an effort and hide the BC Lions logo in episode 7! Was not too hard to guess who the bad guys (or woman) are! Acting was ok, some lacked direction and over played it! I ended up watching it to see how it ends! But I still don't think it deserves a 1 on 10! I have to admit that the dangerous killers are a bit laughable but still was ok! Could have been 4 episodes with a better script or screenplay writer! Someone called it the American bodyguard... that is a bit far fetched! The bodyguard was way better!",6
North America,"There is almost nothing believable about this story. The notion that a White House Chief of Staff would be involved at all in an FBI operation started the downhill slide into what becomes a total farce. Nothing about the actions of the elected and appointed officials makes sense at all. And the civilians? Well, they should have stayed at home.In addition, there are countless subplots that further strain a viewer's willingness to continue watching. It's just too much for anyone to care about.Finally, the acting is for the most part an insult to the SAG. The VP role, in particular, is so badly acted that one has to wonder if anyone in the crew noticed this show was a waste of resources.Entertaining? Yes, to a degree. It's not a total waste of time but don't expect much.",2
North America,"Domestic intrigue. Good action scenes with very likeable lead characters. Nicely convoluted plot but not overly so. Good supporting characters. Altogether a fun series. If you like edge of the seat moments that are not too silly, this series is for you. One of the best of its genre. All the actors are believable. We are looking forward to a second season. I have to write and write and write. Otherwise they won't publish this review so I'll just reiterate, but you should stop reading about halfway through. Good lord, still not enough words. Very enjoyable and exciting series. Enjoy, enjoy enjoy.",10
North America,"As other reviewers mention, this is not a big budget production. All the lead characters are decent actors with the exception of the actress who plays Diane Farr. It's possible that Diane Farr's character was meant to be annoying ... if so, the director succeeded.The plot grabbed me right away. I wasn't sure who the good guys & bad guys were for several episodes ... and kept watching to find out. I appreciated the character development. It's important to me to be able to root for the heroes & boo the villains. I was also grateful that the shoot 'em up scenes were kept to a respectful minimum.The cinematography was good and the pace, for me, was just right. It's the perfect series to curl up on the couch with the remote during a weekend where the outside weather is dismal.",8
North America,"This was a good show, never read the novel but I always liked spy thrillers and any good shows related to law enforcement, counterterrorism, military, etc, and this is an exciting show but it's predictable and not very memorable. I think all fans of the genre will enjoy this show but not something we'd watch through multiple times. Get me binging though! The main character being a low level FBI agent who somehow gets thrown under the bus is odd, especially when he seems to be extremely talented and overqualified for being a low level agent, kind of like a Jack Ryan style G Man thriller but the action was awesome and the acting was good I think.",8
North America,I would like to tell anyone reading this review that this is an unexpected gem and honestly a really quick binge watch. Excellent quality of story and filmography. Solid story with a real world feel to it and unexpectedly compelling storytelling not in any way the normal streaming fare. I watched ten episodes in two days and wish for a second continuation. The two leads are unknown to me but I imagine we'll see them again. Really even then agnostics are well acted and they are many. The various depictions of the president and the vice president are well cast as well as the daughter of the vice president and various people portrayed as white house support staff. Without spoilers just go watch. Really really good stuff.,9
North America,"This could have been so much better if the writing and the scenario were being carefully though over. The acting is also bad and the chemistry of the leading pair, not existing. The reaction of the leading girl when her aunt and uncle dies, is just stupid. She does not ask to see them or even appear remotely distressed. Or later when one of their friends die, again they seem unhappy about it but that's as far as it goes. Just rlly poor writing and dialogues. Watch the bodyguard or even the other one with the lawyer , name I can't remember, which are bot much better. Anyway, if you have nothing better to do, ok watch it. Otherwise don't bother. I'm rlly surprised by the other reviews. I mean even the motive behind all this. Ok I don't like this terrorist guy, so I'm gonna hide his murder by killing 3 blocks of innocent people. And this from the almost highest ranking in the government. Not good.",5
North America,"We really wanted this to be a decent series since it's been pretty slim pickings for a while...but this is just meh. It actually feels like maybe the whole thing was written by AI. The plot seems to have a high school level of law enforcement understanding and the script just had no substance. People don't talk like this. They don't interact like this. And everything about the DD of the FBI was nonsensical. There's so many brilliant books out there that would make amazing series if done right, how do they come up with this flimsy cheap content that requires you to switch off your logical mind.",6
North America,"Netflix, in its earlier days used to make good movies and drama series. House of Cards is a good example. It also licensed excellent tv series like Revenge so that we could watch them without commercials. That was the biggest value proposition for me. Now, Netflix is trying to create originals, most of them are pretty bad full of explicit sex, drugs, and f words. The Night Agent is an exception, excellent story, well produced and directed. Many of the originals have actors who do not belong in the script but are there to satisfy diversity. Korean, Northern European, some other foreign shows are an exception.",8
North America,"The Night Agent is Superb! My husband and I watch it every chance we get! I do so want to slap some of those people into next week! That Maddie Redfield! Uugghh!The actors that play Agent Sutherland and Rose Larkin really did a great job! You could believer this is really happening to them!The killers, the chases, the teamwork; it all pulls together to create a show we just love watching!I'm really looking forward to finding out what the Enemy wants and what can be done to prevent it.I'm really glad they found the baby that had been stolen! What a blessed thing!Can't wait to see what happens next!",10
North America,"I'll be honest and give it to you straight - whether you will find it half decent or not depends upon what exactly are you looking for to watch - something that should be enough to keep you engaged to kill your boredom, or something that needs to be very logical and up-to-the-mark so that it leaves you dazzled?As for the first option, it's a green. Watch it, you'll enjoy it. The leads did okay, the storyline is okay (it's not GREAT but it does manage to change the character you suspect quite a few times), and you'll even find the ending decent.However, if you're more on the side of the second option, I'm afraid you may find various faulty logic-induced situations that might annoy your analytical mind. Therefore, you might not enjoy it that much.Nonetheless, some episodes are better than the others, and overall, it's still quite a thrill-watch to sit back and enjoy.Happy watching! :)",7
North America,"Your usual FBI show.Some TERRIBLE acting, laughably so... along the lines of SyFy quality of acting. There plenty of enjoyable action & quite predictable twists. This is an ideal show for some passive viewing, when you're mindlessly scrolling social media, cooking, cleaning or doing anything else. It does not require your full attention. In fact, right now I am writing this review while also ""watching episode"" :)These types of shows have their place. It will not change your life and you will not be dying for another season, but you will have a clean house, some cooked food, maybe even a sourdough loaf AND be up to date on your social media feed!",5
North America,"This can be done right, like State of play, Bodyguard or Slow horses, but Night Agent is far far from that.The writing is cringeworthy and the acting is flat. The observant viewer will figure out who the traitor is in the first two episodes and that leaves you with 9 long episodes to suffer through. A major government conspiracy is discovered through a Google image search. That's how intricate the plot is. The two protagonists are about as interesting as a pair of cardboard cutouts whereas the main villains are oddly unhinged.The only reason I finished the show is because I was home sick and didn't have the bandwidth for something more complicated. But if you're not knocked out by the flu, don't bother with this embarrassment.",1
North America,"Terrible language. Bad writing. But why is everyone saying it's so awesome? I must be missing something. It just seems lazy and unnecessary to have all the dialogue loaded with swearing - sometimes when it doesn't even fit.Pros: Good chemistry with leads. The lead guy is super handsome and it made me look up his profile to see what else he had been in. Decent storyline.Fast moving and a good pace with the storytelling.Good creepy vibe with the couple that is stalking the girl - they are pretty good at acting the part of bad guys.Overall good but even if I could watch on Vidangel They would have to bleep out every other word!! Look all I'm saying is if Bourne identity can pull it off, the night agent should be able to as well.",3
North America,"I enjoyed this at first, but it couldn't sustain so many episodes. It should have been a single film or much shorter series - 5 episodes maximum. I liked the two lead actors and look forward to seeing them in better productions. Here their roles were a bit superficial. More back story and some hanky-panky would have been beneficial. The bad guys were pathetic, as was their plot. I'm still not sure what they were up to. There was not a single scene with Hang Chau that I bought into her character. Just looked like somebody that strolled onto the set wearing a weird wig. Too bad, because I like women in strong roles -such as Chief of Staff for the President. Opportunity lost.",6

North America,"I'm not sure what everyone expected with this show, it was super enjoyable. Fleshed out villains who could blur the line, solid actors, characters you could root for.The action begins 1/4 through the first episode and doesn't conclude until 3/4 into the last episode. Once it starts going it does not let up.The series held my attention through out, and it was a fun, entertaining ride. I was surprised how much I enjoyed this series as I tend to enjoy more cerebral series'.This won't be for everyone but if you are seeking an action packed conspiracy thriller that leaves no stone unturned and thoroughly entertains, then look no further.Highly recommend!",9
North America,"It's been a while since I've seen a show that had me watching several episodes one after the other. This is an entertaining adventure that features an FBI agent who ends up working together with someone who has been targeted by unknown bad guys. Each episode they work together to investigate the mystery surrounding the events of the first episode.It might seem like there are some coincidences or character introductions that don't have anything to do with the main plot at various parts, but it all comes together in the end. It has a diverse cast but it's not woke trash like so many of the other shows that are on Netflix. It's just entertainment without an agenda.",8
North America,"As someone who served as an Army Officer and now works in the intelligence community, I finished the last episode, and my only thought was ""I really enjoyed that."" No, it's not the most groundbreaking political thriller, but it's complex enough to keep you guessing, the characters are engaging, the story is fast paced, and there's very little wasted time (everything has a purpose). When I had the time, I always looked forward to the next episode, and I was never disappointed.One of the subtle elements that I perhaps enjoyed the most is there's really no ""damsel in distress"". All of the characters have their own unique attributes, and all of them can pull their weight based on their specific roles. As a consequence, you get attached to all of the main characters in different ways, and it draws you in to the deeper story.",9
North America,"FBI agent who uncovers a devious plot within the White House and has to race against time to save the world. Of course there's a girl helping him, whom he rescued from assassins. Subplots include a mystery about our hero's father, problems with the VP's daughter and some secret service agents who are on the side of right.It is all incredibly formulaic and predictable, but the script isn't too bad and there's plenty of action for those who like that. The main problem is that the lead actor, Gabriel Basso, puts in a subpar performance, quite wooden and unconvincing. Most of the rest do a serviceable job.Ultimately it's 10 episodes of reasonable entertainment which doesn't require a single morsel of cerebral effort from the viewer, and you know exactly how things will turn out. This genre has been done much better in other series, but then again also much worse. 6/10.",6
North America,"So as the episode begins in the first 5 min you'll feel like they are trying to create a character with all the goodies I mean an agent with troublesome past but still happy which in real life is not the truth and agents mostly have a stressful life in reality. Again an agent which is still young but has kind of no weak spots, so it might seem like they are just throwing some action adventure mix story just to get it entertaining.You might want to close it eventually but if hold on to then it gets a little slow paced and at some point interesting and then you'll want to carry on. Some of the story part you'll find logical but others not.The show is not the worst but if you are hoping that it ticks all ingredients of a good NETFLIX spy story, it doesn't.Still it's good to watch if you have nothing else better than this, it won't get you bored at all.",6
North America,"I don't know who came up with this darkness effect on movies and TV shows. But even when it's dark in the daytime, it's hard to make out what's going on sometimes and the night scenes are even worse. This is just too darn dark, dark dark. I think it distracts from the action question I don't know who you contact or complain to about this production design. I would think the actors themselves wouldn't be happy with this kind of technique. I think it takes away from their ability to do their jobs. Come to the point that if it's a new thing and it's dark in the first episode, I will not watch the rest.",6
North America,"Ok the action is good and the script is good, it is a little stretched out 10 episodes is too much but it's watchable but..
Is that a way a lead actor is holding a gun? I mean where's the training? It's too obvious how he waves it around like what's wrong with directing these days?To the actess who plays rose, this is not acting this is pure annoyance actually, and did anyone count how many times she says ""My aunt and uncle"" ,. And what's with the serious face all 10 episodes if she didn't even cry one tear for her "" aunt and uncle""I'm worried about movies for this generation, we'll miss the great actors alot!",4
North America,"I can't remember who in the film industry once described a successful project, small or large screen, as one that causes the viewer to care about the characters in it. Of the millions of such statements I've heard this is the one that has proved to be most, and most often, true.I realize that fact once I've finished watching something I really liked and did happen to care about the characters.The Night Agent, is one of those.The premise is an effective hook. The action is consistent and almost immediate with few slow spots. Some characters are not who they seem which makes for some healthy ambiguity that keeps you guessing.The Night Agent is for those of us who love conspiracy/action flix involving underdogs who are expected to accomplish overwhelming tasks against bigger, badder, diabolical foes.It wasn't perfect. It's the first season. It's surely gonna have another and that's a good thing. A good thing because we'll get to see the newest Night Agent come into his own. And being the insomniac that I am, I'll probably watch the next season without a break like I did the first.Look forward to season 2...",9
North America,"So i just completed series 1 of the night agent. From the first episode i was hooked and wanted to know what happens next. Another way i measure whether i am being entertained or not is if i look at my phone when im watching something. For every episode on the night agent my phone was never taken out of my pocket.Excellent acting- excellent action!! I would not take notice of the other reviews stating about logic or real life spy stuff.. calm down mateys its fiction... Jeeeez!! Anyway as i was saying, there are likeable characters in this series (except agent arrington, she was annoying andddd everyone else played their roles to perfection.Trust me just watch it... you wont be disappointed!!",9
North America,"The first two episodes are what really make or break a TV show. As of the first episode, I can't really say I enjoy this show at all. I mean, any sort of show that involves government espionage and double agents really seem predictable or can't be executed just right. And this is no exception. This show throws logic and character development out the window.The problem I have is that these characters don't feel all that interesting. One agent is put on night duty answering calls that rarely occur because of an incident that wasn't his fault, and he has to protect this lady who apparently knows something that would get her killed by federal agents. This doesn't make things any bit better because the main assassins are a couple, and boy are they absolutely cringy to watch sometimes. I don't give a damn about some awkward romantic evening and also being on call to some corrupt agent giving them assignments.Worst of all, the acting was above average at best. I'm not acting expert but every delivery felt kinda dry. I'm not the one to say how to portray an FBI agent any better than what the actors could do but there's certainly a ton of room for improvement to make agents not feel static like they're directly reading off a teleprompter. Again, the antagonists as well; really weirdly played out. A couple being trained assassins just doesn't fit for being a serious show.As I said before, this felt predictable. It's like I've heard of this espionage plot before. Because of this, it just made this show meh. Good disposable entertainment from your dear friend, Netflix. Watch if you want but don't think that this is a ""must watch"" show anytime soon.",3
North America,"Yeah, I did want to like it... And I actually did, for an episode or so.The storyline isn't totally unique, but its fresh enough, and there's a slight new angle. The sets are great, the location shots are cool... The action - yeah!It's the acting, and the writing, and the bad acting trying to deliver the bad writing while trying hard not to fall into a plot hole... (hah! I couldn't resist)I think it's easy to get wrapped up in the action, Its good, and there's a good amount of it. But, when you're wondering about the bad guys smoking out the cabin, you don't realize how totally nuts it is to have the good guys 30' down the road when the bad guys exit.The show tries to leave you in that state of ""well, maybe the postman did it with the fire ax!"" but you instead realize that you're supposed to be feeling that way, than actually feeling that way.Casting... Yeah, nah. I think a bad cast has a chance with a good script, but a bad script just keeps a bad cast in 4-point movies.",4
North America,"It's incredible how many 10 reviews are here.After watching I'm wondering if they are actual reviewers (if they are the future is dark).There's absolutely no logic, you can find very big mistakes every few minutes in every episode.The mistakes are not only on logic and continuity but also makes no sense in comparison with real life situations, protocols and decisions (that even the dumbest person would take).I've read other reviews like the one you are reading now, and thought it can't be that bad, well it is that bad.Oh. I almost forgot acting is quite bad also, not credible but that is not the worst. The worst is the bad script, the lack of sense of the plot and the incredible numbers of unreal situations.You can ve doing something better than this show for sure.",1
North America,"This show manages to be really entertaining well having a jumbled mess of a plot. I really like the concept, but the execution is crummy. The worst part of the show though is just how predictable it is. Everytime a new character was introduced you could just immediately tell if they were good or not. I'm not even joking everything feels as predictable as a children's book. The show goes back and forth between deciding the real reason they would be gong after her along with a bunch of other things. Also this is a pretty minor detail, but you're telling me these people are highly trained, but the fight like if you grabbed a crowd of people out of a coffee shop.",5
North America,"Young FBI Agent Peter Sutherland was the right man in the wrong place when he managed to prevent a terrorist atrocity on the Washington DC Metro. A year later he is approached about a new position; he is to sit in a room in the White House monitoring a phone that 'never rings'. Rose Larkin is a young cybersecurity entrepreneur who is staying with her aunt and uncle. She hears them talking about somebody who can't be trusted in the White House. Shortly afterwards two assassins attack the house; Rose's aunt and uncle instruct her to flee to the neighbours and call a phone number. She does; it is Peter's phone. The two of them are about to be catapulted a deadly conspiracy that will see them forced to go on the run as it becomes clear that there are few people they can trust. Elsewhere somebody appears to be plotting something involving the Vice President's daughter.I thought this was a solid thriller with a good premise. The opening scenes are explosively exciting and the action rarely lets up for the rest of the series. Peter and Rose are fine protagonists and the supporting characters are good too; notable amongst these are the two assassins who are after them, the VP's daughter and the two Secret Service Agents protecting her and the White House chief of staff who is the only person in authority Peter trusts. There are plenty of twists and turns throughout the series keeping us wondering just who can be trusted. It does require some suspension of disbelief, as do most series in this genre. The cast does a good job. Too many series leave without wrapping up enough plot lines in the hope of getting a second season; thankfully this nicely resolves all the key issues but still manages to end in a way that leaves the possibility open for more. Overall I'd recommend this to fans of the genre.",8
North America,"The trailer let me know that this wasn't going to be up to standard but I gave it two episodes only because I saw Adam Arkin's name on list of directors. He doesn't choose projects lightly. The pilot showed some promise but in the end it's a weak, American TV script. Just not up to snuff for prestige streaming TV, in my opinion. And I know this dude can write from The Shield which, in it's prime, was excellent. Although come to think of it, that story became more and more ridiculous as time went on. This is over-the-top implausible the way ""24"" was. If I can't suspend disbelief why am I watching?! Yes, espionage thrillers are very difficult to pull off but streaming services, in general, get the very best from around the globe. Fauda, Kleo, Bodyguard...it's in the writing! This was phoned in and looks like it was put together during the pandemic with no money. I bailed after the 2nd ep. I couldn't even wait around to see if Adam A could turn out a decent episode.",4
North America,I managed to only sit through the first thirty minutes as the script was so bad and the actors didn't really get a chance to grab my attention.The typical American drama/spy series with all the 'pretty people' also makes truly unbelievable.Was really looking forward to a good new series to watch and was totally disappointed.This story seems to get re-made every couple of years.Would be good if they could come up with something new or original for a change.I've been watching so many great British Television shows recently that any of the American ones just don't seem to be able to come up to the same standards.,2
North America,"Excuse the non English speaker...
I never wrote a review before, but this show puzzled me enough to share my opinion about it.The story itself seems very interesting and captivating , but the execution is really bad. There are gaps in writing, there are completely illogical situations, the conversation is cliché on cliché, the music is...B production material... the acting... oh my. There are some decent performances (the villains mostly), but the main characters, especially the computer programmer Rose is to be laughed at sometimes.Despite all the above, to my own surprise, I binged it. The main character Peter Sutherland was mostly convincing, the two mercenaries had interesting personal story going on, and there were few other entertaining moments that kept me wanting more. I read that second season is planned... hopefully with budget better used and more convincing acting.",6
North America,"Like some other people it seems I also watched this show on a whim, knowing nothing about it and expecting a fairly standard political thriller.Well it was standard in some ways, but it had a fresh and unique style I thought, very gritty and convincing fights and a great chemistry in the duo of the main characters who both showed a lot of energy. I liked the quirky oddball assassins too.I noted that Luciane's plucky female lead ""Rose"" adjusted rather too easily to the dilemma she was thrown into, but I found myself hugely entertained by the gutsy way she was always jumping right in to help in the fights. Gabriel Basso was wholly likeable and despite the occasional inconsistency in the cast there were moments of truly skilful acting all around, and snappy dialogue.Again, there was something about this show that was really easy to enjoy - I suppose it's not great art but it sure was a fun watch, and I'm already looking forward to season two.",9
North America,"I didn't have high expectations, and that helped me enjoy this easily watchable series. From my point of view, it's a well executed action/thriller series, with nostalgic characteristics.With a few exceptions, there is a lot of decent acting and fairly executed scenes. It managed to keep me interested, even though there were some predictable parts of the storyline. That's totally ok, as long as the writers are not pretending otherwise.I'm happy that Netflix has finally put out something that is simple, yet enjoyable. Would willingly watch another season, and hopefully the style and identity of the series remains the same.",7
North America,Peter Sutherland..first thing that comes to mind is 24 Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland). Love watching spy and espionage type shows this one is for you. I was hoping it would be similar to 24 with more seasons and episodes we'll see if that happens as I am finishing up episode 10. Peter and Rose played there roles well. Show has a lot of action and and a solid story line. Excited to see what's to come and hope it gets renewed for season 2. I haven't checked yet.Everyone have a nice day and be kind to one another. Thanks for reading my review! God Bless America! We are all one human race love you all.,10
North America,"This is a really good show. The acting is great and the storyline is superb. The characters in this show are multi faceted, even the supporting actors that play the assassins - I really felt for them when watching the parts that the woman assassin wanted to get away from her job and have a family like other normal. I'm really pleasantly surprised to see that aspect of the show, because usually the bad characters are just one dimensional. The relationship between the two leads is really natural too, nothing feels forced. Love the portrayal of Diane Farr the chief of staff character. She's also pretty impressive. All in all a really great show. Super excited for season 2!!",10
North America,"This will be very straight to the point. The lead female protagonist is played by a very wooden actress. The lead male protagonist isn't exactly the most exciting actor either but he shines by comparison.Robert Patrick and Hong Chau give weight to an otherwise unsteady cast.Each episode's screenplay, such as they are, aren't probably treated by the director to make the dialogue at least try to work in a number of moments. Nonetheless these are issues that could also have been fixed in the editing room. The mistakes are as baffling as scenes where the dialogue is clearly written for the action to be fast, but what transpires on screen before us is mind numbingly slow - or vice versa.So to are there a lot of odd jumps that are either shoddy writing, shoddy editing, or shoddy direction.Is this show watchable? Sure. But only an idiot doesn't know what happens next.",4
North America,"Honestly at first I wasn't expecting anything, but surprisingly this series blows my mind. Strong element of this series is the Plot... so good...!!I even has to stopped for a while to catch my breath overwhelmed by how this series present the surprises.Although the casts play the role felt a bit flat but I like the interactions between Ellen and Dale, the dialogue, the depth and how Phoenix Raei plays Dale, nice...!!Nothing much about the details of technical aspects, but again I have to say that the story is so good..!!Can't wait for season 2. Hopefully the writers could keep up the good work.",8
North America,"A well written spy thriller that is fast yet even-paced all the way through. There were no 'off' episodes, there wasn't anything TOO unrealistic or hokey about it, no ""that doesn't make any sense"" or ""nobody would ever do that in real life"" moments, which is seemingly very tough to do these days since nearly every show has several of them.It's not Oscar-worthy or anything that's going to be talked about a lot years from now, but this is just an an all-around solid watch that is very fun and binge-able. Settle in over the weekend and have a good time with The Night Agent and I'll look forward to season 2.",8
North America,"This is a bad knock off of a stupid show, The Bodyguard. It is entirely stupid on it's own, but looking at it as a knock off of an entirely stupid show, it's on a whole level of new stupid. At no point does the plot work, it makes no attempt at logic, and the characters have no depth. Objectively and subjectively this is bad.Their concept of how the branches of government work, or even vague ideas of feasible conspiracy theories are pathetic.All that being said, weed is mostly legal now, and you might as well use that, and go for a binge on this show. It's still lots of ""stuff"" going on ????? with attractive people ??",5
North America,"I had feared that this series would not be much good, and so I was confirmed. The story is a rehash of parts that have been seen many times, nothing is surprising, there are no twists, there are no credible characters or plot elements, everything is in the realm of hysterical conspiracy theories that are not fundamentally revealed. The viewer is not left in the dark about the characters themselves, but rather about their motives. But that doesn't matter in the end, as one is more concerned with the acting inadequacies of Gabriel Basso as agent Peter Sutherland or the atrocious Hong Chau as the shady Diane Farr. Fola Evans-Akingbola fits seamlessly into these poor performances. It is to be feared that there will be a 2nd season, which I will definitely not watch, because it can only get worse.",4
North America,"You know just a reminder that this is a Netflix show and lately (most of) their shows suck and since Designated Survivor season 1 and Black List (was it Netflix from the start though?) there hasn't been a action thriller released that met this standard for me.Now the thing is wether or not they'll continue the plot with the current characters (who I really enjoyed, really loved the leads) or do a new story line with a new night agent (which could be promising if the writing isn't lazy or repetitive - it could turn itself into the blacklist franchise)However I really hope they don't go around the mess up the second season by not being creative enough.",9
North America,"I was hooked early in the first episode, and had to binge it because I couldn't wait to get to the next episode. Gabriel Basso and Luciane Buchanan were exceptional in the lead roles, and the chemistry that they came to have during an almost impossible situation just made everything so real and believable. The supporting cast was pretty amazing too. Whoever did the casting here, really nailed it. Nice job! Sometimes I start to wonder when watching a movie or series, 'Do I really care what happens to these people?' Here, the answer is a definite 'Yes!'. I must say, this is one of the best series I have seen in a long while!",10
North America,"I'm a huge fan of political thrillers like this, that remind me of the Jason Bourne series and Bodyguard starring Richard Madden, so when I saw the preview for this a few months ago I was excited to see it! At the same time, I knew it was going to be a Netflix show (which many times can be a hit or miss) so I wasn't expecting a perfect show.When I started the show less than a week ago, I admit that the first episode didn't quite impress me (the actress who played Rose was a little flat in her acting during the inciting incidents-she did get much better throughout though!) but as each episode progressed, things got a lot more captivating, interesting, mind-blowing, and entertaining!I won't give anything away, but the strength of this show is the plot! Talk about plenty of plot twists and political intrigue! The actors were all pretty good, and as others have said, the story just makes sense. Nothing too far-fetched or unbelievable. The only reason I give this 1 less star than perfect is because of the weaker start, but it certainly redeems itself very quickly. Don't write off the show based in the 1st couple of episodes. Stick it out, and I promise you, you will enjoy it. The actress that portrayed Diane Farr was my absolute favorite, and the writers just did an overall good job of giving all the major characters back stories and dimension without making it lengthy.Everything is also pretty simple to follow along with even if you're not familiar with this genre of film or American politics. Watched 2 episodes a night and finished in less than a weeks. This truly is a must watch this spring. Give it a chance.",9
North America,"As per the the title.I'm not sure if she's supposed to be a complete moron or mentally handicapped, but if so, than she is absolutely nailing it without question.If on the other hand, she is supposed to be a fully functioning adult who's living in a facsimile of the real world, she is failing in every possible way.Psycho killers chasing her, she's worried about jumping down from a height of maybe 8 to 10 feet. Delays doing so by asking relevant but not truly necessary questions (in the sense that she doesn't have time to question things).There are a dozen instances where she just asks the most vapid questions imaginable, as if she's never once in her life seen a single spy movie or anything dealing with covert government ops.It's true that when you work for such an organization, doing shady things, you would or should naturally be suspicious of anybody and everybody, but she flip flops between being super suspicious, to not, and at the same time making the guy question his superiors motives.The psycho killer female is also a moron, she seems to want to set down roots and play house with her killing partner who may or may not have a functioning penis. Unless they are actually living in the area and renting, I see no rationale where this makes sense. I got the impression that they were mobile assassins, and would relocate as per each contract requires.Alternatively maybe she's wanting them both to settle down and slow down on their killings and live a more sedentary lifestyle???This is a review of only the first 3 or 4 episodes, will update after I watch more.",3
North America,"This one fits in nicely with 90% of TV drama. It fills in the gaps between the occasional good stuff and serves as padding for Netflix.That is it's purpose and as such, is banged out factory-like along with dozens of others low brow shows. There's very little money thrown at it. Mostly 2D characters forcing along the disjointed plot, acting by numbers and jobbing actors who don't really care what they're told to say. Ok for some background noise while you're doing something more interesting. There's really not much more today other than I have another forty characters to finish this revie...",5
North America,"I know the show is fantasy as is all TV so I try not to be too hard and expecting realism, but this show is just too ridiculous with various plot holes.The ability of high-level government officials to meet clandestinely, absolutely ridiculous. I forget what episode but multiple shots fired at a hotel and no police on scene. Absolutely ridiculous. The multiple times when experienced law-enforcement personnel didn't immediately call for back up, absolutely ridiculous.And experience law enforcement officer, taking direction from a civilian and a civilian knowing better than the law enforcement officer completely ridiculous.Why the heck they didn't get online and get the story out to everyone they could once they realized the Chief of Staff was in on it defies all logic. Get the heat on them, get the story out.The way the VP talks to the chief of staff about his next move when his daughter is kidnapped and he suspects she is involved, colossally ridiculous. They threaten him and he does nothing? I could go on and on about this stupid show.If you want, mindless, fantasy and adventure, go ahead enjoy. You've got to be able to really put your brain on hold though. It might be easier to do that if the show came across as more of a comedy rather than a serious drama. Very soap opera-ish even at times.",2
North America,"You got all these self proclaimed ""thinkers"" assuming that others don't recognize or acknowledge inconsistencies in shows when in reality they aren't letting it warp their whole view of what is a more than decent plot. If you aren't the annoying kind, you'll probably really enjoy this show and finish it quickly. It has nice suspense. I think the initial action kick off seemed out of nowhere and even after it had been going on for 5 minutes I still wasn't really feeling anything, but the explanations and the progression that follows makes up for it. The characters aren't super well developed but for this kind of show, we really don't need a lot of back story, if anything when they delve into the past it's when I get kind of bored. Just be wary they drag their feet a little coming to the conclusions and the amount of side quests they experience will also get old when you're anxious for the unveiling..",7
North America,"This show is an example of good story telling, to some extend it takes too much time on unnecessary details. But it tries to develop characters and provide some background motivation for their actions. Overall, for there are too many fillers that stretch the story a little too much. Also, there are too many unbelievable moments in there. It is just entertainment, but the only believable part in there is, that part of the US goverment would be willing to accept severe collateral damage among their own citizen to protect their own interests and stay in power. That's some truth in there. Besides that, there are far too many moments that leaves you dumbfolded. Nevertheless, the story unfolding is capturing, even though to some point you just want to see if you predicted it right.",6
North America,"...and padded with too many dull and basically meaningless scenes. The plot is quite a bit past believable and wildly over complicated. The cast in so-so, no standout actors. Like so many Netflix series it is at least three episodes longer than it needed to be. I'm a bit surprised to see the high ratings. It's just not that good That's all
I really have to say but IMDB-like Netflix-requires that reviews be longer than they need to be so I've got to pad it with stuff like this. The bottom line is that this is a decent series if you have a lot of extra time on your hands but there are many more worthwhile shows.",4
North America,"I just finished season 1 of The Night Shift and while I enjoyed the majority of the series, it does have some issues that don't seem likely to change. Let's start with the good: Great action, intriguing storyline and great acting by the lead role, someone I've never seen before and expect to see more of. It's a pretty dark show, there are some gruesome deaths that are both shocking and entertaining for the premise of the show. The bad: some dialogue is laughably horrible, the mistakes are repetitive and the bad guys are obvious. I knew who was behind everything halfway thru episode 2. If you can suspend your logic, you might enjoy it.",7
North America,"There's no way a human could have written this stiff, awkward dialog that sounds as though it was either translated from a foreign language into English or simply put through an AI program. Human people (as distinguished from AI people) simply don't talk the way these poor actors are forced to talk -- in simple sentences that betray almost no real emotion, sentences that sound like a computer's idea of how humans might talk: ""We must go now because there is danger ahead."" ""You had better watch out now please."" ""Be careful as someone might be about to kill you."" (Not actual sentences from the show; these are much more human-sounding.)The shame here is that clearly everyone is trying hard. And the plot is no better nor worse than other successful shows. But the dialog is so laughably bad that even the AI program that created this is probably too embarrassed to take credit for it.",2
North America,"Netflix again throws at us some sub rate rubbish serie.It took us 20 minutes of the first episode to turn it off and remove from the watch list.During those 20 minutes we burst few times laughing, mind this is not a comedy, so this tells.After the main female character reaction to the news about the death of her aunt and uncle ""but people loved them so much"" (argh!!!!!! Who wrote this idiotic line????) we had it.I wish Netflix stopped wasting monies on producing such rubbish - if they keep offering telenovela level junk, maybe they should also think about cutting their prices because bumping into such series makes me willing to rethink the rationale behind paying the premium subscription rate.Of course there is still plenty to watch, but I can't believe the audience of Netflix has such poor taste or is so little demanding that this production pops as the top 10.It becomes also tiring to spend time looking for something decent to watch, just because the ratio of poor production keep increasing by Netflix.It comes to that I am specifically while browsing looking for movies/series without the Netflix logo.It is kinda sad, there was time when I would not pay attention to that.Life is too short, don't waste your time on that one.",2
North America,Have you watched Batman v. Superman.Well it sucked cause the story was there and it wasn't told and this has some good action but the story telling tracks about as good as my 9 year old nephew telling me a story.This is a cute show but that's about it. I now understand why there are so many in the way people. How tf is this a 7.4. Get lost.I have to continue this review cause it's too short. So let's speak as if we are writers of said show. Guy on bus boom. Cute omg nice guy what. Action. Get chased. Love interest. More booms. Someone isn't trusted. Oops bad acting. Talk about secrets cause that's cool. Sass from the villains. More bad acting. Don't keep a story line. Have more sass. Sell to stupid people on Netflix. $$$,3
North America,"This is one of the worst written shows I've seen. It starts well but just gets worse with every episode. Do NOT get invested in this by starting a single episode.The plot holes are so obvious and so many. It's nonsensical. It seems as if the writers/producers knew how bad the writing and plot were but just didn't care. Why does an FBI agent need the help of a journalist to analyse the value of evidence? Why can't a ""former navy SEAL"" swim a single decent lap? How do the VP and Chief of staff with the highest security clearance not have a secret service detail at all times?The lead duo are horrible actors with no chemistry whatsoever. The two assassins were better actors, with a better storyline and more chemistry than the leads.How does Netflix produce this garbage!",3
North America,"The mystery, character interactions, fast-paced sequences and on-the-spot conclusions drawn by our heroes are all excellent. Pursuers, menacing and dangerous. Relationship between the two leads are enjoyable and feels organic. Character backgrounds quickly established but not left wanting. You know exactly who these people are and everything they do lines up with what is told. All-in-all very well done.However, critical parts of it are completely unrealistic. Setting aside how top-level govt access works for which knowledge I have none, obvious common sense occurrences are absolutely ridiculous. There'll be covert planning done within clear earshot of someone that my be compromised sitting less than five feet away. You don't need experience with agency procedure to see how nonsensical this is. How can anyone continue to believe the plot with such an egregious oversight? It outright removes any danger or tension felt since this takes you out of it entirely. Also, other common sense things like needing to provide personal information for access to public records is just not even thought of by someone who is supposed to be brilliant at most everything else up to this point. Anyone and their mother would consider this before walking into the building, especially with a fugitive status. It's like they created this situation just to show how smart this character is by them improvising a solution, but they're not smart enough to have realized the obstacle in the first place? Things like this happen throughout the season with varying degree, but now and then you'll come across something that is so in your face it feels lazy, and completely undermines the high points this show has to offer. That's a shame, since there's a lot going for it.I gave it a seven because it's still fun to watch. Despite the above and some awkward over-acting by some of the cast it held my attention and made me want to see what happens next. Right on the edge of being a fantastic show but ends up just shy of that.Entertaining, long as you don't think too hard about it.",7
North America,"You start with a premise that is entirely unbelievable... a young woman awakens in the night to be told she needs to escape and contact the FBI (why can't they all escape?). She's told nothing of importance and given nothing of significance... and yet the bad guys pursue her like she's holding the holy grail. And the FBI will spare nothing to protect her... or kill her. Literally nothing about this makes sense.And then the female lead becomes the most annoying and snarky character in the show... literally never sheds a single tear after the only family she has left is murdered... And the male lead seems entirely incompetent and overly emotional in a way that makes it difficult to root for him. The entire plot is wrapped in in such a duplicitous, cockamamie, twisty turny shifting plot that eventually you don't really care who the bad guy is anymore and what they want... bc none of it makes sense. Literally not a single character in this show makes a move that makes any sense. They make moves that only serve to further the plot, logic be damned. The best thing I can say about this show is that I made it 7 episodes, so it's tolerable for a while...The writing: awful 4/10
The acting: wooden 6/10
The characters: hateable 4/10
The direction: boring 5/10
The story: generic 5/10
The action: incredibly poorly choreographed 5/10
The romance: forced 0/10I gave this 5/10 OVR bc if you can convince yourself to watch this show, it's probably bingeable, however at best you'll forget about this show as soon as you finish watching it. At worst you'll question every decision that led you into wasting the time it took to finish the entire season. I hope this doesn't get picked up for another season.",5
North America,"I'm not sure why there are so many bad reviews, but I loved this series and I hope that there is a season two. After having watched the series I decided to go back and read the book on which it was based. Very loosely based I might add. Now after finishing the book I can honestly say (in my opinion) that this is one instance where the tv adaptation was better than the book. The initial book storyline was there (involving the ubiquitous Russians), but the series' storyline was fleshed out quite a bit more and had a dual storyline involving the vice president's daughter. I must say that having watched the series first I did picture Gabriel Basso in my mind as I was reading, even though he is 6"" shorter than book Peter.",9
North America,"I had never heard of this show; I watched it after I saw it was a new show trending on Netflix, so I decided to give it a go, and I'm glad I did.The Night Agent is a fast-paced thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat; it didn't take me long to get hooked.A good thriller needs a good cast and a decent script with twists and plenty of action; The Night Agent doesn't disappoint. I ended up binge-watching the series.There is plenty of action, but thankfully this show doesn't rely solely on gunshots, fight scenes and big explosions. The plot kept me guessing, yet it was not a ridiculous storyline and was very well written.It's one of the best shows released by Netflix in a while; there wasn't an episode I did not enjoy, and I'm delighted to learn there will be a second season.",10
North America,"I started watching episode 1 which throws you straight into the action and then just doesn't stop. I was hooked and watched the first six episodes back to back.The next day I watched the final four episodes to its satisfying conclusion. This is the best action series I've seen since 24 hours. There are many twists and turns in the plot keeping you guessing who is to be trusted throughout.The actors mostly unknown faces previously are all convincing, the script and direction is excellent and it looks to be an expensive production unlike many other cheap budget action films I've suffered recently. I only hope there is a follow up series as good as season 1!",9
North America,"Good premise, bad writing and development. Who in this world would believe that a high rank officer of the White House will allow a low level ""treason"" suspect and an outsider, to conduct an extraoficial investigation that involves a possible terrorist attack.On the other hand, lately there is a misconception that a strong woman needs to be rude and arrogant, that has to be always right and no one should question her decisions, even if they are stupid, but she can questions everyone else's. This line of character writing has no sense at all.The story base was very good, loved the first episode, stopped watching in the middle of the 3; continued few weeks after just because was lazy and didn't want to spend 1 hour something to watch, and after 2 more episodes, decided to end the season because it's Holy Friday and I just want to rest. Good series for a nothing to do I'm lazy day, otherwise is a waste of time.",5
North America,Story line is a good one ....but the horrible acting made it almost unbearable to watch...luckily only 10 eposides so just dragged it out. Story had so much potential and the twists were interesting and not so cliché but the acting my God. Seemed like I'm watching some kind of acting class ....very amature acting. Hopefully replaced cast if by any chance it gets renewed for another season. All in all not so bad worth a watch just not edge of seat binge worthy. Caught me checking how much time left on each eposide far too many times. Potential for another season for sure let's see if they can dish out something better then this below average show.,6
North America,"I'm three episodes in, and I can already tell this thing is at least four episodes too long. Maybe six. I may have to skip ahead to episode 10 just to see how it all works out.If this thing was all plot and no characters it might be tolerable. There's a scene where the characters return to the Scene of the Crime and one reminisces about how she used to play hide and seek in that room. NOTHING about that scene rings true. There's a subplot about the (inept) killers and how one of them wishes for a normal life, and I swear, if one of them doesn't kill the other before the show is over, I will be sorely disappointed.The screenwriter is using the Big Book of Clichés, and not even a recent volume. It's awash in a sea of tropes. The main character joined the FBI because/in sprite of his father being a suspected traitor who ""died in a car accident"" before he could clear his name. I HOPE we find out his father was murdered, or this is a massive red herring. (Note: The whole things tastes of herring.) The hero himself is suspected of planning a transit explosion because why? TMZ said so. There's not a scene that isn't predictable, or is believable.The book that this series is based on is 432 pages long. The series is 10 hours long. You could probably get through the book in half that time.",6
North America,"Watching a clueless bumpkin pretending to be an agent, ex special ops, a cop or soldier will cause you to disenfranchise your audience who are not similarly clueless bumpkins.Get firearms training if you're going to play a role that involves firearms.You cannot realize how painful it is to watch someone with zero training or skills pretend to be something they're clearly not.As we've seen with petulant man child Alec Baldwin, a lack of firearms training can also be deadly.If you're going to include firearms in your script, make sure they behave realistically and the operator can effectively manipulate them.It is literally like watching a chimpanzee saw a steering wheel side to side pretending to drive.",1
North America,Netflix had been bringing out bummers all of last year and with Night Agent they seem to have come out of that rut. There is some fine action and a whole lot of decent story telling on the way. Netflix also tries to keep it simple with a lot of simple cliches peppered here and there.Even though some of the twists are so cliched the obvious ones. Don't leave you disappointed because of the way in which the story is told. On the whole it's a decent watch and the way it ended Netflix definitely thought it would make the cut as a season 2 is probably on the cards. I would recommend this for fans of action and suspense. A good one time watch.,8
North America,"DIane Farr and the VP are in on the conspiracy and it is easy guessed in ep1 and revealed in ep6. However,r eps 7-10 which I have not watched seem to play out with a story within a story. The 1st 5 mins of ep1 is great and then total crash a burn.You want the two assassins to win and kill everyone so this would just end. The search for proof is something out of. It is reminds me of The Da Vinci Code movie but less interesting. Many back stories on each eps does give you a bit of information on each character but nothing that makes you care. The quest remains in ep7-10 if the president was involved so I continue to watch and determine if S2 is worth exploring if they have it.",4
North America,"I really tried to like this show. That's not to say it wasn't entertaining, but it just didn't do it for me. So many things to say but it all boils down to a very bad story line, which caused bad acting (especially the Diane Farr actor).I try not to be an accuracy snob but the entire story hedging on a top secret classic rotary phone with no buttons is ridiculous. Also, the White House Chief of staff having her own little lapdog FBI agent? Come on.It's not all bad though. There's good action, good thrill throughout which kept me coming back to finish the season. Good pace as well. I'm not sold on a season two.",4
North America,"The Night Agent is an unrealistic and knowledge-bereft, flat character-based, action-fiction centering on a low-level, yet punctual, FBI agent who works in the basement of the White House, for some odd reason, for the singular purpose of manning a phone that could be manned anywhere in the world that never rings so that s middle-man FBI agent can then dial 911 for the caller, thereby delaying a critical response from emergency services -- until the night that it does, propelling him into a unrealistic slow moving and pointless conspiracy that we're promised (or warned?) ultimately leads all the way to the Oval Office of a White House which is occupied by a political appointees clerk who busts the balls of the Intelligence services because they somehow know better. Forgetting that the real FBI is currently an incompetent yet political branch in the real world, this agent who saved hundreds of people from a bomb on the subway was somehow demoted because he had words with appears to be an internet TMZ. This international conspiracy thriller that takes place between FOUR characters will have you on the edge of your night's sleep. Unfortunately, what must be budget cuts or a pre-occupation with covering for the friends of Jeffery Epstein, no additional FBI agents could be spared to save the city?, world?, a small pre-K class? From becoming the next victim of this husband and wife terrorist team! If there's ANYTHING ELSE, short of a test pattern, I'd recommend you watch it instead.I'm not sure what show these other people watched and then rated, but there's NO WAY it could've been this garbage.Oh, and the unnecessary number of times the girl's name ""Rose"" is used in every other sentence of dialogue coming out of the main character's mouth rivals that of the pointless and annoying number of times Leonardo De Crapio used in Titanic.",1
North America,"Not very often, but every once in a while, I will see something about which I had few if any real expectations that is way better than I expected. The Netflix limited series, ""The Night Agent,"" is just such a ""something."" I was unfamiliar with both the novel by Matthew Quirk on which it's based, and also the two leads, Gabriel Basso as FBI agent Peter Sutherland Jr. (also the son of a deceased FBI agent-and a suspected traitor), and Luciane Buchanan as young cybersecurity expert Rose Larkin, whose aunt and uncle are actually being murdered as our story begins. Peter and Rose are the only characters we're pretty sure we (and they) can trust, as we are informed that (a) White House mole(s) is/are involved in the two deaths and the subsequent lethal pursuit of Rose. It could be either of Peter's bosses: the WH Chief of Staff, Diane Farr, (played to absolute perfection by Hong Chau!), or FBI Deputy Director Hawkins (portrayed by the reliably dislikable Robert Patrick). Or it could be the chief of the Secret Service, Ben Almora, or Vice President Ashley Redfield, or might be either one of the two Secret Service agents assigned to protect Redfield's loose cannon of a daughter, Maddie, who is convincingly played by Sarah Desjardins.By now you should've surmised this is an action thriller with a lot of suspects and a variety of moving parts. I will admit to being engrossed in these different characters and their evolving relationships with one another right from the start of the first of ten episodes. I can usually predict where most plots are headed, but this one-well, not so much. I rate the show a strong 8/10 stars, subtracting a star because Basso is only so-so in his lead role, other than realistic hand-to-hand fight scenes; but Buchanan's Rose more than makes up for him by evolving from cowering in a closet from would-be assassins to bum-rushing a heavily armed one and shoving said assassin off scaffolding to a bloody death. Peter spends at least four episodes protecting Rose heroically (and energetically), and then their roles are at least partially reversed and Rose saves Peter from more than one deadly attack (once, memorably, swinging a 2x4). So anyway, by the 10th episode we're hiding in the back of a Range Rover and converging on Camp David trying to stop an explosion (as it happens, two high-intensity ones!). A satisfying ending and clear setup for a S2 for ""The Night Agent.""",8
North America,"This is a Netflix funded burn notice without the plausibility or action. Every character has extra drama without the benefit of actual depth. The entire series is based around an incomprehensibly incompetent FBI agent who clearly is inept and his will be girlfriend who is also too naive to survive any actual life events. If cosmopolitan wrote a spy thriller, this is it. I can't imagine there is enough depth to create a second season or even attempt to spread these characters any thinner than they already are. Anyway, would recommend if you don't care about plausible events or general common sense.",2
North America,"This show is full of action and secrets. It starts with a murder and a top secret room that has a phone. The person behind the phone is the main character along with the person who calls it. The show is good and worth watching. You have your typical president, vice president, other higher ups doing notty things. Typical conspiracy theory writing about things that could happen but very unlikely. Is their a room in the white house that ops call in for help probably. However that agent would never leave the room to rescue someone. Do I think high level officials do corrupt things probably most humans are corruptible and flawed.Either way the show is worth watching over a weekend.",8
North America,"I am shocked by the bad reviews, thet dosent make any sense. An amazing Series that will keep you stuck to the screen! Amazing script great actors highly recommended. I finish seeing the entire season in less than 48 hours. There are a lot of surprising twists in the plot. If you liked thw series 24 with Jack Bauer you would defintalily like the night agent with Peter Satherland. This series easikiy get round 10 score - it gots everything. So if you recently looked for a good and enjoyable thriller this is the series for you so go ahead and watch it. Hopefully, there will be more seasons up next. ??",10
North America,"This had such promise but this was undermined by the lazy writing, the incredulous story strands and some not inconsiderable need to suspend disbelief.Luciane Buchanan as Rose was the standout star of the series, with Hong Chau deliciously likeable as the f-bomb dropping Chief of Staff and the bonkers Ellen played by Eve Harlow.Sadly most of the actors seemed to dial in their performances with the ""thriller by numbers"" script, I often expected them to break the fourth wall to explain what was going on such was the ""narration"" like writing.What could have been a great series was severely let down by so many aspects, it's bizarre that it's been recommissioned.",3
North America,"I went in with no expectations and was pleasantly surprised to see a great political action thriller from Netflix. Its a rarity these days that such good shows exist in Netflix that doesn't take us viewers for granted. It's obvious the makers didn't take the lazy route and the standard shows in writing, acting and the action and the execution. I could have easily watched the whole show in one sitting. Special mention to the lead actors - Gabriel Basso & Luciane, their charisma and acting keeps you hooked to the end. I for one am looking forward to a second season. I never thought I'd enjoy to this much. Give this a go, you'll want more of it by the end.",9
North America,"It wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. The actor who plays Pete seemed a little bland. Like one of those actors who doesn't really have range and just seems like a mongaloid. The girl was decent. She showed some range. You believed her performance. DB Woodside is always a win. I love these political thrillers. It opens your eyes to the things that could be possible in real life. But I won't make this review political. I thought it would have more intense and explosive action sequences. The dialogue was smart and I thought the plot twisted in ways I wasn't expecting. Tbh I thought I had it pegged out from the beginning. However it's nothing like shows like ""The Old Man"" or ""Bourne Identity"". I love Shawn Ryan and was a huge fan of ""The Shield"". However this wasn't even close to being as good as that show.",7
North America,"It was a little above average however - Netflix movies and shows are getting to be easy to predict as essentially any white man is going to be the villain or a bad guy in the end (other than main protagonist if they are white). Same here and it makes it hard to make an interesting plot / anything surprising.Overall, other than the plot there were good action scenes, but ok dialogue. The main character is likeable despite his dialogue. Many scenarios seemed unrealistic/ made little sense if you thought about it. If there is a second season the secret agent angle looks interesting. In that season I hope the drop the Netflix tropes.",1
North America,"I understand that this is just a show (on Netflix) and not a big blockbuster with a big budget that could afford a crackpot team of experienced and intelligent writers. But still. You'd think that they could have cooked up a better script than this. The lines that they have some of the characters say just make me cringe. For example, when Rose (Luciane Buchanan) learns that her aunt and uncle have been killed (which she witnessed, by the way), her response is, ""No. Everyone loved them."" And this line is not delivered as one might expect: with great anguish or tears or anger. No. She just says it rather woodenly. When the agent (Gabriel Basso) is attacked by a pair of conspiracy-addled morons, their lines and their acting are just so cringe-worthy. Then there is the very obvious attempt by the writers to craft a situation where the Handsome Agent (and yes, he's very handsome and hunky) gets put in very close situations with a pretty female, the woman that he is supposed to protect. This just smacks of cliché to me. We see it over and over and over. In fact, after just one episide, I feel that I have already seen this show and I don't want to watch the rest of it.",4
North America,"I managed to get through the whole series just to see what the end would be. What annoyed me most was the moments between characters that dragged the show and added no value to the main plot. The moments between the ""killers"" of them wanting a regular life. Why add that to the show !?! Moments between the agents guarding VP daughter, why did we need that !?! I was always annoyed at how two of the most important people in the main character life dies , she never cries, never mourns ?? Very weird . She annoying. The agent she's with acts like some inexperienced teenager though likable. It's watchable but it's weak. Plain n simple .",5
North America,"So the premise is that they think he may
have planted the bomb after he, chases down the guy what did it and can give the authorities a pretty good disruption BTW , once you saw the close - up ofthe snake tattoo.... You Knew he was going to lose him ... so predictable it was annoying .Now it goes onto 1 year later..... let's give

Let's not interview the lady on the train who saved
his daughter's life or the man who
saw him find the bomb...really?And let's have 2 thugs try and beat him up because everyone beatb up FBI agents
right... Lol
get some writers who were born before 2O10 please...I can't watch this show after 35minutes into it.",2
North America,"It's alright. The acting and the whole cross departmental conflict feels super hoaky. It just feels forced and cheesy and over played. Is that really what it's like? I suppose it probably is, it just feels really forced.Honestly that's all I really have so far, but the app insists on me giving you six hundred characters (not including spaces apparently which is just silly). I do not need six hundred characters to get my point across, one hundred characters is plenty enough.Lorem Ipsum bah dhghd bccs disagree dig fnd jkkg hbansnn when.

North America,"Main Story is entertaining, Side Storys are so-so, some even completely out of place and add nothing of value to the story, others are decent...The Who is who of good and bad guys in this plot wasnt really too much a mystery, even with some effort to blur it plotwise. Some decisions taken by characters to get the plot along seem quite stupid or out of character, which was disappointing - but thats todays studios and storywriters.Some characters:POTUS - ofc it has to be a woman, it actually adds something to the story, but overall she is not really of consequence - the actress doesnt really has too much screentime, given performance is decent.Chief of Staff - a typical netflix diversity cast, ive no idea who thought that this actress could pull off this role. My honest Opinion: At no point i got convinced that this character could command others, she talks tough, she seems clever but i dont really believed it - hard contrast to the female lead btw - this is were this series lost most of its potential imo.Assassins Pair - interesting choice, a bit cliche and wierd side-story to reenforce a already establish psychotic psyche on the female - overall good harmony between these 2 and good enough side character depthMale and Female Lead - they carried the show, good synergy, overall good performance, established characters with strengths and flaws - BUT WHY FOR CHRIST SAKE...why HAS there always to be a romance between the lead actors?... EVERY GODDAMN TIME - its just unnecessary, it adds nothing of value, its just in the way...Overall Summary:
Not the best, not the worst series, u can definitely enjoy the show - much thanks to both lead actors, hope to see more of them in similar roles.",8
North America,"While the plot line was mildly entertaining and interesting, the acting in this series takes a new level of bad. There is more animation and life in a Kohl's mannequin than the actors chosen for the series. Instead of trying to make sure he had every hue in the diversity rainbow he really should have spent the money and hired real actors. Shame on you Shawn Ryan. The man who created The Shield comes up with crap like this 20 years later. The plot line 2 was far-fetched in many cases, and the series was about three shows to long. It is difficult to believe that Netflix is going to have a season two of this. I truly hope they get totally new actors. Rarely do I root for the bad guys to kill all the characters, but in this case, none of the characters had any socially redeeming characteristics. And the female lead to play the presidents, Chief of Staff was especially awful. Her bland face delivering lines was almost painful to watch. Likewise, the hero of the story is not someone that you would really give a darn about.",2
North America,"I enjoyed this series for the plot, twists and turns, and fast pace. The production value is good and the script, while full of holes, keeps things moving at a good clip. But boy is some of the acting bad!Gabriel Basso basically carries the whole thing as Agent Peter (Sutherland, Sunderland, I can't recall). He's very solid, charismatic enough but not too swaggering. The actress who plays the Veep's daughter is quite good, as is the one who plays the sexy evil hench-woman. Most of the rest are OK.But the grieving tech genius AKA love interest, Rose, the Chief Of Staff and the Secret Service agent who protects the Veep's daughter? None of them can act their way out of a paper bag! And they're all key characters. It's a perpetual problem. They don't improve as the show goes on, either. I don't get it. Do they have a bad casting agent, a bad director or could they just not afford decent actors?Anyway, Basso carries his co-star enough that there is decent chemistry between Rose and Peter. So, the show works. But it's frustrating to watch so many of the actors struggle to emote. So, watch for the action and plot twists. And Gabriel Basso.",8
North America,"Peter Sutherland stops a train bombing, then gets blamed and harassed by a conspiracy-theory group called ""the Patriots"". He gets a call from someone who narrowly escapes a murder, which leads to multiple plot twists and turns.The story could be interesting, but it should have been a 5 or 6 episode series. Instead it drags on with juvenile dialog between the main characters, and interruptions to explain back story after back story. The relationship between the main characters develops as expected, and the professionals in the government do not behave in believable ways. Like the secret service agents on the case who stop to have a personal conversation while turning their back on the people and location they are investigating. Disappointing.",4
North America,"Spoiler Alert***
I'm not sure what people expect in a fictional spy thriller. I mean it could've been written better but it could've been worst and I feel the show maintained the pace it started on then speed up a bit.Yes, glaring improbabilities - from lack of security and facial recognition not picking up the face of a man (Peter) accused in kidnapping- what are we expecting - just sit back and enjoy the impractical monster-ride. Hey laugh and shake your if you have to but I enjoyed the show immensely and I have only one thing to ask?Can the producers do a spinoff prequel with Ellen and Dale. To begin with I can't remember any assassin kidnapping a baby just to be convincing just to get in a home. Those two were ridiculous but deadly. I know they seemed a little flat but I think the show itself - through directing instructions may have reigned in on range of emotion. Give them their own Origin limited series . Thanks!!! And yes I recommend this for those who want to binge for the night.",8
North America,"The action scenes in this show are credible but this is no Jason Bourne thriller. The characters become unbelievable in the second episode and go downhill from there. The Night Action storyline could have worked if anyone on the production team had ever worked with or around sensitive compartmented information (SCI) procedures. Or sensitive compartmented information facilities (SCIF). This show is the result of someone's imagination of how such things might work.Direction is lazy and the acting shows it. Both protagonists and antagonists are working too hard to show their credentials. The only redeeming quality of this show is the action choreography. It's not bad at all, and would thoroughly entertain my 15-year old nephew if he could make it past the dreadful dialogue. Adults used to Bourne, Reacher and Ryan probably drop it after the 2nd episode.",2
North America,"Tried to watch this with my brother last night. And, It was another Netflix abortion! How are these people still employed?The Good: The production values were competent. And, I think the original author was involved.The Bad: The short answer is everything not listed in the good.The writing was atrocious! It was painfully bad and hugely annoying. My suspension of disbelief felt like it was gang raped in a prison shower scene. In order for fiction to work there has to be a grounding in reality. There was no grounding, nor any reality. The characters did what they wanted for no reason and never acted like any human beings on the face of the Earth... ever. There are middle school student writers doing better, more realistic work.The acting was subpar. I know these jokers had no script, but still... The words that came out of their mouths made everything worse. I felt so sorry for Robert Patrick. There have been actors in the past, given terrible scripts, who were able to elevate the words through talent. Peter Cushing is a wonderful example. There was no such talent here, not even a little! They just made it worse!!It hurts to even think about the time I spent watching this mess.Do yourself a favor, unless you're super stoned or about to pass out drunk, give this a miss. The best thing about this show is the advertising and the artwork.",3
North America,"Like others stated, the writing is very bad: Top secret stuff is discussed everywhere, with anyone. Not very believable. Or maybe it is, in these crazy times.The female lead is especially badly written. And also, the actor is very bad. Kind of like a budget Michelle Rodriguez: 1 facial expression all the time. And it's always grim. Even towards the guy that saves her life multiple times.Writers need to understand: this is not how you portrait a strong independent woman. This is how you portrait an annoying, know-it-all, bad mood pain in the butt, that the audience doesn't care for.And what's with all the out of place swearing? Cringe af! Not even in the heyday of macho cinema in the 80s/90s, would this have passed for cool or dope.This is a missed opportunity. Because the first episode was promising. But the female lead and the bad writing ruin it all.As also other people stated, Netflix cancels a ton of shows that the audience does enjoy. To, in return, give us this kind of cringefest that is really not enjoyable, even if you are open minded.Thus: If ever netflix cancels pw-sharing in my country, I'm cancelling my subscription.",3
North America,"There's action series and then there's B & C grade series. This falls in the C grade category with a joke made out of something like Secret Service and the Whitehouse. The female lead does everything in this, from TED talks, to threatening and going against the White House chief of staff, medical assistant, save the hero(a FBI agent), fill assassins and what not! Ends up even saving the negative character by ""putting a pillow on her wound"" to ensure she gets saved and gets Jail????
The assassins kill everyone with ease and FBI agents, cops, other spies can't defend, but who saves the day? You guessed it, the female lead.The female assassin is brought on by the other guy just a couple of years back, is lame as hell, but then also turns into a sniper, all the while being one of the most silliest assassins we've seen these days.I mean, I don't get what's with the crazy load of bad acting, clubbed with a sorry story, it's like everyone tells off the president, her chief of staff and whoever else while being civilian, a basic agent or whatever.There's hardly anyone addressing the president as ""Madam President""????
The amount of silly stuff is comedy gold!I see other ratings, but have suffered with this, it's what could pass off maybe 15-20years ago, but baffled at how high this is rated now??
Watch at your own peril????",1
North America,"The script is basic, there are way too many plot conveniences and character protections, furthermore the actions characters are forced to carry out venture into the unbelievable. However, despite the series suffers from a lack of originality and limits itself to recycling genre clichés, the story is agile and intense, which makes it an attractive option for lovers of espionage. It's about a conspiracy movie/series throwback involving two lethal killers, a bombing in a subway, a mole within the White House and a newbie FBI agent who's in over his head. Well acted though lacking in originality. Not that bad.",7
North America,"I understand that taste is subjective, but the fact that some have given this show a rating of anything below a 7 just goes to show how spoiled some people are, and how demanding they've become in what they expect from a show. For sure, TNA isn't going to change lives or mindsets, but it was well put together, the two lead characters had excellent, natural rapport and were absolutely NOT just a couple of pretty faces; they acted really well. Most of the supporting cast were great too - with the exception of the assassins, who were just awful in a ""trying-too-hard-to-be-different"" kind of way. The writing was on point, as was the plot and pace, with sufficient twists to keep you interested. Give this show a chance; ignore the 4 and 5 ratings - very unfair, to the point of being ridiculous. It really should be around an 8, but I've given it a 10 to offset some the spitefully low ratings some other hard-to-please people have given. Watch the show.",10
North America,Try not to look into the reviews too much as you'll be wasting away. I'm so glad I watched this as it's to date the best series of the year so far. I loved it and it would be truly magnificent if we can be ever so lucky and get a season 2 to see where the journey ends. I was looking long and heard to find a series similar to Designated Survivor and this just tops it all off it is brilliant.I hope you enjoy the watch like I did because I simply couldn't take my eyes off the screen. Call me a conspiracy theorist but I bet a lot goes on in the real world so maybe we got a glimpse of the real world.,10
North America,I was reluctant to watch but so glad I did!There are very few series today that would keep you in the edge of your seat and this one does it quite well. The acting is solid and the action is non stop from start to finish. I loved the stories and the chemistry between the characters and here is a rating for some of the key elements:Chemistry between characters: 8.5/10 especially liked the two assassins doomed love storyAction sequences: 9/10 everything is so well set up and can be made a movieActing: 9/10. Yes there are some defaults there but overall very solid and casting is perfect especially with the secret service detail.Story line: 9/10 because of how it unravels and keeps you engaged in every episode. Yes there are some weak story lines but it all comes together beautifullyI hope there is season 2 coming and I really hope they keep it fresh and good like this season.Go ahead and watch it and disregard all the negative reviews.,9
North America,"It's interesting, it took me about a week to finish this show, and when I started it was an 8.1 on Netflix and now it's a 7.6. The show reminded me of 24, even with some of the old school major network type production values which aren't quite up to Netflix's normal standard but not terrible. It was a compelling story with twist and turns that kept pulling you along.The story and the overall production is an 8 at least, but there are WAY too many plot holes and faux pas that are jarring for such an otherwise well done series. From the beginning of the story there is constant tension and the main characters, Peter and Rose, are in constant danger. So many of the faux pas relate to casual occurrences in a story that otherwise was filled with tension and drama and Peter and Rose being with high alert. To wit:1. Ep 4 Peter and crew were so casual preparing to invade home of killers. Rose just sitting in car in plain sight. They didn't even put her in and make sure doors were locked.2. Rose just sitting in plain sight in cafe, no effort to disguise even after Peter texted her about a BOLO.3. Peter stealing Diane Farr's passcard while she was in the night agent room. Her first instinct when she left would've been to pick it up since she always puts it down. And who puts down such an important card all the time??? No way. You wear it around your neck.4. Killer couple goes into unoccupied home for sale and nonchalantly key in the passcode on the interior alarm console to deactivate the alarm. As if the owners would not get a notification on their phone about the code being turned off. Absolutely ridiculous.5. Lorna also has a keypad inside her home. I guess everybody in this show has technology from 10 to 20 years ago.6. Lorna wears a knife around her calf, and keeps shotguns by the front door and grabs one when somebody knocks on the door, but doesn't have a gun nearby when she's sitting in her living room qnd intruders come to the house. Nuts.7. Peter comes in a hotel room and doesn't lock the door when he and Rose are in danger.8. VP approaches his daughter's dorm room and ask the guarding secret service agent if his daughter is in her dorm room. What do you think, the agent is neglecting her duty and guarding an empty room?9. And why did you come to her room if you didn't know whether she was there?10. And where are YOUR secret service agents? Nowhere in sight as you approach the dorm room.11. Ep 6, Cisco says it took him two months on Bumble to convince a girl for a first date, and the first date was going to be at his apartment! Completely asinine.12. Ep 10, Arrington finds the bomb with 3 minutes and 43 seconds remaining, but instead of taking it into the woods where nobody is, she tells people to evacuate the building. That is nuts.ABOUT MY REVIEWS:I do not include a synopsis of the film/show -- you can get that anywhere and that does not constitute a meaningful review -- but rather my thoughts and feelings on the film that hopefully will be informative to you in deciding whether to invest 90-180 minutes of your life on it.My scale: 1-5 decreasing degrees of ""terrible"", with 5 being ""mediocre"" 6- OK. Generally held my interest OR had reasonable cast and/or cinematography, might watch it again 7 - Good. My default rating for a movie I liked enough to watch again, but didn't rise to the upper echelons 8- Very good. Would watch again and recommend to others 9- Outstanding. Would watch over and over; top 10% of my ratings 10 - A classic. (Less than 2% receive this rating). For Lifetime Movies for Chicks (LMFC), drop the above scale by 3 notches. A 6 is excellent and 7 almost unattainable.",7
North America,"The series is just what you expect, but in a bad way. If you have seen any movie about White House betrayal and espionage, you know the plot and the villains of the whole series in detail after 20 minutes.The whole thing is absolutely medicore except for the acting, which is slightly worse.Filming, directing are OK, fighting scenes are also OK except for scenes where people are playing tough agent parts for politically correctness reasons only.The only positive surprise is that although conversations are not exceptional, sometimes these is a witty response that is really original and funny.Expect many movies like this once AIs will generate scripts and virtual actors.",6
North America,"Being an avid spy thriller enthusiast, i am quite choosy of the series or movies that I watch in this genre. Well in this case, I can definitely say that it's one of the best spy thrillers of recent times. There are plenty of boring, same type of series/movies being released every month in this genre but trust me its built different.Highly unpredictable with 'n' number of plot twists and with strong+Convincing acting.The storyline is very good and the end does justice to the entire series. The sub plots are foolproof with almost no loop holes. I liked the fact that the story has many dimensions to ponder over and almost each episode has it's own hero. All I can say is, welldone!",9
North America,"There are thousand of spy movies around, it's really hard to create any twists that can surprise the audience. The great thing about this show is, it just focus on the story telling, the journey of the 2 main leads. It doesn't try too hard to come up with any crazy twist that doesn't make sense just for the sake of shock value. The story progress natural, it's exciting to watch.Even though it's a typical perfect hero saving the world, I'm fine with that because there are such perfect human exist at a younger age.The show is exciting to watch and the action is really good. Love the cast, every one is great. I binge the whole thing in one go.",8
North America,"I enjoyed the first episode, however the series quickly went downhill.Beyond the the two main characters, the acting and script are horrible. The antagonist are cartoonish in dialog and acting as well.After watching four episode we have decided to remove it from our que and not watch again.I have no idea how someone could find this enjoyable.And, I can not believe that it has been renewed by Netflix. That is my opinon and I am sticking to it.Apparently, you have to write multiple paragraphs to have your review posted, but honestly I seen no reason to exert any more than the minumun effort.",2
North America,"Why all the hate? I get it - the acting isn't Oscar worthy, the effects aren't a masterpiece. However, what you do get is a fast-paced, easy-watching show that leaves the viewer thoroughly entertained.If you want a decent show to watch, choose this and you can thank me later!Here are the 5 things I loved most:
1 - the twists and turns to the series aren't completely predictable
2 - (potential spoilers) - the good guys and the bad guys get hurt and killed. None of the usual 'heroes can dodge all the bullets and kill with 1'
3 - (potential spoilers) - there are very few times where I was left screaming at the TV due to a stupid decision made
4 - all of the characters (minus the VP's daughter) were genuinely likeable
5 - there were no episodes that just filled time. Each one lead to something more.Enjoy!",9
North America,"The series as a whole isn't bad, but it's not great. Everything about is just mid level enjoyable. It starts out with an interesting mystery. Why were two seemingly normal people killed and who did it? Obviously this turns into your usual political thriller, minus the over the top political messaging moat shows have these days. The action scenes were good, but there could have been more. People showed injuries after them. There wasn't any messaging that I could see leaning one way or the other politically which was nice. But other than that, the show was just there, not awesome or amazing. Coming from the guy who made the Shield, one of the best shows ever, we got this giant bowl of blah. The last episode descends into Fast and Furious levels of suspension of disbelief. The main character should have died six times over and yet doesn't. Overall it's okay.",5
North America,"I must say, though not great, this was an enjoyable watch for me. The writing and story were entertaining, even if they did require some leaps in logic that fell short. The two leads worked well together and had good rapport and chemistry; I look forward to seeing them in season two. On the whole it was fast paced, and the tension kept me interested in what was happening.On the down side, that same tension sometimes took too long to build before it was released. Additionally, the assassins received too much screen time and character development. Past knowing that they were hired guns for the bad guys, I didn't care about them at all. Yet, for some reason, the writers wanted us to get to know them.Even though I liked the series quite a bit, one of the things that left me a bit cold was the trail of bodies... seems like just too many people died over the course of ten episodes.",7
North America,"Okay, cards on the table, I'm only about 10 minutes into the first episode, but I was truly blown away by the lack of realism in one of the first scenes. The MC is sitting on a bench, waiting for an emt to check him out, when he spots the bad guy in the crowd. He says more than once, ""that's the guy"" and then runs after him, but none of the many police officers around follow him or even engage at all, including the cop who was JUST talking to him? And then he gets into a fight with the guy a couple blocks away, and fires his GUN several times, and STILL no cops come rushing over to assist? I mean, there's suspending disbelief and then there's just nonsense, and so far this is falling squarely in the latter category. There should have been at least three cops following him the second he identified the guy.",4
North America,"I don't think the acting is as bad as the script and direction make it out to be. The supporting cast seems like they would be solid if they had some good material and leadership, but the main character, later by Gabriel Basso, is miscast. He comes off as wooden; boring.I watched Perry Mason on HBO directly after this show. They have the same score on IMDB currently, but I'm telling you, if Perry Mason is a 7.6 then The Night Agent is a 4. The quality of these two shows are not even close to comparable.The plot and subsequent actions require much suspension of reality.The good: A strong cast of female characters in non-traditional roles, led by Fola Evans-Akingbola. Still, I'm not sure if it's enough to give this one a go.",4
North America,"I don't normally write reviews, but after laboring through a few episodes of this and seeing that it had a 7.6 rating, I felt compelled.It must be bots. There's no human who would watch this and go ""yeah, that's a 10"". I understand that opinions differ, and I don't expect everyone to share my opinion of this show being complete garbage, but the number of 10/10 ratings is an obvious absurdity.See for yourself. Watch the first episode, and realize that the first 20 minutes are as good as it's going to get. It's all down hill from there, baby.After a few episodes, I walked away with a renewed appreciation of my own free will.The poor writing, the inept actors sprinkled throughout, the saturation of clichés that hit the ear like a satirical copy-pasta... it's just too much. A child could write something with more depth. The suspension of belief required for this movie to not seem deliberately absurdist is on the same level as the Tooth Fairy and Easter Bunny. The whole time I was thinking, ""surely the main character is about to wake from some bizarre dream"", yet it blundered on.I'm sure some could enjoy this series, but not I. Despite myself, I'm sure no adult-minded flesh-and-blood person could possibly think it was flawless.",1
North America,"First, everyone sounds like they are wearing retainers. If the production wants to test mouth worn microphones, they should do it with a B movie or train the actors how to sound natural. Also, they should go ahead and fire the consultant that was in charge of the military personnel. The marines tending Marine One can't even snap a salute or wear uniforms that fit. The show is good.... but it was executed badly by a direction team that just barely failed. The actors are MOSTLY good....the VP's daughter is too dramatic, and she seems to be forcing it. The Secret Service agents are not believable, and they killed off the only one I liked. Other than that, not bad.",7
North America,"Netflix often confuses me with its production. While they put great amount of effort in the visuals, often the script falls short. The night agent sadly falls under the same category.The cast is not bad, I enjoyed watching most of the characters in this show, apart from self absorbed vice-presidents daughter's security detail which does not lose any opportunity to throw awful annoying punch lines and show everyone how she is really good at her job. Another set of characters that seem a bit lost are the least efficient hitmen on the planet. Their story seems absolutely not necessary and relevant to the plot. It's a poor filler that leads nowhere.The WH escape scene is hilarious, and although shot well, it just does not fit in the show like this. It is not an action show, it is a spy/conspiracy Jack Ryan kind of plot. You can't pull out a few scenes that are complete nonsense and think you can get away with it.It would be fair to mention some positive aspects of this show, and why it can be worth your time. The pace is good, directing is excellent and the score fits well and adds to the tone. If you don't want to overthink the plot and character decisions, you will enjoy it.",6
North America,"First of all I'd like to say that I don't think this series is meant for high critical thinking and top class writing, I think it's just an Action flick that kinda feels like reading a nice James Patterson Crime Novel or the like , It's not meant to be a super clever series like True Detective but kind of something like Reacher which as much as the series has mild writing and predictability, the fight scenes are okay and the action can be fun, it's certainly not a 8-10 series in terms of quality but it's pretty good for casual watching to say the least, It's the kind of shows you can watch with anyone and most people enjoy and that's okay.",7
North America,"This series feels like the TV series 24 - very fast pace and exciting, creating suspense one after the other. You will get hooked up since ep 1. There will be different questions you have in mind after watching first few ep and you need to be patient to find out little by little through out the episodes even until the last episode.I finish this series in 3 nights - I am so engaged to watch!The only bad thing is too many interesting characters need to die - could they just be injured and live? Would love to build up certain characters and learn more their stories.I also wish there will be more hand to hand combat but this is just me!",9
North America,First. I love spy/ FBI movies and tv shows. This is one of the worst I have ever seen. The writing and the acting are terrible. Mostly the writing. You can feel the actors cringe as they say certain lines. There are some redeeming qualities like Rose is a strong character but her lines are awful. Not the actresses fault. The hero has the same issue. The villains are flat and one diminutional. I honestly don't understand the positive reviews. Are people just bored. It was like watching a train wreck. Hong Chau was terrible and completely unbelievable. As was the actor who played the VP. The love story between the assassins was just filler and unnecessary. I wonder what is going on at Netflix. So so bad.,1
North America,"I guess there is only one group of people who are not offended by the lack of good writing, the countless plot holes, the stupid decision making of all characters: fans of deep state conspiracy theories. Yes, it is fast paced and a bit thrilling, enough to keep you going for a while, but there is always some insult to the intelligence of the viewer around every corner in this show and it makes me angry. The by far worst thing though is this ridiculous love story between these assassins. Okay, I get it. These people are usually faceless drones in any show, giving them personalities could, in theory, be nice for a change. But please, not like that. I just skipped these parts. They felt completely out of place. I could go on and on about all the glaring holes in the storyline but that won't convince anyone to watch or not watch the show. So, to sum up, I keep it simple: this show gets worse the more you think about it. If you prefer not to think, this is for you.",2
North America,"When has anyone been able to see who is driving a in car behind them at night? How do assassins miss the car parked just off the end of the road? Who buckles their seatbelt before starting the car to chase after a target? The Night Agent has weak writing and low believability. So many characters make crappy tactical errors it's embarrassing. I do better counter surveillance walking home from the bar at night. It tries to be mysterious by bouncing around a timeline which only serves to look like it's trying too hard. The acting is good considering the material they were given. Pick a different ""Night"" for better thrills. I suggest the Night Manager.",4
North America,"This is the laziest and most basic screenwriting and terrible acting that I've seen in a while. Took all the worst parts of a CBS drama and mixed it with uninspired ""cinematography"". Get ready to yell at the screen because 90% of the decisions made by the characters, so called professional agents, are devoid of logic and basic intelligence for the sake of the script.Constantly following characters that will essentially have zero impact on your understanding of the character, constant random exposition dumps, 90% of which are completely unnecessary.Fast and furious has better suspension of disbelief than this.Awful.",2
North America,"The leading actor was very well prepared for all the action scenes and obviously he spent lot of time with the gun in the past. The fighting scenes were very moderate and realistic. The script at some point seems like improvised, because some part of the plot were predictable and suddenly took a direction to another predictable outcome, but still was filled with enough intrigue which kept my attention to the final. The acting was good and I think Gabriel Basso has a bright future in front of him. At the end of the day it was one of the best described conspiracy series I've ever watched and it was made realistic in terms of the circumstances and actions that would simulate such an event.",8
North America,"Wow I really liked this show! It was an amazing serie. It was a serie of 10 episodes (plusminus 45/60 min per episode). All together it felt like a big action movie. I thought it was so exciting and refreshing. Good and (new) actors. I feel like Gabriel Basso and Lucian's Buchanan both did a good job. I was also a good script. Most of it was action, a piece of romance and a huge plottwist to me. I couldn't stop watching it and I almost bingewatched it. I didn't even get distracted on my phone.. I would definitely recommend this to everyone. Have fun!.I hope there will be a second season!....",10
North America,"BEST SERIES I HAVE EVER WATCH HOPE SEASON 2 WILL ALSO BE GOOD AS SEASON 1. THE SEARIES HAS THE BEST SCENES ALSO GREAT SUSPENSE TOWARDS THE VIWERS WHICH MAKES ME TO WATCH IT EVERYTIME ON REAPET
I HAD GREAD TIME WATCHING THIS AND NETFLIX IF IT CAN REALESE SUCH SERIES... I KNOW IT WILL GWT ALOT OF SUBCRIBERS EVERYTIME.HOPE WE GET A SERIES THAT HAS A SIMILAR SUSPENCE AS THIS THIS ONE
I LOOK FORWARD FOR THE NEW REALESE OF SEASON 2 OF THIS SERIES OHHHHH MY GOD SO WISH IT COULD BE LOT SOONER THAN THE STIPULATED TIME THAT I FIND ON THE INTERNET.AND THEY DONT CHANGE THE CHARECTERS BECOUSE THAT WOULD BE A BAD MOVE.",10
North America,"This started out as some background noise as my wife and I did chores but quickly became a must watch show for us. For the most part the scenes are pretty predictable but the show kept digging deeper. The only part I didn't enjoy was the few attempted comedy bits but the action was really good.For those giving it bad ratings due to it being predictable, we've all seen White House conspiracy shows in the past and it's difficult to put a new spin on things. I walked into this show expecting it to have poor acting throughout but for the most part enjoyed the acting of almost every single character.",8
North America,"This premise was so promising. I was expecting something akin to ""Bodyguard"" for the US, but what I got was stilted dialog, pedestrian fight scenes and boring car chases. There were glimpses of what could have been-the source material is probably worth checking out-the occasional dose of intrigue and excitement, a touch of suspense here and there. However, it was obvious to me at least that there was no budget for the multiple camera angles and quick shots with handheld cameras that would have given this show the ""Jason Bourne"" treatment that would have made it so much better. It felt like a Season 3 Netflix show instead of a Season 1. Let me explain: Netflix notoriously cancels shows after the third season-they figure the IP is unlikely to draw in new subscribers so they cut the budget to the bare bones, the quality bottoms out and/or they have to film fewer episodes. Honestly, this show would have been so much better if they focused their budget on better production values and fewer episodes. I thought it was cast well and have seen many of the actors do great work in other shows, so the only real explanation is that Netflix did not give them the budget they needed to make a really good show. That's too bad.",5
North America,"As someone who enjoys espionage and cybercrime-themed movies, I was looking forward to ""Night Agent."" However, I was thoroughly disappointed. Despite its 7.6 rating on IMDB, I found this movie to be a complete letdown.Firstly, there were several gaps in the plot that left me confused and wondering what was happening. It seemed like the writers did not fully flesh out the story and left loose ends that were never tied up.Secondly, the acting was less than mediocre. I found it hard to connect with any of the characters, and their interactions often didn't make any sense. It was as if they were reading off a script, with fake emotions attached. Watching it with a spouse, instead of sitting tight & focused, we were often laughing because of that.Thirdly, the technical aspect of security and hacking was complete nonsense.The good things? Visuals and the plot idea. Idea - not its execution.",2
North America,"Nowadays it's so usual to watch the first episode of a new series hoping they got it right, only to get disappointed pretty fast. This show seemed to work almost fine as a political/spy thriller but started piling up clichés and awful characters faster than the speed of light. Peter, the protagonist, is your usual rookie who knows better than his elders, to prove once more that this was written by some millennial. At least the actor playing Peter is decent and his role, albeit predictable, is sort of OK. Unfortunately, the female lead Rose is terrible from every point of view because her acting chops swing from poor to non-existent, she has one stone-faced expression, zero range, and no chemistry with the male lead. As if poor skills weren't enough, her role of entitled, smug, arrogant, know-it-all is absolutely obnoxious. By episode two I wanted the assassins to get her.The Asian lady playing Diane is also wooden and expressionless, with minimal range, except bossy and again, her role is totally unsympathetic. It does not help that her vocabulary is peppered with F-words that don't add ""grit"" to the character, just cheapen it... and her wig is absolutely terrible. Then the assassins are a bad copy of those two in the Americans and THAT show was BRILLIANT, but changing wigs does not equal smart spies as in the Americans. The self-righteous, arrogant female bodyguard is just the icing on this third-rate, rotting cake... and obviously who's guilty, but the compulsory old white males?Apart from the awful bunch of stereotypical leads and supporting, the plot is the usual conspiracy at the top level which will be thwarted by the low-ranking agent and smarty pants Rose. I give it two only because the first episode was watchable, but it went downhill from there.",2
North America,"It isn't the best series but it has a lot of good actors. There's a few questionable actors like the chief of staff and the assassins but other than that the acting is good.By Netflix's recent standard of series, this is a decent one. I think the bad reviews are the ones who expect a high end budget on everything and expect Oscar winning actors.The only thing I struggled with was understanding who was who in regard to the bad guys in the White House as all the men sort of looked the same and they only ever used surnames to identify them.All in all, it's a good watch and you can binge watch the lot in a day. The story isn't bad either and it's easy to follow and it isn't too unpredictable either.",8
North America,"Ok, first off... Where did the writers go to school for their craft? If they didn't it shows, if they did, they should demand a refund.Secondly, regarding the protagonists, the assassins, I could give two flying ?? about them, especially the female one. She was borderline manic, psychotic, and 100% unlikable.The female Secret Service agent is 100% useless and fully unrealistic.The loopholes were big enough to fit the moon though, forget a mac truck. Support not existing, the secret service not doing background checks on people, and there is NEVER a time they are not around.Secret Service would not allow the VP's daughter out of their sight like they did. Whoever played the VP's daughter was way out if her depth. Nevermind every e else.I mean seriously, the rest of the characters are as two-dimensional as they come. They all could have died and the series could have been done with and I still wouldn't have cared.I honestly can't figure out how this got a continuation beyond the pilot... If you want a drinking game for every time you see something stupid happen, this isn't it. Because if you do, you'll die of alcohol poisoning.",3
North America,"Add more fight scenes pls, hope this show last at least 3 to 4 seasons or maybe more cause I love this show so much. I'm excited for the second season to be released. The story is so great it's not basic although plot twist is obvious in the middle of the episode but the details are great. I wonder what will the main character will become in the rest of the story. I hope his character becomes even better specially his skills as a knight agent. I have nothing mutch to say I just wish there was more fight scenes. I also want to see his back story more deeper. Overall great show that's why I put 9.",9
North America,"This had everything I have come to expect from a Netflix series.The core of the story, the basic conspiracy, is not bad, but it is so badly written. Especially the dialogue, which comes off as having been written by AI. The last few episodes in particular had me actually laughing due to the sheer preposterousness.Like the final episode where no one seems particularly concerned that all the comms are down at Camp David and our main characters are free to roam around, even letting one of them take the president as hostage at gunpoint, culminating in the female lead running around like a chicken with its head cut off with only one soldier lazily attempting to stop her. I don't know whether to blame the writing or the inept staging. But how was this made by the man who made The Shield??But the main culprit is the acting, which is horrible all around. Especially our wooden leads, who have the chemistry of a wet blanket. But the supporting cast are no better.And of course it had to be 10 episodes long, regardless of whether it has enough story or character development to fill ten hours or not, as per usual for a Netflix series.",3
North America,"Mediocre, at best.I like Gabriel Basso. He's the primary reason I chose to watch this. I liked him since I first saw him in Kings of Summer, and I thought he did a great job in Hillbilly Elegy. However, nothing about that bad script gives him, or any of the other actors for that matter, anything to work with. The plot twists are mostly predictable and the dialog is a heap of clichés stacked one on top of the other.The fact that this is about a government agent assigned to protect a female figure of national importance in a high stakes political thriller, but mostly the beginning with him stopping a terrorist attack on a train draws an immediate comparison to the acclaimed BBC show Bodyguard. However, The Night Agent pales in comparison to its British origin in every aspect. The story is less interesting, the characters and their motivation not as convincing and over-exaggerated at the same time, and their relationships weaker. And it's also missing Richard Madden's Scottish accent, but that's a terrible loss that every other show has to deal with, so you can't blame them too much for that.",4
North America,"This is more of a 90s vibe thriller in series form. Lots of action, chase scenes, non stop plot twists and turns. Yes maybe like some viewers commented, you need to suspend disbelief at times, but who cares?? It was so entertaining!!! I have missed this kind of action thriller, as they are not made like this these days. The ones out there are harder in terms of action and gore and so implausible that they just make me laugh. Yes the body count may be high here but it isn't overly graphic or gory. It was extremely entertaining. Also the main characters were likable and relatable and definitely not stupid. The acting overall was great!! I hope there will be a season two of this show ????",9
North America,"With the abundance of Netflix shows these days, went into this with low expectations and to just take the show as it comes. If you do that and just enjoy the storyline and twist, you will enjoy this show!It gives similar entertainment to 24 with the developing plot lines and unrealistic speed of the plot developing but you just have to enjoy it and not try to think it's realistic.The acting was solid all around and they did well to make you guessing the whole time. The twists and flashbacks made it entertaining.I'm hoping more people will watch this and appreciate this as they need to make more shows like this nowadays.",9
North America,"This is bad. It is like if you took one of the worse seasons of 24 and god rid of Keifer Sutherland as Jack badass Bauer and also took out all of the cool action. The boss is an asian lady. Ooh how progressive, I'm so impressed. It is just your typical modern Netflix garbage where the characters and story are generic and predictable because they care more about political correctness and propaganda. I can't think of much more to say because I only saw one episode but that's all I needed to see. I really just wanted to make my hilarious pun on the title. The main character is boring too. He is just so dull he should be called Jack Bore because he's a Bore. Another hilarious pun, I just can't help myself. This show sucks.",1
North America,"Very predictable love story, but certainly not reality. A young woman just takes over an FBI case with no training, no restrictions, or enforcement from above? Hard to believe. The side love story is totally predictable too. It seems that the tables have switched - now the male characters are the weak ones, which I always thought was true anyway (being a woman). Maybe I'm too old and cynical, but this does not deserve the viewership it is getting. I have watched several episodes because my husband likes the girl, but he is normally the type to prefer real spy shows, and now even he has to admit it is disappointing. People must be hungry for escapism.",4
North America,"I only managed half of the opening episode but in that time there had been a train bombing, several fight scenes, a home invasion and a car chase so this is definitely an all action show. Unfortunately there isn't much of a plot to stitch the action together nor are there realistic or appealing characters. Particularly anoying is Rose who is the definition of the damsel in distress who absolutely can not do as she is instructed even though her life depends on it. There's probably a plot involving corruption in high office but with the emphasis on high paced action it's difficult to see the wood for the trees.",1
North America,"The Night Agent is a Netflix series based on a cloak and dagger spy conspiracy story about an FBI agent played by Gabriel Basso who foils an attack in Washington DC. He is assigned to monitor the calls of a phone line that hardly ever rings till he gets a frantic call from Rose Larkin played by Luciano Buchanan. The storyline dives deep into the plot with a few twists that lead up to the Oval Office. It was full of action, bad acting, and full of cliches. Robert Patrick acts as a top level agent who throws Peter under the bus. D. B. Woodside played an FBI agent who covers the VP's daughter while Hong Chau acts as the Presidents Chief of Staff who has her own agenda. Hong has been steady growing in popularity and acting in mainstream media. The series was intriguing in the beginning but dwelled off course. Alan Arkin directed a few of the episodes and Kari Matchett played Madame President. If the story continues, I hope they come up with better acting.",7
North America,"Have seen too many of these Whitehouse themed conspiracy series' and movies, but this was full of action, way too much violence for me but some others may like that kind of thing. I did like the male lead Gabriel Basso who fit the FBI role perfectly and of course he was handsome - since there was a little romance involved that was necessary casting - good looking, smart, capable and he did portray all that. I have seen better scripting recently with short series - Beef for example that kept your attention every single episode and made you want to binge watch but this one not so much. Enjoyed finishing it but it wasn't like I wanted to binge watch it.",8
North America,"The story was gripping enough for me to binge it and see it through, but it certainly takes a massively large willing suspension of disbelief to allow it all to happen. If this were an anywhere near accurate reflection of our federal security and law enforcement services, we would be in deep trouble. The performances were decent but the actors were not given a whole lot to work with dialogue-wise. However, despite its predictability, the story keeps moving and keeps your attention until the end. It is a nice way to blow a couple of afternoons when you want rock-em-sock-em mindless entertainment.",5
North America,"I watched the Netflix series and struggled to finish it. There were so many bad actors, inconsistencies and questions but, like I said, I finished it. Decided to read the book and there's no comparison! There are some basic similarities to the TV series but the book is so much better and more plausible! Why do directors/screenwriters change the characters, plot lines, dialogue, etc. From a book that is so well written? The actors who played Sutherland, Diane Farr, Sutherland's godfather, were TERRIBLE, just to name a few. Characters were altered to the point that they are unrecognizable. The twists and turns in the book were so well laid out and plausible, but were embellished/altered for TV to the point that it was ruined. Changing the killers completely changes the story, especially the way it was decided to have a couple as hit men, why? Didn't improve it in any way. Just stupid.",2
North America,"From the moment you started watching the show, it was clear that something wasn't quite right. It was difficult to engage with the story or the characters, as both felt artificial and unconvincing.The show's cast also failed to impress, delivering performances that lacked depth and emotion. The actors struggled to make their characters believable, and it was clear that they were working with weak material. As a result, the show lacked the chemistry and rapport necessary to create a compelling and engaging viewing experience.Overall, it's difficult to recommend this TV show to anyone. While everyone's taste in TV shows is different, this particular show failed to deliver on any level. The writing was weak, the acting was lackluster, and the overall premise was absurd, making it hard to invest in the story or the characters. If you're looking for quality TV shows, it's best to avoid this one and look for better options.",1
North America,"This is a straight up ""non political commentary"" & ""conspiracy mystery"" but it's definitely not entertainment.Every ""actor"" sounds like they are just reading lines with no effort to pull off acting. You get the sense that they're just there for the check.1. In episode 8 the opening Flashback makes no sense at all. Why the POTUS chief of staff would be on board with the cover up? She had no knowledge of the attempted Metro bombing or what it's goal was. Attempting to cover it up made it more ridiculous and stupid and ran contrary to her trying to save the administration. In reality they would immediately throw the Vice President under the bus with his super donor if there was any hope to salvage the remainder of her term.2. By episode 3 you know that at some point (episode 6) it's predictable that they'd make the Protagonist into the Patsy, and that he was being manipulated pathetically by the chief of staff.3. The fact that the protagonist would have a romantic development with his witness was more like Patty Hurst syndrome but obvious from the moment she called the ""Night Agent"".4. The psychotic female assassin, was the only actor acting.5. ""24""'s legendary President Palmers younger brother, later to be a second President Palmer, later to be God's angel ""son"" in ""Lucifer"" (smart drop by Fox) must be hard up for work to take on the role of a flat washed up Secret Service agent. Or as a character to teach people under 35 that they're immature and could learn from the ""old school""6. After episode 8 and the kidnapping rescue it makes absolutely no sense that the Protagonist would still be trying to prove his set up beyond a reasonable doubt.8. The fact that another attack would be planned on US soil after the Moronic logic behind the first wasn't conceivable. The Veep hiding in a bunker so the ""terrorist"" can be blown up with POTUS. Would be difficult to explain had the plan worked.9. The veeps daughter is too old & has no political ambition to care about her father going to super max to not expose it and drag the audience through 3 more tedious episodes. The nanny cam just showed he was a jerk as a father not something damning like sexual or physical abuse.10. Basically a totally implausible conspiracy story, humorless , horrid acting. To make it worth watching or even continue to watch after episode 4 unless you're bored, totally stoned & alone.The PC police turned ""Woke"" have simply made it difficult to put out anything sexual that's not interracial couples, or homosexual. Action is mostly female centric, overkill, (ergo the box office success of Jon Wick 4), and it's very difficult to make anything remotely comical.",3
North America,"I agree that the first two episodes of Night Agent are fast pace and drew me in quickly. It had the feel of a good movie with the thought of espionage and dealing with national security... But I was disappointed once again in Netflix producing another film with poor language. The F word is in every scene and takes away from the plot. It makes the actors unbelievable in being learned public servants who work for our national government. I changed my rating from a 9 to 3 as I became sicked by writers, not knowing how to convey intense portions of the movie. Even if there is a second season, there may not be one for me. Come on Netflix - - do better. Lastly, I would have to say the leading actors are very solid, and the special effects were believable.",3
North America,"Just finished the series, definitely a fun watch. The start was pretty flat in the sense that its very conventional, standard spy-thriller-ish. I wouldn't say the first episode would hook you. But the mid series twist did for me. The puzzle complicates, things are not as one dimensional as they seem. I like the focus on showing the perspective of the assassin/s. We see their face, we see them go about their lives, a touch of humanity behind those murderous hands. They're also people with beliefs, dreams etc. I like the involvement of the Secret Service bit as you'll see later. Camaradarie, loyalty, rebellion. The last episode went too Michael-Bay. Explosions for the sake of explosions. Didn't like it that much. The main antagonist's switch in motive was too drastic, didn't make sense, didn't tie into anything. He wanted to repent of sorts, then suddenly go all out with his scheme. The show completely failed to make that connection. This is after all adapted from a book if I'm not wrong. These two were the major downsides, but overall, stumbled upon this series as a break from watching something else, and I liked it still. 7/10, nice as something to pass the time.",7
North America,"It's been a long time since I enjoyed a show this much. Usually if I'm watching tv I'm multi-tasking. Not so with this show. It kept my attention the entire way through and I binged almost all of the episodes in one evening. I was surprised by a couple of the twists. I like that they did t end it in the predictable way. Peter's Father really did what he was accused of and Peter and Rose didn't end up together, even though you want them to. The actress playing the female assassin did such a fantastic job playing a character who was pretty unhinged but then also oddly interested in having a house and raising g a baby (even if she did want to steal one from someone else). I'm looking forward to a second season but I wish we would see Peter Sutherland again.",9
North America,"I watched all S1 episodes and, oh, dear me!Such a poorly written script would have been ""fine"" in the 90's or early 2000's (maybe) but certainly not at this time and age.Either predictable or as-is events..
to name a few:
1. The male protagonist's best friend (a nice and jolly fellow) is asked to protect the female protagonist from killers. Guess who gets killed?2. The male protagonist is with the female protagonist on a private boat in the middle on nowhere, hmmm..I wonder what will FINALLY happen next?3. The captive punches a wall (why?) that causes a hole and in that exact spot she finds a very important serial number in which she will later encode and hide in a signal/speech combo riddle inside a video message and eventually lead the rescuers to her location. Who wrote this particular part? I want their name, now!P. S Am I the only who couldn't take the Chief of Staff actress seriously? Especially when she kept cursing and repeating the clusterf@#& word?",1
North America,"The Night Agent is proof that a series does not have to be great to be highly entertaining. I was forced to give it an 8, but at best it's a 7.5. It requires the viewer to suspend disbelief during its numerous plot twists: Agents who abandon their protectee no questions asked, gun battles at swanky hotels with nary a policeman or hotel patron in sight, universities that allow folks to simply stroll into the library with no ID required, etc. But once you overlook these things, it's entertaining, it's suspenseful, it's well acted, and the characters are quite compelling.The producers of The Night Agent have learned one important lesson: The more ethnically diverse your show is, the bigger and broader your audience is going to be. Accordingly, the lead female, Luciane Buchanan is a New Zealander of Tongan and Scottish descent; the female Secret Service agent Fola Evans-Akingbola, is a Brit of English and Nigerian parents; and the female Chief of Staff, Oscar nominated Hong Chau, is Vietnamese, but spent time in a refugee camp in Thailand growing up. While her character's constant stream of F-bombs has offended some people, I confess I got a kick out of it. All in all, The Night Agent is old-fashioned escapism. Leave your critical faculties at the door, and just enjoy the ride.",8
North America,"Gabriel Basso is a strong lead in an extremely weak acting ensemble. The writing is simply lacklustre with no memorable lines that shows like Peaky Blinders and Bodyguard serve up to their audiences on a consistent basis. In fact, several lines of dialogue seemed to be lifted directly from Bodyguard. Richard Madden and Sophie Rundle are a much better pairing in a much more believable relationship in Bodyguard than the main characters here. For the most part with the exception of Basso, the actors are bland and have little nuance. In addition, the writers, in order to stretch the series to a ridiculous 10 episodes, expects the audience to have an interest in 2 brutal murderers who have absolutely no redeeming features. Skip this and watch BODYGUARD on Netflix instead.",5
North America,"To be honest, The Night Agent is not as exotic as I expected but it is worth watching. The story is a little bit obvious but it is good enough to keep me watching with the twists and turns. Despite some weak points, it all comes together beautifully with the plot. The actor playing Peter Sutherland, the FBI agent is a solid and totally believable character. But in my opinion, the expression of the actress playing the role of Rose is remote and unemotional. Her facial expression is just the same in any situation. However, I like the chemistry between characters, especially the couple of murderers and all the actors are good enough to suit their characters. Overall, this series is a must-watch for anyone who loves a good action, thriller series and it isn't too complicated so you can follow it easily.",7
North America,"Fun if you just go with the flow and don't think about it too much. Do not compare to the Bodyguard, that show was much better quality.Cliched and predictable. You just know that as soon as a character starts talking about his estranged daughter that he's going to take camping, that this character is going to die before the end of the episode. Check!Poor acting almost all round. The actress playing Rose doesn't change facial expressions during the whole 10 episodes. Scared, angry, about to kiss Peter, every expression is the same. There is zero chemistry between the leads.Cringey dialogue. 'My aunt taught me origami in this room'. Seriously!!Ridiculously poor decisions made by characters just to move the plot along. Makes the secret service out to be imbeciles.People just able to break out of the White House or into Camp David with no problem at all. I mean honestly, breaking into Camp David in the boot of a car! It was laughable.Rose breaks a glass door to reach in and unlock the door to get into the house. Then she locks the door behind her. Why??!! The glass is broken, anyone can just reach and unlock itthen she stares out the window and keeps staring even though the assassin is right there. She keeps staring until she's sure he's seen herPeter constantly yelling at people about his innocent father. BoringWhy was the VPs daughter still bleeding right through her bandages and trousers? Enough to get a heap of blood smeared on the bannister? Made no senseeven the premise of a single agent sitting in a room waiting for the phone to ring. Who answers if he's on the loo or having a meal break lol. I mean, it's an 8 hour shift!",5
North America,"Yeah OK it is what it is - but - even allowing for yet another government conspiracy spy action show this one is beyond silly. 99% of their problems could all have been solved with a haircut and a $4.99 bottle of hair dye! No instead let an FBI agent and a supposed computer ""genius"" run around while on the most wanted list without even pulling up their hoodie. And I love it when people are totally alone and free to kill, car chase and fight within a mile of downtown Washington DC. Like there is ever a moment when someone else isn't nearby in a city. Sorry I hate this show and its characters too.",2
North America,"I had many spectations about this serie... many of them are now in the trashcan.I know many people have left their hearts and souls working here, but it has tow big ballasts to succeed such as a good production: the director and the writer. Why?Let's start with all those unbelievable and unrealistic details in national security they represent in the screen. Yes, I know that without them the serie could end in one chapter. Well... That would be better.What a weist of time waiting for the (happy) end, for discovering the author(s) of the conspiracy... It's a cliche after another.Also, the cast have sirious problems because they have to do whatever the director and the writer say. So, into the story some characters change one day to other without logic.I've never been in the FBI, but I'm sure they have now the serie in the introduction course to show to the rookie ones all they have never must do.In summary... Sorry! Finger down.",5
North America,"The plot itself is what drew me to watch this show. I love a good conspiracy thriller. It seemed as though it would be the perfect pick to binge on a lazy Sunday with a big bowl of popcorn.The opening really draws you in. I immediately thought, ""This show is going to be awesome!"" But then, halfway through episode 1, I began to realize how badly it was written.98% of the dialogue is wretchedly juvenile and cringey. The writers tried way too hard to try to make the characters' conversations hip and current and it simply did not work (at all!) and it showed on the actors' faces. There were plenty of moments when I was literally LOL'ing because the dialogue was beyond stupid and it was laughably ""painful"" to watch the actors saying that stuff. I can't fault the actors here. Bad writing is bad writing, and they had no choice but to work with what they were given.Sarah Desjardin's (Maddie Redfield) acting was awful to watch. I found myself rooting for her character to die because it was so bad. Gabriel Basso (Peter Sutherland), Luciane Buchanan (Rose Larkin), and Fola Evans-Akingbola (Chelsea Arrington) also had several brief instances of bad acting, and for these times it wasn't the dialogue's fault. Eve Harlow (Ellen), D. B. Woodside (Erik Monks), and Hong Chau (Diane Farr) stole the spotlight, in my opinion, as far as bringing their characters to life and delivering solid performances.The sets were on point. I feel like those were nailed perfectly. Most of the fight scenes were pretty good, but some had minor flaws that were easily overlooked.It's a good binge as long as you don't expect too much out of it (i.e. The dialogue). It kept me entertained for what it is and I looked forward to what was going to happen next at the end of each episode. I mainly gave it only 4 stars because of the dialogue.",4
North America,"I got sucked in watching the first 5 episodes but unfortunately, the show degenerated after that. The two leads Peter and Rose are very likable and smart. They seem to do everything reasonable to stay alive and manage to be one step ahead of the thugs. Where it gets dicey are the supporting actors who are very one note and/or cliched. Actress Hong Chau who plays Peter's handler is miscast with a limited acting range. Eve Harlow as one of the hitmen is HORRIBLE. She overacts in every scene and is not at all believable. Fortunately, the reliable DB Woodside anchors the show with his straightforward performance. As does actress. Fola Evans-Akingbola as his co-worker. That's the problem...the performances are uneven and there are various plot holes and face plant moments. My biggest pet peeve is when a protagonist is being pursued by police as ""most wanted""...they walk around in public without hiding their appearance. HELLO...there is a bolo splashed in all the news and you walk around in big public areas without disguising yourself?",7
North America,"The movie is so well written that there is no point you feel bored. Main characters have done justice to the story. The ending too was well narrated and suspense was good. It is highly unlikely that second season can be written as the first season closes all the loopholes and questions, unlike other series these days. Action is limited and do justice to the story line. The events were logical and suspense had good background story to believe. Overall its worth a binge watch for some mind games. I loved the leading lady who acted so calm and balanced under all situation. Love story that evolves is also doing justice.",9
North America,"I have to be honest and say I did not make it through all of Episode #1. But already .... I knew.Maybe you think this unfair of me, and it could be you're right. If so, Enjoy the watch.To kick-off the series, our young FBI hero boards a Washington DC subway train. Matt Damon-like, he is square of jaw but with twinkle in eye. This noticed by a little girl with whom he kids around .... but suddenly. A man in a black hoodie slips a daypack under a subway seat and departs the train. Our hero, his thoughts coming fast as running mud, figures out the 'What's Up', and as though moving through heavy water or Jello, he slowly makes his way to the pack, opens it, sees the bomb and pulls the Emergency Brake (yes, The Emergency Brake). The passengers somehow pry open the doors and screaming, enter into an active third-rail tunnel that looks as though it were badly constructed on a studio set, and .......Next, a young businesswoman has declared bankruptcy, and has come to live with her aunt and uncle. When the aunt and uncle are being murdered downstairs, the young woman calls a phone # she was given and gets 'The Night (FBI) Agent', our Damon-like friend from the subway. Over the phone, without knowing anything about her, he devises an escape plan for her down the house's lattice-work, into the neighbor's now-vacant house, into their closet ..... All this on the phone. And no, not a ZOOM call, no video, voice-only.And about the young woman he saves, she's unintentionally unappealing .....So. About thirty to forty minutes.But already, I knew.",1
North America,"The Night Agent was so damn stupid, however I was entertained.Firstly, the storyline had a decent premise, but the execution was ridiculous. So many plot holes and absolutely unbelievable scenarios. It became somewhat laughable. I mean, really the leads just survived almost being murdered for the millionth time and are still being hunted, but they are ready to go to pound town.Secondly, the acting. Wow, it's atrocious! The lead actor wasn't horrible, but everyone else was monotone and stiff. Truly the actors didn't have much to work with, so I understand why they're so robotic saying their lines.Even with the unrealistic storyline and underwhelming performances, it was still an entertaining binge.",4
North America,"No spoilers in this review don't worry!Honestly can't recommend you giving The Night Agent a try. I can't imagine anyone who would feel the need to give up on it. You won't regret watching this. Action packed, twists and turns, brilliant character development. All round outstanding.And even better, they've confirmed a second season is on the way.Been looking at the producer so I can watch other programmes with such umph, however this really is top quality so it will be a push.The most difficult part of this review is the number of required characters - if I could have written less I'd simply have said ""Watch it, you won't regret it.""",10
North America,"I thought the show was quite entertaining at first and well written. Acting was above average for a series from Netflix with an exception of only one or two characters. Around episode 8, I felt the writing got a bit lazy/sloppy and ended pretty melodramatic.Only found a couple of times where scenes felt out of place or unnecessary. Sometimes it did interrupt the flow of the story and action. Also, I would have given more background on some characters - they would act and react oddly but would have benefited from knowing more about their thinking and their past to justify it all.Give it 7/10 for action and storyline.",7
North America,"As many other reviewers have said, this is a competent enough drama and highly watchable. But you have to work hard at times to ignore the totally implausible plot.The story galloped along nicely for the 10 episodes and I binged the final 3 in a couple of days. But I was rather relieved when nothing at the end suggested a strong possibility of another series to follow. If there was another series, I would only watch it if the early reviews indicate an improvement in the writing.The acting of the lead characters was fine, and they coped well with the limitation of the script.Can't say I'd give it a strong recommendation but it's better than some other Netflix offerings.",7
North America,"If you looking for a fast action thriller. Find something else. Poorly cast, poorly acted, and just not convincing for me as a thriller.It's all just so predictable, I guessed two of the characters involved in the plot by episode 2, I wasn't wrong.Story is weak, acting is weaker and some of the fight scenes are about as believable a televised wrestling match.Maybe I missed the point, maybe it was meant to be a comedy. Though I didn't find it funny either. Just Very disappointing and very boring.For this to currently have a 7.6 rating on here I find strange. As normally the ratings are spot on.",3
North America,"The show is simply not believable. It started off with a great premise. But after about 30 minutes, I knew exactly where this was going. It is a stereotypical cop./bad guy show that doesn't fail to miss every single worn out cliche in the books. The simple fact that a victim, who has absolutely no law enforcement experience whatsoever, is even remotely allowed to be intimately involved in trying to solve the case, chase bad guys, etc., is so laughable, that it borders on a caricature of itself. Here is a woman that was victimized, no doubt, and is now, in essence, working as an FBI agent, sans the firearm. The Chief of Staff role is so one dimensional and flat, she too borders on a comic book character. Bad writing. Bad acting. Ridiculous storylines. One more thing, you know she and the FBI agent will eventually hook up. You can see that from episode one. As I said, predictable.",5
North America,Myself and my husband binged watched this series while on holiday. We both loved it. The two leads are amazing and go so well together. The rest of the cast are really good too so great casting. Especially the two assassins. Spent some time shouting at the TV. It reminded me of the film The Bourne Identity. There are a couple of small plot holes but I think the rest of it makes up for it. It's fast paced and full of excitement and action. So pleased to read there might be a second season.For me I would have liked better music to go with it.I can't believe the really bad reviews. It seems like so many other shows it has lovers and haters.,8
North America,"Please read this...I rarely ever write reviews unless I truly want to warn people (or excite people) about what they're about to spend their time on.I am utterly shocked at the number of positive reviews here, and ungarnered praise for a show that is shot so poorly, a script that is beyond amateur and a class of actors (with the exception of a few) that are so awful, they're a D grade at best.The creators try desperately to create a show like Homeland, 24, etc, but the script is so ridiculous and the cinematography is so bad, it's like watching a soap opera.The story itself could have been the backbones of a very good show had it been written, acted, and directed by a completely different group of people.The main actress (Lucianne) is INSUFFERABLE. She is NOT a real actress. She has ONE face for every emotion, a perpetual exaggerated ""shocked"" face with her eyebrows so high up and her eyes bulging out of her head to the point that it's completely distracting.Also, the idea that a Chief of Staff would EVER be in charge of a secret government intelligence operation is ABSURD.If you have any taste in TV and/or cinema this show is not worth your time. It's garbage.",1
North America,"Well, the story has major flaws not the least being it is totally unbelievable.And totally predictable. Spoiler alert: Girl calls boy. Boy saves girl. Boy helps girl. Girl helps boy. They hook up. You could see that coming from episode one.The bad guys are revealed about the halfway point in the series. But you can figure them out midway through the second episode.Too much gratuitous bad language, f words in particular.Kudos to Evans-Akingbola as Agent Arrington. And kudos to the 24 alumni D. B. Woodside (Agent Monks) and Kari Matchett (President Travers).On the other hand, there is plenty of intrigue and suspense and action along the way.",6
North America,"The action is decent. The acting is mediocre at best. The first three episodes were somewhat entertaining. Straight downhill after that. It just gets more convoluted from there. I know that it is television. However, couldn't they at least try to make it plausible? I started out optimistic because one of my favorite authors gave a good review. Now I am questioning his judgment. At the end, I felt like I had wasted over twelve hours of my life that I will never get back. I held out all the way to the end. I will not be looking forward to another season of this show. Disappointing product of an overly ambitious director/producer.",2
North America,"This is a very ""Jack Reacher"" kind of story, just from inside the White House.It all starts small, but everything leaves a small trace.. and when you start digging deeper and deeper, things only get uglier and out of hand. It's quite a weight-y plot! With good lines, good pacing, decent action, very good actors, and (more importantly) an intricate and believable enough story to make it an enjoyable binge watch. Revelations and execution are quite satisfying.. though sadly, I'm sorry to think that the prospect of a second season might have affected the ending of this one (on a personal level).Still, it is a complete story and would easily recommend it to one that likes the genre and has space to fill.",7
North America,"WRITTEN AFTER EPISODE 5 - Here is a series worth watching. The script is wonderful with all kinds of twists and turns, and some seemingly irrelevant stuff that isn't irrelevant after all. It's great that so many of the actors are relatively unknown so that you don't know if they are going to live or die. Performances are uniformly great with the exception of the President and Chief of Staff who don't live up to the high bar set by the others. It's the minor characters who are there for only a scene or two who really shine in this series.The photograph and the music are not up to the power of the script, so that's another reason why it gets a 9 instead of a 10.WRITTEN AFTER EPISODE 10. I dropped the rating from 9 to 8. Even thought about lower but didn't. Starting in Episode 7 there are continuity errors. One minor error is the hole in the wall which is supposedly hidden but then appears in one scene when it should still be hidden. This is minor and forgettable if there were not major continuity errors in later episodes. I don't want to reveal these lest I reveal what happens, so take my word for it and you probably won't notice anyway.",8
North America,"The plot, the dialogues, the characters are all extremely cringy. It's like a teenager wrote the script. There are too many plot holes that doesn't make any sense. The villains somehow always know who Rose and Peter talked to and their locations, and it's never properly explained how they got those information. The villains, especially character of the two assassins chasing after Rose and Peter are portrayed as stereotypical Disney villains, which is SO CRINGY. The lengthy romantic love story between them and how they want babies is unnecessary and cringy. The acting is also extremely cringy. Waste of time.",1
North America,Kind of crazy when you think one phone call to some guy sitting in a basement cause all the chaos that it did I like this series from episode 1 and then when he meets the girl that changes his life it's a pretty good roller coaster of a series it's crazy to think I'll cutthroat Washington politics really is there's a lot of people that you don't think will double cross you but you turn your back for one second and that's all she wrote A lot of good twists a lot of good turns some people that were dirty I wasn't expecting it so they had me guessing which was cool Hope they make a second series of this.,8
North America,Spoiler alert.I'll summarise the quality of the show in the following example.In the last episode Camp David is described as a 'fortress'Cue scene where two protagonists get inside via the boot of a car.Cue following scene where door to 'communications centre' is unlocked with a bad guy insideCue scene where the President of the USA wanders along a path to a meeting in high heels with maybe two security guards around.This is just one of many examples where the script writers were not intelligent enough to come up with a plausible approach and sidelined any potential reality thus rendering the series as a sort of comedy attempt at a Jack Reacher clone.,5
North America,"I thought that the overall plot was very good and refreshing as it kept us engaged from episode one through the last one. It was like watching a Bourne series on TV but without the super agent that Bourne was made to be. The characters were adequately developed, although a bit hurried esp for the female lead.The cringe part for us was that the ROMANTIC chemistry of the two leads just was NOT there... like, WHY? It feels so FORCED, at least as a romantic couple. They would have been better off kept as friends, like they were from the first several episodes. Hollywood-stereotype pressure? Also, although a fitting expert hacker, i guess, the lead female is almost notoriously and annoyingly a ""Nancy"" ... always snapping, always complaining almost all the time even when it's not called for? Dunno if directing or acting criticism.",7
North America,"Think ""24"", ""Bourne"" series, ""Designated Survivor"", this show adds to a string of conpiracy/spy thrillers, most of which were much better.It's not really bad, but not exactly great either, although the first 3 episodes did look promising.It does have quite a lot of action, (car chases and the usual shootouts where nobody seems to hit anybody), even a few explosions, so that part is covered pretty well.The plot however, is definitely where it falls short, and the added twists (and there's quite a few of them), doesn't really help. Several of those twists can be seen coming from miles away.The acting, like the rest of the mess, is mostly average, and although it seems to be cleared for another season, I doubt that I'll be wasting my time on it.",5
North America,"I went into this thinking I'd be bored out of my mind and that I wouldn't enjoy watching another action thriller about government espionage, and while the plot isn't necessarily original, the performances and set up kept me hooked the entire time. Rarely does a show keep me paying attention for more than 80% of it but I have to admit, The Night Agent had me on the edge of my seat multiple times throughout the season. I can't quite put my finger on what's so special about the show, but there's something magical there. Spy thrillers aren't typically my cup of tea, but this show has quickly made as one my favorites and I'm excited to see what else is in store. Fingers crossed they continue in the direction their going thus far.",8
North America,A dystopian reality with a female president. Possibly her machinations have formed this reality requiring spunky and good looking agents.Oh how I long for the days of fat arse lead actors! Wtf 600 words.I had a puppy once and he was nice but he never toilet trained properly so I had to leave him in a dumpster for YouTube people to find!Never have I been so sad except when I threw some kittens in a bag for my girlfriend and she threw up because she is allergic.You know that movie with that rockstar fella? You know the first one that's a classic but the others you know are good but can never beat the first one!,5
North America,Let me be honest most of the TV shows don't get excited from the first episode itself but this was different. The first episode itself had marked up that this show will be going to be a high stake and quite dangerous and thrilling story line. Especially the acting in this TV show was spot on by every character it was so Amazon that by the time you will trust a person by the next episode he will be your number 1 suspect yes indeed their are many betrayals In this TV show which can be annoying to some people but for this type of plot of thriller and suspense it is pretty dang good especially much recommended is the last episode is the best in class. There might be a few plot holes in first for the viewers but they will eventually get clear.,10
North America,"I gave it 7 but at the end I think 6 was more than enough. The act was horrible, that gilt Rose ... she wasn't even look like she lost her family at one night , no sadness or shock appeared in his face. Sometimes she was acting and talking like it's a comic ?!? The plots were poor , unconvincing performance or stupid scenes. I have a feeling they wanted to make a copy of Night Manager sort of ?!?I gave it 7 but at the end I think 6 was more than enough.

North America,"This is a mostly entertaining action flick, with an on and off again engaging plot marred by excessive f-bombs used to cover up poor writing.No joke, count on 20+ f-bombs in each episode.The main characters (Peter and Rose) are well played, but the supporting cast really struggles to be believable.There are also repeated suggestions (mostly overt but some direct) that support the world view that all white people are racist. If this doesn't align with your particular world view, you may not appreciate the injected dialog.There are definitely a plethora of suspenseful moments, but some are also quite mundane.If they removed the unnecessary profanity it could easily be more enjoyable.",5
North America,"Kinda ok web series, nothing great nothing bad about it. But its long, waayyyyyyyyy too long than it should've been. Each and every character has some back story and a lot of dialogues drama, its too much. 8 hours for the story they wanted to tell is not something I'm going to buy the next time. I think if they had wrapped each episode within 30-45 minutes rather than an hour, would worth it. I expected more action, more thrills and that's where I got disappointed.Watch it if you have absolutely nothing to do, keep your expectations very very low and you might not get disappointed or else you can give it a pass.",5
North America,"I'm usually very hard on writing reviews on IMDb for content I have watched, But not this time around . It's been a long time since I have enjoyed a series such as The night agent ,only minor gripe would be the overdone plot but even so it was well worth the watch.I thought all the actors were superbly cast and filled their rolls on this series with great drive and believability... kudos to all...
The production team ,camera crew, direction, writers ... And all the others I missed you made a fast paced rollicking great story for us all to watch... Quality viewing for a change, ... Netflix pay these guys more!!!",10
North America,"This is one of those cases where the writers think that people won't ask questions if they just put together scene after scene of people running, cars chasing, guns shooting, and people hyperventilating.The cast is terrible. No one knows how to act. Action sequences have zero logic. Kind of reminds me of that Russel Crowe movie Unhinged. Incredible things are happening in the middle of Washington DC.....but where are the cops? The plot holes are so big that Crowse can take his gigantic pick up truck and keep driving though them all day.Sometimes, you can turn off logic and enjoy a thrill ride. This unfortunately, is not such a show.",1
North America,"Undoubtedly one of the most entertaining shows I have seen in recent years.Maybe not a surprise since ""24"" is one of my all time favorite shows and this is very similar. The real time is not of course but plot wise it is.There are some complains about realism and of course but this is a show. It's meant to entertain. A lot of actions or whatever wouldn't take place IRL and that's probably true. But to me most of it works.One thing however.. and that is that the (second) assassination attempt on Omar Kadar and president Travers.It's possible that there have been a conspiracy we don't know about on this level IRL but for so many people inside the White House to be in on it and basically because of a disagreement.. I mean, that's far-fetched..However, to me the characters are generally good and at least to me they act with some logic to the story. If they don't, that's the most annoying lack of realism. To me.However, as I said, this is a great watch.9/10 and eager for season 2.",9
North America,"The Night Agent is a must-watch show for anyone who loves a good thriller. The plot is engaging and keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The characters are well-developed and the acting is superb. The production quality is top-notch and the cinematography is stunning. Overall, The Night Agent is a fantastic show that I highly recommend to anyone looking for a gripping and entertaining viewing experience. Is full of unexpected twists and turns. The acting is not really superb but the production value is top-notch. Overall, The Night Agent is a must-watch for anyone who enjoys a good mystery.",10
North America,"The series may appeal to those seeking a somewhat unrealistic premise - a beer-drinking age teenage actor from rural Alabama who takes on the role of a savvy intelligence agent.However, the lead actor bears a striking resemblance to Jason Bourne, and the plotline can be perceived as implausible and lacking in depth.Some may view the storyline as somewhat cheesy, and the overall premise feels dated in the modern era of entertainment.As viewers, we have evolved beyond the traditional tropes of FBI and CIA secret agent shows, and it is time for filmmakers to update their approach and offer new and engaging narratives that reflect the present day.",1
North America,"Despite the idea of having one more story where the US President is threatened and that high circles of the state are rotten (...), the story, the action and the characters are pretty likable.Not only the president is a woman but a lot of the main and decisive protagonists are too, sorry for the good old male domination...The main character and his trauma about the loss of his father when he was a teenager is well used to accompany the whole unfolding of the story, as much as the primary motivation of the chief of staff to take the direction that she (again..) took !And that made a pretty good series I must say.",9
North America,"No animals were harmed during the filming of this series, but many sharks were jumped. No spoilers here but this was both engrossing and completely silly. This was less frustrating than for example the Lincoln Lawyer (Netflix series not the movie) but it suffers from many of the same issues, a plot that makes no plausible sense, thinly construted characters, average to below average acting. Despite all that, it was fairly entertaining and you could do far worse than this. 421098765432109876543210987654321098765432109876543210987654321098765432109876543210987654321098765432109876543210987654321.",7
North America,"Not the best show out there but definitely not the worst either. Keeps you occupied and watching, if you are willing to ignore the scrambled acting and plot points.The acting from the actress playing Rose is a bit stiff but then evens out as the series progresses, and the main character is played quite well. There are a lot of clichés and is predictable at times, but the fast paced nature of this show let's one to be immune to that.Some of the footage is a bit jumpy and cuts off at weird moments, which has much more to do with the editing than the camerawork. All in all it is a decent watch and I'd recommend it for a weekend binge watch.",8
North America,"The UK's Bodyguard that aired in 2018 is so much better than this show. There is just no comparison.This show is really predictable and main character is not the best actor. Side note: He is obsessed with his father who was investigated by FBI and was found guilty by them. This guy or the night agent man (I am watching this right not and cannot for the life of me remember this guys/characters name. Anyway, he is a very bread and butter actor (IMHO). He makes speeches to other characters about his dad whenever he can--even at inappropriate times. I start laughing at him because he tries acting out all emotions at once: sad/angry/frustrated/unresolved questions/doomed for life if cannot figure out what happened to dad stuff.This series I will finish but I am on episode 5 and it is not getting better. It is not terrible terrible, but it is not very good either. Watchable for sure.",6
North America,This is a good series with a good concept for a successful series but the acting is very amateur hence why I only have this five stars. I don't think this series deserves higher than a six. It is a typical Netflix series and slightly predictable at times. You need to invest time into this to get past the bad acting as sometimes it's very cringy and difficult to watch. The lead character is ok at best but that's all I would put it. I think Netflix needs to put more time into it's series in order to make them good otherwise it won't get another season. I was surprised at how popular this was given the acting.,6
North America,"This show feels like 24 had a baby with any other of those ""1 man saves America"" cheesy movies.The acting is terrible, the dialogue is so predictable and one low key FBI agent with a tragic story saves America.The bad guys always teleport so quickly to the right place at the right moment (travelling through states like its nothing) and they seem to know exactly where to find the FBI agent, even in a huge university campus.Unoriginal plot twists, a lot of deja-vus and the incohorences in the story will give you headaches. It really feels like I'm watching a bad version of Jack Bauer going through the same corruption schemes of private corps funding political agendas.C'mon writers, get original ...",3
North America,I'm halfway into episode two and so far the characters' reactions and next actions are incredibly predictable. Rose becomes clingy within a day and calls Peter on the super secure line just because she can't sleep. Give me a break. The storyline seems very forced with characters' actions rushed to push a dull plot along.The concept of 'show don't tell' comes to mind as well.So far it's easy enough viewing where you don't have to pay too much attention to follow the story.It was great to see Eve Harlow as an antagonist after her sweet portrayal of Maya in The 100. She's a great actress with potential to become a big name in the industry.,6
North America,"Are you the kind of person who can suspend disbelief to such an extent that you think an FBI agent on the run and a computer tech could break into Camp David in the middle of a national crisis simply by hiding in the trunk of a car? If you are, this might be the show for you.This show is full of plot holes and implausability, the two leads have whatever the opposite of chemistry is, and the actin is wooden.Having said that, it is moderately entertaining, the plot twists keep coming (even if out of nowhere), there is plenty of action. Probably ok for fans of shows like ""Designated Survivor"" or ""The Shooter"" TV version.",3
North America,"Since most tv series are so bad these days, its hard to know what I would have rated this 6 or 7 years ago because so much competition was out there. But in this day and age, i rated it 8. I found a show that had a reasonably good plot line, fast past and fun to watch the twists and turns.I dont think ive ever seen Gabriel Basso but I thought he did a good job in this show and he's very cute! ;)How did Diane Farr get a job on this show? Her acting was horrible! I guess they had to have the quota for diversity but there are many other Asian actors that could have done this a thousand times better. Really disappointed in this decision.All and all, enjoyed the show.",8
North America,"Ok, it was a complicated plot with lots of subplots. The acting was good and action kept coming. BUT .. the lead is FBI. They are not bottom level fight/shooter trained. Most close three cases in 20 years. This guy is beating up Secret Service and trained assassins. By the end she is too! The computer geek becomes a fighter, even kills the lead assassin. Secret Service bad guys just slip next to the President with bombs. And the star beats up 50 guys in 10 episodes. Not gonna talk about the alphabet soup thrown in for no reason. And the evil twin. The funniest is at the end, him picking out the turned Secret Service agents out of a crowd! Hahaha, so ridiculous. It was good, just don't think too much.",7
North America,I thought this was a great show! It's a convoluted spy series that had me finding the traitor then changing my mind then going back again to my original theory which was correct but with more involved. Peter was the perfect newbie to the game with a heart and rose was his perfect sidekick. She was smart and fearless and trustworthy and I hope they keep her in the series because she is great with him. They had a good chemistry as well as the banter and sarcasm. I think they played well off each other. I'll miss Diane because despite her behavior I enjoyed her toughness. I will anxiously await season 2 in the hopes Netflix doesn't ditch another good series.,10
North America,"So yeah i finished season 1 and i need to say that i really enjoyed it. It have some classic things like the conspiracy, the president in danger, the personal conflict, the subplot andhsome revelations(Diane Farr, the real threat that the president is ). A nice season that have some cliché and some things already seen elsewhere but i really found the night agent interesting and tell us a story and let us discover the night agent institution with some conspiracy and stuff. I found the actions scenes well made and really give some tensions and made it escalate sometimes. That Night Agent Tv show was pleaseant to watch and i really spend a great time watching it and i will wait for season 2 for sure.",6
North America,"We binged watched the 10 episodes in just under a week.I have to have,we really enjoyed them.Some characters need could skip season 2 in my opinion, But Peter and Rose carried this on their backs. Two young upcoming stars in the making here.Hats off to Gabriel Basso and Luciane Buchanan they've started something here.It's not Jack Ryan but it's got potential,and with season 2 showing here on IMDB. It looks like they got a chance to further and expand the story.Well done folks.I'm looking forward to season 2.Will we get Europe-Asia-Middle east?Will we get more in depth info on the night agents?I hope so.",9
North America,The Story is clean cut and amazing fast paced .Never boring had difficulty switching off at 1am well but what really puzzel3d blame qas the behavior in the whole house l.Conspiracy and all but the setup was blunt and a blind person could see that's all a fake sobwas hard to finish either last few episodes.So when than everybody turned on him he falls in love mhhhhh.It's the violence and badness how people working in the secret service and how they been treated to obvious to be honest whoever watched 24 west wing etc always treated as criminals and they shoot on site every time.I found it to long the end could have been wrapped up by after the VP daughter has retunr after the spa the devil we know the last ep just a complete mushy and wierd.,10
North America,"Concept is fantastic, but lacks execution. Maybe they're the wrong actors for the part, or maybe it's simply a byproduct of average directing, but for a show with a decent budget is hard to connect to the characters.I tried to push through, thinking the first episode is a pilot and maybe later episodes were better, but it wasn't the case.Unnatural performances, lack of smooth scene flow, jarring inserts of commentary and lack of subtlety in imagery and juxtaposition do nothing for the tempo of the show.I've seen some of the actors in other roles and was impressed by them, so this was very much a let down undeserving of the budget.A remake is in order.",7
North America,"The actors who played Diane Farr and Rose Larkin have been played by bad actors, made worse by bad writing. Rose is a hacker with the same furrowed eyebrows and grim face in all her scenes. And she's a cliche hacker who can just tap a few buttons and get into any system. The actor who plays Diane Farr just doesn't feel the part for a Whitehouse honcho. Again flat face with a swear word thrown in every sentence to make herself sound bossy. Don't these people have families or things to do other than office work? The plot was far fetched, but would have led to a good payoff if they had invested time in the foreign leader and the POTUS. At the end, I just felt no empathy towards who lives and who dies. The only positive thing is that the protagonist seemed to a good actor.",7
North America,"The story is pretty good but the actors/acting is subpar at best. It feels like Hallmark movie cheesiness, as if this was their first attempt at the action genre. The majority of the actors were not believable in their characters. There is an instance where a character has a leg injury and has to walk all over the place but the producers did not think to give this injured character crutches, so they have to hobble around for the rest of the movie in a manner which was not believable and, even worse, laughable. Better actors would have made this a Jack Ryan series competitor. Instead, it falls well short.",5
North America,"""The Night Agent"" (S01, 10 eps, 45-min, Netflix) is an attempt at an FBI action thriller series but it's lacking a few key elements that warrant a middling rating rather than a high rating. This might be because there are 10, count 'em, 10 executive producers, so this is a tv show by committee and that may have been its core problem. The nut of the story is really good and it's got good production values, so this show had real potential, but it dropped the ball in its execution maybe because there are five directors (!) and eight writers (!), most with little/no experience. So once again, another new Netflix series is really just a gimpy training ground for rookies to get writing/directing credits at our entertainment expense and I am so tired of this being the 90% case - only 1 in 10 new Netflix shows are decent enough to watch to the end. Well I called time-of-death at episode three when it just got too stupid to endure further.",4
North America,"Flat and inspirationless story with loads of gaps and held together with spit and wire.The agent saying that he's trained in evasion and other secret agent stuff, but then parks his car nose first towards the cabin in the woods, while they need to be able to make a quick getaway?The secret service superiors explaining themselves why they pull someone from her post and why the replacement is worthy of the job?An air gapped system allows to install a WiFi dongle without admin rights?The hidden disk is found by touching the first stone in the entire house?It's a just a little too easy sometimes, and unconvincing.",5
North America,"A binge series on a rainy day when you at times let it run in the background while doing choirs. Zero character logic and childish character build, as if the writers have never met human beings. Some things are refreshingly unstale for an American production, though. I suppose this is all the next generation is able to build.Some of the dialogue is good, but most of the character build is based on some childish disney character book on what different characters look like. The main villain is obvious from the beginning and can be spotted by their physical appearance. Well, this is obvious to anyone who was born before 1995.",5
North America,I binged on it quite quickly and was impressed with the narrative and Man From UNCLE/James Bond elements. Special rookie agent Peter Sutherland goes under-cover for protection and follows his own code of ethics.The acting is solid. Gabriel Basso reminds me of Matt Damon in Jason Bourne. The White House decor is very nice and the attention-to-detail on US Government stuff is excellent. It's refreshing to see a recycled theme done properly and with purpose and conviction.The character-driven element means it's more about the narrative than overuse action all the time. I particularly enjoyed the character build-up then the twists were well-executed and the screenplay was top too.I'm a huge fan of D. B. Woodside and his acting is stunning. He nails the security / FBI guard. Looks like the security you get at airports. The keen eye and the no-nonsense stare.Luciane Buchanan and Fola Evans-Akingbola are rising stars. I must say I was surprised by not knowing the majority of the casting list yet it really did work. The casting team did a fabulous job. It's also nice having actors play their actual age instead of someone considerably younger.It's also believable that the two leading FBI stars are 27 and rookies in the FBI this would certainly make sense. It's nice when TV shows follow real-life ages instead of casting someone a decade older for a teen show!The direction was great. I loved the script. It felt very 'prime time'. I guess there's scope for a second season but we'll never know with streaming services these days. It's made for fans of Jack Ryan; Man From UNCLE; James Bond and Jason Bourne.I don't want to disclose too much but it's a must-watch show.Great stuff!,9
North America,"This series had a lot to like about it. The plot was formulaic yet enjoyable. The action sequences I felt were filmed well in particular the fight scenes. They had a real feeling to them. BUT the acting was what detracted the most here. All of the actors seemed like wooden soldiers. They expressed no emotion other than an occasional grimace. The worst offender was the actress that played the President's Chief of Staff, Diane Farr. Every scene she was in just sucked the energy out of it. There could have been a great action sequence that would have you believing this was one of the greatest shows since 24. Then.... She pops in and ruins any momentum. If there is a season 2 (and I hope there is) I pray they don't find some rationale to include her in it. Unless she's playing a marionette. That's about as good as her skill set can deliver.",8
North America,"First off, I binged this show, so despite my critique it's obviously good enough to keep someone hooked.That said, it baffles me a bit how this genre of series is never brought to the next level. There are a lot of them (24, Designated survivor, Nikita, Bodyguard, etc) and they almost always have the same problem: badly developed 'bad guys'. A well-written bad guy as an understandable motive and takes logical steps to achieve their goal. The bad guys in The Night Agent don't have a clear motive, which kind of pulled me out of the series by the end because it became so obvious they were just bad because the plot required them to be.The writing is a problem for much dialogue, too. There comes a point were the leads supposedly try to charm each other with 'humor', but they end up laughing akwardly hard at very mediocre jokes.I also wonder why the director never told the lead female to act less like every traumatic event happening around her is only a huge inconvenience to her that requires to other emotional response than to be bitchy, and why the director never told the lead male to stop shouting out state secrets in public (as he is supposed to be a trained FBI-agent)",6
North America,"The first three episodes are not too bad if you are just looking to unplug your brain.Episode 4 is starting to feel a little overstretched with unnecessary B plots and the bucket of paper thin characters recently dropped on the main story to turn the plot into an 8 episode show.By Episode 5, you won't be looking to unplug your brain, you'll need to be brain dead to enjoy yourself.The plot turns ludicrous; predictable twists abound and the show keeps borrowing here and there from other things in a way that seems less and less organic.Episode 6 is when the show just goes off the rails entirely... and there's 2 more episodes to go. WhewOverall, it's yet another example of what could have been a half decent thriller movie turned into a mediocre watered down 8 episodes show.",5
North America,"I see reviews saying all of the reasons that this show is a dumpster fire and then ""but it's action packed 8/10."" No. It's just trash. Fast paced trash. Like an actual flaming dumpster but on wheels with a rocket strapped to it. Just because it doesn't put you to sleep doesn't make it any less terrible. I kindly ask Netflix to stop shoving this terrible show down my throat every time I open the app. It's starting to feel abusive and I may call Ronan Farrow if it goes any further. The acting is abysmal, the writing is somehow worse, and the logical leaps require a Jordanesque vertical ability to make possible. I hate it.",1
North America,"The dialogue is terrible. I feel uncomfortable for the poor actors who had to read these lines. It is full of very cringy moments.So many eye rolling moments. People in these high positions would never act this way. Sure the real government officials are likely corrupt, but they would never do these silly things.Swearing thrown in awkwardly here and there.This is, unfortunately, a typical trashy Netflix show. I really wish they would do better.Overall it's a high production show with terrible dialogue. There is a huge disconnect between the quality of the visuals and the quality of the writing.",4
North America,"Just finished binge watching this new 10 episode series on Netflix. ""The Night Agent"" It's a very engrossing, never a dull moment, wild ride of a series. Each episode will make you want to see the next. Lots of twists and character elements that will make you want to pay rapt attention to the details.For me, the one message that rang loud and clear throughout, was this statement, pulled from my own Security Clearance Report that is repeated over and over: ""This information is not something that could be used against him as a source of blackmail or coercion"". This is the crux of Trust that must be maintained and constantly held in check for anyone entrusted with intelligence that is Classified.Highly recommended film. I'm probably going to watch it again in a few weeks, just to refollow the narrative, now that I know the full story. Doing that always results in a litany of things that you didn't notice when you watch something like this the first time through. Each episode is about 50 minutes.IMDB is showing a 2nd Season in the Listing, so I hope it's true and will likely be released in 2024. (An election year, which in itself is interesting)",10
North America,"This is another one of those shows that starts off strong but quickly degrades into unbelievable nonsense. Overall the acting is pretty solid (except for whoever plays Rose and Diane - holy cow are they terrible), the cinematography and direction is really good, but the writing so comically bad and unbelievable that they only way you could ever fight through the dumb is if you were on lots of drugs or severely intellectually challenged. Characters continually do totally unbelievable things that make no sense and by the time you get to the end the plot is so absurd it'll straight up make you angry. As someone else said, in todays world of awful shows this is better than most, but that still doesn't make it good.",4
North America,"I found the show to be mediocre at best since the writing was obviously done by people with limited life experience. Contrivances, convenient coincidences and plot devices make this difficult to watch. The dialogue is CW level and nowhere near as good as it is on shows like ""the diplomat"". I honestly wanted to like the show but the dialogue is simplistic and there is too much stuff that just would not happen in the real world. Why would the White House Chief of Staff Be running FBI ops and have an agent in the basement of the White House answering the phone? The show is almost watchable but not if you have recently watched a similar show that was much better.",5
North America,"First of all, it is filmed so darkly - literally dark colors - that it's very hard to see what's going on. Secondly, it's fairly predictable in the first two episodes maybe it gets better? But I lost interest squinting to see what was happening with my lighting turned all the way up.I was also not at all surprised at any point about where it was headed. The good looking square jawed guy is a big hero, rescuing the poor helpless woman. And someone getting chased or getting shot every five or 10 minutes. Somehow the surprises weren't at all surprising. I'm sure it appeals to young boys everywhere but if you're looking for grown up entertainment try The Diplomat instead.",5
North America,"GoodI liked this mainly okay with some good action sequences and fairly fast pacingBadI did find the female lead agitating, argumentative and plain jarring most of the times. Yes the plot had holes that a bus could drive through that in parts felt implausible, and characters also lacked development and I found many hard to warm to.SpoilerIt was not surprise as to the revelation of the Chief of Staff but again the character development was as such that I didn't care too much either way. Unsure if this was bad casting or scripting, potentially both.Overall not ground breaking but watchable all the same if you don't pay too much attention to detail, just don't expect a great deal and you won't be disappointed.",7
North America,"To hit the highlights, viewers will like the action. The plot moves quickly in some episodes with a cliff hangar that ends most episodes but, my gosh, the dialogue that hastily drives the plot-line is so contrived, predictable, cliche, and unbelievable that it is hard to watch without laughing. Suspension of disbelief is on notice here, but viewers can only disbelieve so much! With all of his experience, Adam Arkin is better than this script, and the screen writers that wrote this should take time to reflect on this bad writing! Come on! Writers are better than this effort! Netflix should start focusing on quality instead of quantity.",3
North America,"This entertaining pseudo-thriller starts of a bit silly and get's progressively more idiotic in storyline towards the end, all the while remaining very entertaining as the cardboard characters ""act"" towards the trope laden finale.Despite the silliness I stuck with it for the pure fun value as the who dunnit messy plot veered around. Still trying to figure out how much bigger the boat cabin was on the inside than the boat was on the outside.It will be interesting to see where they go with season two now that most of the interesting characters from season one won't be available it seems for various reasons.",7
North America,"Every single episode is watchable. I often take issue with Netflix series for dragging a story out over too many episode, but this is spot on. There is just the right level of 'are they a good guy or a bad guy', the lead actor is excellent, complemented by good acting all around. It sets itself up nicely to have another season too. It's fast paced and engaging, and it's interesting.The story isn't all given away early either, which is often the case. There are numerous sub plots that are well done. It is not over romanticised. The female lead is annoying, but it seems like this was the intention. It is corny at times, but this is one of the better offerings from Netflix for a while.",7
North America,"Nothing really wrong with the acting. Just a bad story, bad dialogue, bad characters, bad plot. It's all cut by numbers, derivative, been done before. The guy that stars in it, Gabriel Basso has no charisma. There is a line where he referred to being a hot shot basketball player...ya, whatever. Luciane Buchanan is earnest but what a bad character.... She was a super sleuth IT person who's company went bankrupt. Ya. That is real believable. Neither person is right for the fictional character they portray. There is a nice cast of diverse actors, almost each one of whom seems wrong for the part in question, each one playing a stock character. VP's daughter...bad. Spy BF...bad. Secret Service Agents guarding her....bad.If this was not written by AI, and cast by AI...then I recommend strongly you try putting AI in charge because this is just horrible.I do not recommend this lazy stupid contrived junk to anyone.",3
North America,"I was captivated by the thrilling plot of The Night Agent and found most of the characters to be enjoyable. Unfortunately, I was not a fan of some of the other characters. In my opinion, the show could have been more concise; the narrative could have been more succinct and some of the filler content could have been removed. The acting was quite good, and the special effects were decent, but I think the pacing of the story was a bit slow. Furthermore, I felt like the dialogue was a bit clunky at times and could have been improved. Nevertheless, the finale of the show managed to wrap up the plot points nicely, even though I think the series overall was overrated. The ending was satisfying, and I appreciate the effort put in to make the narrative engaging. Altogether, while I think the show could have been tighter, it was still enjoyable to watch and I would recommend it as a decent watch.",5
North America,"Great story, engaging and cerebral with loads of potential to become a regular series for Netflix. The character of the actual Night Agent was very likable, with a strong moral compass and desire to do the right thing in service to his country. You're rooting for him throughout the series. Unfortunately, the character of Diane Farr is sooooo distracting you almost want to fast forward through her scenes. Whether it's her actual dialogue or the actress was ""over-acting"", Farr came off as overly dramatic and ridiculous. She had zero credibility as the president's chief of staff and more like a political wannabe begging for legitimacy.",8
North America,"Diane Farr's acting is so bad it was painful to go through the whole show. The storyline with the two killers was exciting, they were good characters but their end was tasteless, without content or purpose, too bad ?? The end of the twin bomber didn't put more context or story either, there was potential there. It feels a bit bitter overall.Other than that it's a decent show, you wanna see how the story goes except you know a little bit too much 4 or 5 episodes before the end. It's a typical/good Netflix evening filler so I'll take that! Hopefully they don't push to a second season because I wouldn't watch more, 9 episodes of that was just fine.",6
North America,"Watching this was very similar to the tv series 24. Lots of plot twists and turns and never knowing who to trust. If not taken too seriously this show is entertaining. The chemistry between the main character, (Peter) and the female lead (Rose) was good. Rose wasn't just some damsel in distress with nothing to offer. She actually helped Peter and they made a good team. No instant love story common in the 80s where the damsel is saved and helpless and of course sleeps with the main male lead, at least not at first. When they do have that scene later they at least have chemistry but one does wonder when you're the most wanted man in America how is that something even considered. Diane Farr was a little vexing as a character, since the actress who played her didn't come across convincing enough of her character. Same goes for madam President who seems a little young to be president. There are plenty of plot twists, unfortunately the story takes a while to develop. Even over half way through all the episodes you still may be wondering what everyone's motive is. It comes together in the end and makes sense and perhaps that just adds to the intrigue. Like the show 24 there are some absurd moments. For example Peter fights an assassin and as they wrestle for the gun only 3 shots are fired and yet the gun is empty when Peter goes to shoot the assassin. Also when a hand gun is empty the slide kicks back, which didn't happen, basic firearm knowledge. Also why is Peter not wearing sunglasses and a hat when he's blamed for kidnapping the VP's daughter is pretty stupid. Guess some people don't like wearing hats even when they're America's most wanted which leads to a confrontation with Meal Team Six or some Proud Boys. The assassins' story gets stale pretty fast as they constantly kill people. The audience is not interested in psychopaths or sociopaths, so why the show focuses so much on them is a little perplexing. The ending is absurd like most action shows are these days but who doesn't want a happy ending? It ends well enough and hopefully sets up a second season. As mentioned earlier if not taken too seriously it's an entertaining show despite some odd moments.",7
North America,"Acting is simply horrible. With a few exceptions (Phoenix Raei, Eve Harlow, D. B. Woodside) everyone else is either horribly miscast or simply a very bad actor. The leads are unbelievable and simply laughable at times. The White House staff are ridiculously bad.On to the story, there are several holes in the story. I don't want to give too much away, but things happen for no logical reason. It seems like logic doesn't play a big part in the series. You can guess the main plot points after episode 3.All in all, the combination of horrible actors and mediocre storylines make this into a below average TV show.",5
North America,"This miniseries starts out okay, with an FBI agent working in the basement alone in a room waiting for a phone to ring ... but which never rings ... until episode 1 (not a spoiler).Of course, the FBI agent is good-looking ... and so is the person who calls him ... and of course they are essentially the same age ... and ultimately attracted to each other et cetera et cetera et cetera. Oh, and, of course, they are both very brave and skilled at physical and computer stuff.The Asian actress from the overrated ""The Whale"" (Colin Farrell got robbed of an Oscar for ""The Banshees of Inisherin"") is in this as the White House Chief of Staff and while she's got decent acting chops she drops F-bombs throughout this show as often as she breathes.The show gets pedestrian, predictable and formulaic quickly. It's also overlong. I had to force myself to finish the last two or three episodes.",5
North America,"Regretfully, I watched the entire series. It's hard to explain in a few sentences just how poorly it was all written, and the many technical errors from the show. One of the issues that was the greatest annoyance is the poor acting by certain roles, and mismatched characters. The two main ""assassins"" were terrible fits for the role, and even worse actors. Especially the female assassin. That was some of the most horrendous acting that I have before viewed - it was painful to watch. They were supposed to be elite hit men for a private contractor running black ops, a former navy seal. Yet those employed under his wing were the opposite of military turned hired gun. It seems one of the main antagonists was nothing more than a poorly chosen publicity statement.In the end the entire series is this: Misogynistic VP who Is an abusive father and mistreats his daughter. Not only is he abusive, misogynistic, and Republican, but he hates middle eastern ethnicities and is an unrestrained, hateful racist towards Arabs. The entire series you will hear him constantly belittle a rant about the terrorists and why a specific one needs to die. He's even willing to kill Americans and his own President to ""protect America at all costs"". How patriotic.The acting is terrible. The story line is terrible. It's lacks any sort of realism. The characters and their relationships were horribly bland... I definitely don't recommend it by any means.",3
North America,"Just gonna make this short: the dialogue for this show could really have been written by chimps on their day off from the zoo.. I sure hope that these guys aren't on the current writers strike, cuz if they are worried about being replaced by Chat G B T?? Then it's an insult to Chat GBT..The actor who plays the guy in the basement, should have stayed there. What utter bull sh#t..Most of the other characters are probably embarrassed by being on this show.. The hitmen/couple can kill everyone in site except the 2 main characters..I tried to give this show 2/3rds of the episodes to see if it got any better, but alas it didn't.. I suppose idiots & dullards need something to pass the the time, but any intelligent person should stay far away.",2
North America,"Title reference to the VP. Watch it and you will know why.This is a Robert Ludlum style - bad people in the whitehouse. Starts off good, but the acting. Oh my word! The acting was like a 10th grade play, during rehearsal. The story was sort of predictable, but entertaining. But it felt so amateurish.The lead character was ""ok""; the lead girl was much better. Everyone else: cringeworthy performing and scriptwriting.The location shots seemed very bizarre, as if there was no expense for sets - they just turned up at a parking lot to film action.The ending area, where a house was blown up, really looked like they had gone to Ikea for the set, and couldnt follow the instructions properly (as we all have that problem).I guess this was a low-budget item - I only vaguely recognized one character from anything else I have seen, so money was no object (i.e. It simply didnt exist).But it was ok, enjoyable to watch, just I hope they dont do a second series.",4
North America,"Is this show worth close to 10 hrs of your time? I think most would say ""yes,"" but not enthusiastically. The basic plot line is interesting enough. The acting is good for the most part. However, it did feel like couple of the characters were miscast. There are several plot holes and sequences of events that defy logic.I almost stopped watching it couple of times throughout the show, but decided to stick with it. After finishing the show, the best way to describe my viewing experience is that I just watched a rough draft of a potentially very good show. There are actions sequences that definitely could have been executed much better and some other details that left much room for improvement. I just wonder what may have been if this show was produced with a bigger budget and with input from other talents and experts.",6
North America,"Sutherland character was great but at the end taking over all super agents by himself is a weak storyline to end with

North America,"Excellent plot very unique I must say. Peter looked and portrayed his part best .Loved Dianne Farr for her saving the day attitude and under all that emotionless character she still loves her dear friend Potus would've wanted her to be innocent though. It's exciting on many levels,characters are perfectly picked for their roles. I would have likes Rose to join the Secret service too. Can't wait for season 2 if there's going to be one. It's been a while since something so fresh came to our screens. Night Agent is the best action tnriller I watched thus far. Absolutely loved it .This was truely ,truely enjoyable to watch. I know for a fact that Rose and Peter wil display more romance in season 2.",10
North America,"The Night Agent is a Netflix series that starts out with a decent premise but unfortunately takes a turn for the worse towards the second half of the season. While the show is entertaining to watch, it is ultimately let down by a script that becomes increasingly absurd and convenient as it progresses.The series starts out with some interesting twists that keep the viewer on the edge of their seat. However, as the story develops, it becomes clear that the script is more concerned with moving the plot along than maintaining any sense of logic or believability. Things seem to happen at the convenience of the story, which can be frustrating for viewers who are looking for a more grounded and realistic experience.The acting in The Night Agent is below average, with some conversations between characters feeling downright stupid. While there are certainly moments of tension and drama, the lackluster performances from the cast can detract from the overall experience.Despite its flaws, The Night Agent is still an entertaining show to watch, especially for those who are fans of espionage thrillers. However, it falls short of its potential due to a lack of attention to detail and believability in the script, as well as subpar acting performances. While it may be worth a watch for those looking for a quick fix of action and intrigue, this gets increasingly painful during the last two episodes as it ultimately fails to deliver a truly satisfying viewing experience.",4
North America,"Storyline is good, bit over the top and sometimes farfetched (watch the ending...), but hey, so was the Die Hard-cycle... every episode ending makes you curious about the next one and that's a plus.But the acting is so poor, with, for me, mostly unknown actors, which could be refreshing, but isn't this time. DB Woodside and Eve Harlow are the pleasant exception.Between the main characters, our night agent (Gabriel Basso) and his female IT-partner, there is no chemistry at all. Basso resembles a young Schwarzenegger, and his acting skills are likewise. Luciano Buchanan is a walking cliché, sorry to say. The rest of the cast is mediocre at its best. The president looks like an office secretary, no offense. I could go on, but see for yourself.",6
North America,"Hard to dislike a series like 'The Night Agent'; It has a decent, thrilling enough storyline, overall good acting, especially by the charismatic and efficient Gabriel Basso, has a cutely clichéd romance with good chemistry between Peter and Rose that add sweetness to the storyline ensemble and above all it flows entertainingly well, making most of us glued to the screen, while sometimes having our cell unused in hand, just in case!10 episodes that I hardly noticed flying by with an ending opening new and deserved horizons for Peter. Being separated from Rose by multiple continents doesn't seem fair though and I hope that they will be together soon again cause phone calls are not enough for me.Screenplay/story: 7Development: 8Realism: 7Entertainment: 7Acting: 7Filming/cinematography: 7.5Visual/special effects: 7.5Music/score: 7Depth: 6.5Logic: 6.5Flow: 7.5Action/drama/thriller: 7Ending: 7.",7
North America,"Although the trailer left little doubt about the kind of slot-filler this show was I got fooled into giving it a try by the good reviews and now I will have to live with that mistake for the rest of my life. How naive of me.This is your usual unimaginative deep-state conspiracy thriller that hooks you with a big mystery to keep you engaged in spite of a tragic lack of inspiration. Poorly written, botched plot, cheap twists, cheap sentiments, appalling dialogues, embarrassing hand-on-heart patriotism... there isn't one cliché this show doesn't resort to to fill an episode. Even the action is so-so.Perhaps it's your kind of show and you'll have a good time watching it, but don't expect it to be anything else than factory-produced entertainment.",4
North America,"Well this caught me off guard, I started watching it and before I knew it I was wondering if I could cram another episode in before bed.That's not to say it's the best thing ever, It felt like a high quality low budget production and there are some rather questionable scripting ""moments"". But as we've seen, you can have a truck full of money and still produce a complete stinker (looking at you Amazon & Disney).Overall it was a decent enough watch to keep me entertained. The two main leads do a good enough job and the script thankfully plants these two with their own strengths and skills that aren't encroached upon by the other. The male lead (whose name totally escapes me - sorry!!) I thought was pretty solid and certainly helped carry it through when other parts waned. Overall the script and story were pretty decent.It's no Jack Reacher (the series) but it's a good runner up.",7
North America,"Cliches galore, terrible acting - 'Peter' is about as expressive as a washing-machine -, the worst lines ever written for a series - could only have been written for an American series ('I love my country', 'You take care of her, huh?', 'I couldn't (forget you) if I tried' among countless others), sickening patriotism ('the leader of the free world'), and gross predictability in all possible plot lines from the budding love story to the final countdown or patronising president who rewards the heroes of the day.The whole series looks like a washed down version of the British series Bodyguard. Even the heroes look alike. The only difference is that when one kept you on the edge of your sofa, the other just makes you cringe at all the happy coincidences (she's a computer expert, naturally, which is going to be soooo useful to thwart the bad guys' plan), the unimaginative filming, the incompetent actors' direction, and the total absence of tension or feelings.Waiting expectantly for the next season of Bodyguard. Hoping Night Agent will have a long night's sleep.",5
North America,"We were looking for another political thriller to watch so we thought this might be worthwhile. I'd seen some very positive reviews so we tried. Wrong! The dialogue is ridiculous, the acting is wooden, the story makes no sense and we decided this 45 minutes into the first episode. Turned it off and went to bed. Don't waste your time with this drivel instead find a good British police procedural like Line of Duty or the excellent French spy thriller The Bureau. Why can't Netflix make a series for adults where the characters are more like real people and the story is intriguing not a rehash of so many previous series? At 2 stars I think I'm being generous on this one.",2
North America,"From the first episode, I was hooked and couldn't stop watching. Binged the whole show in two days. Something just kept me watching this show, even though it has its problems and shortcomings. It's at times very silly and predictable and cliched. A lot of the story is very implausible and the hero as usual in American shows has very thick plot armor. Still, I enjoyed this show very much.Gabriel Basso was well suited to this role and his performance kept this whole show together. The other actors were ok, but nothing special.Overall, a very predictible and cliched Hollywood show, but still it kept me watching. Maybe that says something about the overall state of entertainment, that this show gets an 8/10 from me and is one of the better shows out there this year. Anyway, I'm eagerly waiting on season 2.",8
North America,"It's quite good, actually. Even though there's something missing out from the plot or a little lack from the character. Like everyone said, it needs a little more improvement with the writing. Some of the story just off with the actual logic. The low class FBI agent who deal with a big case. But Gabriel Basso's acting cover up the script. Unlike the main female character, I feel no emotion, especially in the early episodes where she just had a terrible incident with her aunt & uncle on a fairly short time. But yeah, it's still worth to watch for keeping up your day on weekend. I quite enjoy it. Maybe if they gives us another season, I'm expecting some significant changes from the script and the acting.",9
North America,"Think of every cliche in this genre and it's in here. Don't bother. Series like the British- Bodyguard are what shows like this should strive to be but fail miserably.From the very start of episode one you can literally predict not only what is going to happen next but also what the conversation is going to be.Awful writing, average acting and a low budget are recipe for disaster.The constant twists and and turns are so bad that it seems like the writers were just throwing things in to see how much they could get away with...
There are tons of series out there with better story lines and acting so don't waste your time.",5
North America,"I saw the show sometime in March and honestly, I got to say it lacks depth and any shred of realism. Episode 1 started somewhat okay but by the time I got to the 4th, I just couldn't anymore. It felt like the show writers/directors were intentionally trying to gaslight us. It was vividly predictable from the 2nd episode (I mean literally too easy) for anyone with an ability to discern which is about everyone, I think. There was virtually zero cohesion between the casts, the lead actors had no chemistry whatsoever. The lead actress Rose was a constant pain in the ass everytime she was casted... stone-faced, cocky and ungrateful. Two of the most important people in her life were killed and she barely shows any emotion!! Apparently, she also seemed to be better at being an agent than he was, straying the plot further away from reality. The acting was bland and very cringy at too many moments. The Farr lady with the ugly overworn, silver wig could have been easily replaced with a robot. Zero emotions, too many needless F-bombs, even with her pale and emotionless character, I wasn't convinced she conveyed the role of an authoritative figure(I doubt that's her fault though). The assassin couple characters were totally unnecessary and out of place, one might think with the amount of screen time given to them, they were relevant to the show but they weren't. It was just a dumb and failed attempt at trying to keep the show lively. Plotholes here and there, all over. An absolute false reflection of how security agencies are run. All these aren't surprising though, what really surprises me is how people think this is a good show and the hype around it is just ridiculous. U want to watch and enjoy a good spy series, see The Bodyguard, Slow Horses and Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan. They aren't perfect but they are way better than this action-craving, amateurish and simplistic joke of a spy thriller. I'm starting to think 3 stars might even be too generous of a review.",3
North America,"Intriguing story overall, but too unbelievable to engage. Chief of Staff looks to have too much time (based on West Wing),
What father tells her 8 yo daughter she's to blame for her sister dying- on the day the her funeral - and what 8 yo doesn't cry when hearing that.Who is calm enough to try to bond and conspire with/against a kidnapper that just shot your lover in front of you.What person is up for sex the day after seing their aunt hanged by murders trying to murder you too.If you're looking for a smart spy-series with clever political schemes and raid intriguing dialogue. This is not it.This is just a Netflix mass production from a cheap script.",6
North America,"I think some negative people need to give their heads a wobble. Not an 'Oscar winner'? No... but I found it an enjoyable 'binger'. When you look around at some of the dross that wins best film these days? That nobody goes to see? The leads all gave perfectly adequate performances, enough 'F bombs' to make it realistic. It must be hard enough actually working in a place like the Whitehouse, but a room with no windows and just a clock aand phone? Rather bleak indeed. Like I said, I enjoyed it for what it is. A few hours away from the rat race where you root for the good guys. What's wrong with that?",6
North America,"The story was entertaining in a 'don't think about it too hard' kinda way and the cliffhangers on each episode were masterfully done. Unlike many Netflix shows, the ending of the season was actually complete and satisfying which is a sad high note in today's television where shows like The Diplomat end abruptly with no resolution to nearly any of the dramatic threads.The downsides to this show are difficult for me to look past. The acting overall was terrible. There was almost no chemistry between the 2 leads and the romantic stuff was down right embarrassing. The Farr character was simply the worst and nearly all of her lines sound like it was being read off a sheet of paper. Nearly all the characters were shallow and none of them grew or developed in any way. They all were 1 trick ponies from start to finish.Overall, I would not say this watch was a waste of time but also not good enough where I have any lasting excitement for season 2.",7
North America,"Let's start with the bad.... So many plot holes and a bit cheesy to be honest. The main character is a tad annoying and seems to know more than the FBI and other government agencies put together. The head of the FBI personally attends scenes best left to his agents and his interrogation tactics are to simply shout at people. How did he get this far up the ladder which such outstanding leadership skills?Looks good and some of the characters are likeable/watchable along with the action scenes etc.To be honest, I've no idea why Netflix cancelled the amazing Mindhunter but made this instead? It's a poor man's version.",5
North America,"I don't understand the good reviews, truly. The acting is terrible, the dialogue is too rigid, the story is extremely predictable and not remotely realistic or believable. Are we just that desperate for something new to watch that we make excuses for terrible shows and acting? There are so many character stories crammed into this show and not a single one of them are interesting. There's ten episodes but yet the dialogue is rushed the entire show and don't get to any point in the story until the very end. It almost becomes comical how amateur-college-project-like they speak/act. Take my word for it and don't waste your time.",2
North America,"The storyline is great. The intensity level isn't quite there though. It would be great if this level could be on par with ""Bourne"", ""Jack Ryan"" and ""Condor"". Not going to give in though. I believe this has the potential to become even greater.Eve Harlow's performance as a crazy psycho, loved it. In some scenes she even looks like a female version of Rami Malik, no offence Rami.It's great to see D. B. Woodside again. Would love to see his character continue into future seasons.It was a shame that Robert Patrick's character didn't last long. Again, another character that could have been utilised in future seasons.Can't wait to see more.",7
North America,"Sutherland actor is good. Main actress is acceptable. Everyone else is bad.The writing is bad:
""Why would you serve this country when it hates you for being black?"" ""This is how patriots get it done!"" *Dirty hicks in DC attacking a woman*I stopped watching for a few weeks and it was so forgettable that I forgot everything about it, including how bad it was, and tried watching again. No thank you.If you don't want to think about the show at all and you don't mind the strange political inserts, then it could pass the time, but frankly I am not curious how this story ends and will not complete it.",4
North America,"Picture this. I'm an FBI agent and I get a call from a woman trying to hide from bad people hunting her down in a house. I tell her to check if the bathroom door closes on the inside. Lo and behold, it does. I tell her to lock it from the inside but to close the door without going inside, so the bad guys will think she's in there, buying her time. What? Yeah, I know. Absolutely brilliant idea if it weren't such a huge stretch of imagination and coincidence. There are very few bathroom doors that do that, and for good reasons. You'd be locking yourself out and breaking down your bathroom door on plenty an occasion, especially if you have kids.Next, I'm in a car chase with the woman these unknown bad guys are after. I complain I can't see their number plates. On a lengthy bridge, a crash ensues. Loads of people are hurt, cars have crashed all over the place. The criminals are trapped there; luckily we get away. So what do I do? I drive to a friend's airbnb house. And don't call a team of cops. Don't send anyone to the bridge where a bunch of criminals (trying to kill me and the woman I'm protecting) are trapped. And where, by the way, people might be dying. What what?The woman I'm protecting refuses to tell me what the guy who tried to kill her looks like. She doesn't tell in case there's a rat who'll want her dead if she tells. What? A ""rat"" would actually have a lot more motivation to kill her while she DOESN'T tell, as once she's told, killing her would be useless, or at any rate a lot less useful than while she's still alive. But I - hotshot FBI guy - don't bother to enlighten her.Next, unstable spies pull guns with the intent to use it on cops for a speeding ticket pull-over... Er, what?That pretty much sums it up. Stupid good guys, stupid bad guys. I switched off hoping they'd end up killing each other all in one go during a shoot-out.",2
North America,"You really need to suspend all belief when watching this show, being brain dead would be a bonus.It's certainly stretching things saying it's political or a thriller.Unfortunately none of the cast are convincing in the weakly written roles they inhabit however well they are delivering their lines.How this got the greenlight I don't know but then again the dross that is churned out for streamers these days at best this is mediocre.The security services being either so inept or corrupt is just a joke. The Vice President being involved in a plot to assassinate a reformed terrorist that would involve hundreds of American citizens alao dying on US soil is also utterly ridiculous.",3
North America,"Everyone saying this is a ""fast-paced"" show only watched the first 2 episodes. These episodes are a great draw into the show, but it quickly devolves into nothing but dialogue for the meat of the story. Character development for unlikeable characters is very common. An absolutely glacial movement of the plot. You're given less than a breadcrumb of action or suspense per episode. And this is for the entire middle of the show! Characters are introduced that take multiple episodes to make any difference to the story. Dialogue upon more dialogue upon more dialogue. This show could've been much better if it were properly paced and he fluff was cut out. A badly paced show.",4
North America,"The characters are cardboard cut-outs. They're stiff and wooden. The script is laughable. People talk like no one really talks. People act like people wouldn't act. There are no character arcs. There are no true motives to push storylines. By the last episode, nothing very much really happens to differentiate from the first episode. Everything could have happened in one or two episodes. It's boring. It's inconsistent. It's dumb. Every event happens for plot convenience. The good guys always have their plot armor. Some characters come and go for no reason with no development or arc, even though the episodes focus on them from time to time. By the end of the series, you wonder what the point of their character was. All that wasted time could have been used to further the main characters development. I found myself wanting to play on my phone or empty the dishwasher rather than watch this show. This is a sci-fi channel quality show at best. I gave it two stars only because one star reviews hold a special place for shows/movies that are bad on purpose and I can unplug my brain to revel in their stupidity. This show actually thought it was clever, which makes it that much worse.",2
North America,"After first scrolling through some reviews here on IMDB I wasn't sure if this would be my type of series. After watching the first episode I was dedicated to watch the others and I finished the series in one week. Don't expect amazing special effects, the best accents or the best actors. But expect a good thriller series where every person could be part of a big plot. Due to a good combination of action, drama and dialogues this series keeps you glued to the screen. A plot that will change constantly and make you wonder who can still be trusted. A must watch if you like a combination of thriller, action and political drama.I hope there will be a season 2 and I can't wait to watch that one.",9
North America,"I have been using IMDb since it's inception and have never written a review previously. Read the other bad reviews - there are plenty. I would just be repeating their criticisms. This series was as bad as everyone said, I guess. I'd have to watch all the episodes to be certain, but I certainly won't. I couldn't get beyond the first episode... I can only add that it was so bad in every possible way (except for the basic conceit, which was intriguing) that I started writing this review before the credits rolled on that first episode. To me the true mystery is the 7.5 average viewer rating. That usually means the series is pretty good. Not this time. Do not pick up the phone!",3
North America,"I've got no idea how this piece of predictable garbage has managed to get 7plus ratings . Story is too lame, acting so unnatural and casting is the worse. No one seems to be connected with the plot itself.This show can easily be considered to be on the list of tbe most pathetic series of the year. There's nothing interesting and it just keeps on getting dragged unnecessarily.The most irritating thing is after 2 episodes, the main plot jist goes inside the drawer and all the irrelevant parts are taken out and that does nothing but to bore and frustrate. It would have been better if it were just made a movie.",4
North America,"...the script! The actors, locations, action, pace, photography and direction were all acceptable. I would expect no less from a spy thriller, which is one of my favorite genres.So, if you're like me, you'll watch the whole thing, hoping it will get better or, at least, a little more believable. You know who you are, even if I can't exactly recommend the series to you.Kudos to the actors for being able to utter such trite dialog amid inexplicable plot twists and cringey dialog.I truly think the ensemble did the very best they could with what was given to them, but I imagined them shaking their heads - just like me - during their first read-through and thinking ""Seriously?""",4
North America,"Most will laugh, but for me, I refuse to binge shows. Night Agent almost, ALMOST made me go against my own method of watching.With that being said, I would watch one episode a week and it wad the longest week ever. I couldn't wait to get to the next episode.Night Agent is filled with action, and great acting. Especially for names I didn't know. I was always a big 24 fan and this filled my emptiness that was Jack.Lots of plot twists and edge of your seat suspense. The last two episodes I had to practically remind myself to breath.Sure, there are parts that are a bit far fetched but guess what? This is Hollywood and not real life. I'm not going to go in detail about the show, just grab the remote, press play, and let your mind free. Great job Netflix with this one!",10
North America,"The writing seems lazy and rushed. We do expect some bad guys to have poor aim but we are expected to ignore obvious blunders with reality.There was some real potential for this storyline to take you places, but it really seems that there was a lot left on the table There was some real potential for this storyline to take you places.If you need an example for me to prove my point. In episode three, the agent and his girl are parked on the side of the road and the bad guys just take a left when the agent was in plain sight.Are we supposedsed to believe that they wouldn't look right...This is from the creator of The Shield, absolutely no comparison. This is from the creator of the shield.",6

North America,"An utterly engrossing tale that makes chess sexy, not words that normally exist in the same sentence.I'm on my 4th ep' and know I'll watch the lot today, with a rude interruption for a trip to the doctors, bummer. The rags to riches story is gathering pace, tragedy will almost certainly follow, but that's a guess. EDIT - Yes it did, sooner than I thought, and the decline into self medication almost ends the whole adventure. There's a review on here that questions the use of the early addiction story as pointless and even offensive. They obviously have no clue as to how childhood trauma shapes us for the rest of our lives. Add that to the fact that child care used drugs to subdue and control children in institutions up until the 60's and in some countries much later.There will almost certainly be negative reviews calling this 'PC nonsense'. Stuff 'em, history is full of brave and intelligent women, just ask Cleopatra or Marie Curie. Beth Harman is fearless and totally determined to do things her way. Her plan is simple, be the best by beating the very best.Anya Taylor-Joy is the perfect choice, a lot of shots are of players staring at each other, and her huge brown eyes are the star of the show and she uses them a thousand ways. Her adopted mother is the organiser and recognises the earning potential early on, even if she knows jack about chess, she certainly understands the dollar. What starts out as a money making scheme becomes quite a touching mother/daughter, even sister relationship but avoids un necessary sentiment. My assumption was that her adopted mother would be a barrier to Beth's aspirations, as all of the women she'd encountered since her dead biological mother with very sound life advice were. Yet she let Beth live the life of her choosing. There are plenty of examples in this series of women holding other women back, whether it's down to social convention or just the idea of 'not fitting in'. Without her would Beth have become Beth?Netflix have smashed it out of the park, again. The high production values and excellent casting, plus an adaption being praised as 'close to the book' makes this a must watch series for gals and guys alike. It's definitely one for snuggling up on a cold evening with your significant other.UPDATE - I've finished it, in one day as predicted. The finale is fantastic, I don't mind admitting that I cried, in a blokey, happy way.
UDATE OF THE FIRST UPDATE (because I watched it again) It was better, by a mile.",9
North America,"The ""Queen's Gambit"" series is based on the 1983 novel by Walter Tevis.
This show doesn't disappoint from the book, in fact it is enthralling! Well directed and shot the story follows an orphan who develops an affinity for chess and prescription pills. Developed by Scott Frank and Allan Scott the show premiered October 23, 2020 on Netflix. Headlining a talented cast, Anya Taylor-Joy is incredible. Her performance exceeds expectations and her heartfelt moments are riveting.",10
North America,"For this reading keep in mind I'm halfway through EP2 at this point. Also this kind of series is the type I adore to watch always.I'll reserve judgement until later but GOOD GOD who decided upon the production decision to make the ENTIRE first episode about ""a before the events of this series"" little girl episode?The entire series is supposed to be about Anya Taylor Joy as a chess player with mental issues. Yet rather than a carefully curated 10-15 minute explainer of how she was as a child.We get a full blown repetitive and extremely dry 1 hour episode of her being a pill popper as a child. This is the introduction that is supposed to keep viewers hooked?I'm stunned at the idiotic decision makers who thought that was a great way to introduce a fairly cerebral TV miniseries to the audience. I'll keep watching to see if it improves but the first episode is undeniable horse droppings.
How they thought the first EP would draw anybody in to want to watch more is beyond my understanding.",6
North America,"This TV Mini-series is excellent! It is wonderful to see Anya Taylor-Joy in a well crafted show. She shines brilliantly as Beth Harmon a chess playing prodigy. The story takes us from when she is a small girl, orphaned, continuing through her teenage angst years. I highly recommend this show. Great cinematography and directing and of course to get back to the acting - its top notch! I only wish there was more than 7 episodes.",10
North America,"More intense than a good thriller,more dramatic than a good drama....The power of Queen!!!!",10
North America,"Top to bottom, scenic design, wardrobe, direction and casting, this is a top notch production. The acting is seamless and the characters embody their roles perfectly.One couldn't hope for a more original or more compelling story. As you might expect from the title, Chess plays a central role, and the author's use of the game as an extended metaphor shifts in ways both nuanced and explosive. For any thinking person, this series is sure to delight.In my opinion, strong characterization always provides the best entertainment. The producers of ""The Queen's Gambit"" tackle the tough task of creating a compelling story from the inner lives of the characters. Granted, they are working from an excellent novel, but oftentimes, attempts to bring works that center around the mental, rather than the physical journey of the central character fail miserably. In this case, the producers deserve the highest praise. If you like thoughtful stories that expose the inner lives of the characters, don't miss this one.The show, while generally acceptable for children, contains several adult themes, so parental guidance is recommended.",10
North America,"The right Spanish title according to Netflix, it'sGAMBITO DE DAMAKind regards",3
North America,After the first two episodes I cancelled my friday night plans to watch this series in one sitting.,10

North America,"I did not expect it to be this good. Really pleasant to watch. Great acting, music, story, cinematography. Would recommend.",10
North America,"The color of the show is absolutely fantastic and the camera work is oustanding. Ofcourse, it wouldn't all be amazing if it wasn't for Anya Taylor Joy. Incredible actress, with such a way of capturing the scene.",10
North America,"Wow, love this show and I've only seen the first episode. Reminds me of what I used to be like, not playing chess tho lololol....",10
North America,"Chess is cerebral. This series is not.Scott Frank has made films from Logan to Wolverine. This one is somewhere in the middle. The direction and writing is clichéd to the point you can guess their dialogues.It juggles too many ideas; genius to madness, woman in male dominated field, orphan dealing with past. But everything is mismanaged. Also what's up with like 4 montages in every episode. THAT'S SO LAZY.Anya Taylor Joy is the only saving grace. Her and the production design make the show watchable. Also the chess moves and techniques are pretty accurate that's kinda cool.",7
North America,"I didn't think I'd find a show about chess players this enthralling, but I did. The storyline was beautifully written, so raw and even suspenseful. Anya delivers a beautiful performance, I have a soft spot for characters such as the one of Beth Harmon: brooding, keen, admired, yet terribly flawed, struggling mentally, and unpredictable (Like Annalise Keating from HTGAWM). I liked that it didn't turn out to be overly romantic, as I had been expecting. Although one could argue, historically speaking, that a woman competing in a very male-dominated sport during those times would have had wayy more obstacles thrown her way from the men's side, it did warm my heart to see so many of her male opponents adore, admire and support her wholeheartedly. Beautifully empowering without being a gigantic political statement (saying this as an avid feminist.) Definitely worth the watch, also the camera work is very pleasing to the eye as welm as the color palette, loved the aesthetic!!",10
North America,"I just watched the first 5 episodes straight, and it is perfection. There's just something about it, it's well acted, scripted and shot. It has the same vibes as the movie ""A Single man"", which too was stunning.",10
North America,"3 episodes in and I still haven't been told anything about chess, what makes her a strong player and so on, I had hopes as the show started by naming the openings and I felt maybe ideas of the game would be mentioned and also impact the plot, we get nothing only name droping chess lingo to make her seem good at chess, it also doesn't help that they couldn't be bothered to get the position of the opening that the title is named after(it gets mentioned in episode 1),her rise is also too fast and i can somehow excuse this as it being fiction and all but it just seems too ludicrous, within months of playing beth can beat a chess coach (which should be nearly impossible as she has only learnt a portion of the game namely the opening, she hasn't learnt the middle or endgame which already is a very big skill difference )
then we get to the chess tournament stage, I can excuse the first tournament even though it felt very lackluster and downright impossible,
the second tournament threw me off more, she is to play a 2 hour game without prior experience or even an inkling of preparation for something so mentally demanding and she does so quickly and easily against a top player I just can't bring myself to believe it and this has nothing to do with her gender no human can do that.
in short we haven't learnt anything about her chess how her personality affects her playstyle or anything on chess in general it is a sport show about an athlete without us knowing anything about what approach said athlete takes in conquering the sport, a lot of unexplored aspects of the game were missed.aside the chess it is a good show i guess but I feel at the very least the ideas and principles of chess should have been mentioned and the matches given more care.",5
North America,"A truly remarkable show with a splendid cast who played each of their roles marvelously. Chess players will surely enjoy all of the amazing factual (also fictitious and sometimes way over the top ) chess jargons and lines that are thrown about, but non chess players will enjoy it alike.Best scene? The one where Beth visits the orphanage basement after news of the janitor's death and finds her picture with him along with all of her news clippings that he had carefully curated together. That scene had me in tears.This series outdid 'The Pawn Sacrifice' by a mile and a fictional story of a female Bobby Fischer was better told than the real one.",9
North America,This kept me on edge ! Very cool !Very cool !Very cool !,10
North America,"You should definitely watch this incredible show. Yes, it's Netflix(it's just almost all shows here are same), but not like his other shows, so different and so good in his on way. Anya Taylor-Joy - amazing and talented actress. Go on, watch it.",10
North America,An incredible series. An absolute joy to watch and a complete surprise. Anya Taylor-Joy was wonderful. I honestly have never heard of her and she was absolutely perfect for the role. I would have loved to see it last so much longer.,10
North America,"I was very hesitant at first. The first episode could easily have been boiled down to 20 minutes; or spread out throughout the series. It's like most prequels: stale, and quite unnecessary.Episode 2 is where the suspense starts to form. Stellar performances from both Anja Taylor-Joy and Marielle Heller. Their dynamic is what keeps the middle game interesting. However, I would like to see more of how the death of her alcoholic step-mother affects Beth towards the end game. The tension keeps you going, but the emotion is not (quite) there. You could say Elisabeth's addictions are what keeps her closed off; but frankly, that's just lazy (or rushed) writing. I would've liked to see the end and the beginning more closely tied together throughout the series; rather than just a last minute circle compositional construction.From where Anja takes the rains from her rather lacking child predecessor, the stress is palpable. Moving pieces of white and black could only be so interesting if you're actually interested in the game in the first place. From easy tactile moves, to gradually advanced difficulty: makes you feel the drive and the intellectual growth of the protagonist.The experience, all in all; is more rewarding than the end itself, as it doesn't leave you feeling brain-dead. Playing chess is exciting, stimulating - thrilling. The series captures that unremittingly.Side note: I would've liked to see more exploration of Beth's sexuality. Since it's quite considerable, as it is a seemingly important part of the first scene.
As Alma (stepmother) says: ""I think you just don't like Manuel."" (men well)",7
North America,"A brand new series that is a period history that takes place in the late sixties. The beginning shows her parents dead in a car crash she walks away from. Thrown into an orphanage at the age of nine, she acquired an uncanny taste for chess (which I love) and the green tranquilizers they gave the children in those backwards southern town then. (A century earlier it was morphine and opioIdes). It is surely a dark comedy like the new nurse Rached that popularised Netflix recently also! I think you'll like this new series as much as I. Truly depraved enjoyment! Pax, Murf",10

North America,... u-need not-know much-all bout-chess... this-mini-series is wonderful... Taylor-Joy is-a-star,10
North America,"Many years ago I was an excellent chess player. Then one day I realized no matter how much I concentrated on games, and I could anticipate several moves ahead......Basically I sucked.I can't help but draw parallels to Bobby Fischer, but I believe the protagonist of this series, Beth Harmon, would eventually have a much happier life than Fischer.The actress, Anya Taylor-Joy, is destined for great things. Her portrayal of the shy damaged girl was fantastic. Anya Taylor-Joy took Beth from a shy ugly duckling to an exquisite, but naive beauty, who is totally unaware of her smoldering sexuality.I reviewed this series as ten stars not because I used to play chess, but on account of a original story, well acted by all involved.I recommend this series very highly and if you like episode one, you'll be hooked.",10
North America,"It's not only a good series, it's not only the wonderful story, acting, cinematography, music. You watch it and it feels like the movie itself is a chessgame. With a rather weak opening indeed, a fabulous middlegame and a perfect ending. It's the kind of movies/series that stucks you in your armchair, on your couch or even in your bed anyway, forgetting about eating, sleeping, living. After the end, the return to reality has not yet occurred. You are still tormented in dimly lit orphanages, you travel all over the world, you are welcomed in super-bright chess tournaments a little more arrogant and well-dressed and you analyze variants. Do not miss it!",9
North America,"I don't know the first thing about chess, but this had me captivated from the first episode. Some reviews are blasting it because it had too much chess? Others say they didn't like the back story? Makes zero sense, the story is about a chess prodigy, and her back story ties to every part of her life and how those events unfolded. The casting was superb, directing was phenomenal, I could go on. My only complaint was not closing out a few story lines but I also they were minor and didn't affect the outcome of the story itself. I rarely write reviews but had to for this one! It sucks you in and leaves you satisfied, by way of wanting more but only because it's that good, not because the ending was bad. When awards season comes, this better be a winner, lots of garbage and bad acting/writing lately, this is by far a winner!!",10
North America,Beautifully filmed. The phrase binge worthy was created for shows like this. I've never played chess in my entire life but I could not stop watching this series. A must watch for anyone who appreciates talent and genius. I didn't have to think about the 10 stars I gave it because it absolutely deserves everyone.,10
North America,"For a fiction story it is very boring, we don't need to see endless games with predictable outcome.
I had to fast forward after episode 3 as I couldn't take watching one more game.
Do not recommend. I don;t understand the high rating.",2
North America,Very basic script and a one dimensional arrogant teen whose good at chess is basically the whole story. Very disappointing. It's beautiful to watch but that's about it.,3
North America,"I got excited to see female chess players represented in pop culture, but my expectations were not met unfortunately. It's a visually beautiful yet cheesy drama series, and that's all to it really. It could have been about ice skating and it would not have changed the show or the story line. The serie implies professional chess players are good looking rock stars who take an average of three seconds to make a move in a tournament. If you have even been to a chess tournament, as a player or spectator, this is not the show for you.",6
North America,"Watching ""The Queen's Gambit"" was the best viewing experience I've had in 2020.
Intriguing characters and a great story were accompanied by memorable visuals. The camera enjoyed zooming in on Anya Taylor-Joy's unique face. Her stunning closeups with her huge eyes conjured up images of a beautiful Area 51 alien. A Netflix promo showed one of her closeups for less than 5 seconds, and it immediately caught my interest. This series was much more than visuals. It was a wonderful story of friendship, even though for much of the series it can seem like a story about isolation and self abuse.The filmmakers made chess seem like the most exciting game in the world! I never thought I would enjoy watching other people play, but the filmmakers were very successful.Young ""Beth Harmon"" was played by Isla Johnston. I applaud her casting and her performance. She was very believable as the young Anya Taylor-Joy. She was the central focus of the early episodes growing up in an orphanage. I think we will see many more films with Isla Johnston as she grows up.Some of the series takes place in Russia. Netflix did a great job in Chernobyl of giving us an appreciation for the Russian people. I also loved their treatment of the Russian people in The Queen's Gambit. It was amazing to see how chess to the Russians was like baseball to Americans.I really don't have anything critical to say about this series. I was immediately taken over by the story. The visuals helped keep me intrigued, and I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen to Beth Harmon. I was with her every minute of this approx 7 hour series. I cried and cheered. If you are stuck at home or even if you're not stuck at home, I highly recommend this series.",10
North America,Maybe the best Netflix series. This series is a must view.Fantastic.,10
North America,"Excellent cast, storyline, cinematograpy, acting and music. Simply one of the best series I have seen. Feels like The imitation game, Genius (Einstein), The Theory of Everything and The man who knew infinity combined.",10
North America,"This was a series that surprised and amazed. Who knew chess could be so mesmerizing? ATJ does a wonderful acting job here, understated, heartbreaking, triumphant. Don't miss this series because you don't know a thing about chess. This is about life. Beth's life, her struggles, her discovery of chess, her friendship, her losses, her wins. See it.",10
North America,"What a show honestly. I usually never post reviews but this one just felt special. I've had this show on my reminder list since I read the synopsis a week ago. I thought it was going to be a decent fun watch, but boy was I in for a ride. From the directing, the cinematography, the SCORE (this alone deserves a 10/10), and the acting is phenomenal. Anya Taylor-Joy beautifully showcased her acting and honestly made you experience her character's journey from start to end. To sum it all up, this show is keeps you at the edge of your seat, it is a thrilling rollercoaster while somehow still maintaining to be an emotional tear-jerker. Please do yourself a favour and watch this masterpiece.",10
North America,"Watched it all in one night.
I didn't think a story about chess would keep me interested. But this one got me deeply invested.
Because this is not just about the game of chess, it's so much more.Ultimately, what I cared about wasn't just the game anymore, it was the person. I was rooting for her. I really cared what would happen to her and that's probably the most essential thing for me when watching any tv series.What made me attached to this character was how I saw her grow up from a little orphan girl, witnessing her from the first chess game all the way to the end and everything in between.
I was enthralled, inspired, moved, proud.
Had me in tears too.
Excellent cast, story, cinematography, writing, everything.
Thank you for this. Thank you.",10
North America,"After Netflix cancelled one of my favorite shows, I was close to canceling my subscription. This miniseries changed my mind. This is one of the favorite things I have seen onscreen in a long while. Everything about this show was perfect for me, including the fact that it has a beginning, middle and end. Anya Taylor-Joy is amazing. I would watch her in anything. If this doesn't win awards, I don't even know anymore.",10
North America,"This is not the typical type of show that I would usually watch but I'm so glad I did. It's so unique and different that it's difficult to put into words. If you're thinking of watching this show, just do it, you won't be disappointed.",10
North America,"Perfect, I saw all the episodes in one day. I did not expect it to be this good. Really pleasant to watch. Great acting, music, etc.
I have only one word: Excellent.",10
North America,"I wasn't expecting much from this but I loved it straight off the bat.I really thought this was a true story such was the strength of the characters.Anya Taylor Joy is superb in the lead and she keeps you glued to the screen all the way through.You will not regret watching this.
It's one of the best I've seen in a while",10
North America,"It's really good! One of the best series I have ever seen - on all levels of production: great cast all the way around, beautiful cinematography, wardrobe, music score and an engaging and addictive script!",10
North America,"And was very surprised. The preview was kind of blah and didn't drive me to watch this at all, only because of Anya did I turn it on and wow. All the actors, the costume and set design, the story, the pace of the story, everything was executed extremely well.The few bad reviews on here, I'd just like to know what these people consider good? If you're looking for a movie about the fundamentals of chess and how to play it watch a damned documentary, not a drama. If you think this was boring, maybe you should stick to action movies. Some critics on here judge movies for things they are not and were never meant to be and that's just dumb and childish. If you can't tell what you're getting into before watching something you have no valid opinion on the subject.",10
North America,"I never really liked drama movie/series; I'm more of an action-movie guy. When I saw the title of this movie I must say I was captivated by the movie description and the beauty of this actress. So, I decided to watch it.
From episode 1, I was captivated by this series. No matter how many times my work, friends & family, interrupted me while watching the series, I kept coming back to it. It was WORTH IT!. This movies shows Talent, Grace &, above all, gave me Hope.
I'll say no more. Watch it, you won't regret it.",10
North America,"Great mini-series on Netflix. Great acting and excellent cinematography. The only downside is missing her background in the first episodes.
The rest of the series is amazing, it has pressure and a great idea.",8
North America,"I loved it! The acting of Anya was great, the colours, the quality of filming, everything. I enjoyed every moment of it. I am happy to see Thomas Sangster playing in another miniseries.",10
North America,"Binged the entire series, excellent, story, setting, colour , drama , suspense.
I'm disappointed it's finished, nice touch and finish to the story. Enjoyed every tick tock, tick tock minute!
Well done Netflix and great performance from Anna-Taylor Joy! She nailed it... Checkmate!!!",9
North America,"Put down all other genres for this limited series. Spot on! No drama, no soap opera, just well written and respectful portrayal of a woman in a man's world, rising from nothing and how brilliance leads to success. Can hardly wait to see how it ends. Oh and if you weren't fascinated with chess before, it may be time to set up the board. Well done Netflix. It's been a while.",10
North America,"The queen's gambit is a very strong and smart written TV show and one of the best TV shows on netflix this year
Chess games shows and movies need a very smart writting to success and to connect drama with the game world...
And this show did it very good.",9
North America,"I have no words to descrive the intelligence of this title. This is a drama, a thriller, a slice of life... All around the story of this chess master has a sense. You'll be identified with your fears, shame, and regrets. Don't miss this show. I used to hate the lead role actress, now I love her. Great, really great job!PS: Two days later... i feel so good to remind this thing that is in my head. This fact made me chage my 9 to a 10. At these strage days, thank you for bring us things like this. Chapeau!",10
North America,"As I write this, the goose pimples have yet to recede; the tear in my eye has yet to dry. Overcoming the travesties of life, Queen's Gambit celebrates reaching excellence, as a film well done, and as Harmon achieves excellence, personally and professionally. Well done.Anya Taylor-Joy was not only subtlely superb, her surrounding cast showed the magnificent progress we humans can make, when we reach in and help out. A triumph of the human spirit.I found the ambiance of the mid-sixties profoundly well orchestrated. The costumer, Gabriele Binder, deserves big trophies.The conclusion where Beth finds ""Scheibel"" again touched my heart, head, and hearth. Thank you Tevis and Frank!",10
North America,"I rarely give 10 stars, it's one of the best things I've watched in a long time. It's beautifully written and acted, the lead was wonderful. The only thing I'm sad about is I know I won't watch something as brilliant as this for a while.",10
North America,"The details of this show are brilliant. Even the lighting changes and slight narrowing of focus between the movie's current and flashback timelines that slowly unveil the making and, at times, unmaking of a brilliant mind worked seamlessly to orient the film and the main character, Beth, within the winding storyline.It's a marvel that somehow nothing in this film is flashy or explosive, but it is still imbued with edge-of-your-seat drama - and all over a series of chess games. I hadn't the slightest idea how they were going to make a chess story engaging, but there it was: all of the intensity of a boxing match fit into a wordless exchange over a monochromatic board game.Needless to say, I was thoroughly impressed. The actors were subtle, sometimes unnervingly unreadable, leaving one with the very distinct impression of having been a part of a conversation in which no one ever over-explained anything to you, like a traditional production might. No one ever tapped you on the shoulder and whispered in your ear ""I smirked, because I am indulging you,"" or ""I laughed, because I enjoyed your joke,"" but the interactions in this show left you with a sense that the characters were more human, claiming a sensation of more nuanced ambiguity or uncertainty in each exchange. Perhaps more than that, perhaps bequeathing a strange sense of autonomy to Beth and the men of that world as they rarely smiled and often remained veiled as they interacted and internalised the action around them.The costumes were art.The only real fault I saw in this show is how each episode seemed to expend a character, only inserting them when Beth had a need of them and disposing of them by the time the plot of that episode had concluded. A veritable rolodex of parental figures, friends, and lovers only existing to be sampled, tried on, and put away wet. I'm sure this decision was to reinforce the idea that Beth is the central character of her own story and chess was her only constant companion, but the expendability of characters that evolved around her felt callous and unrealistic.Anya Taylor-Joy's performance was excellent - nearly flawless, though, in the first few episodes, her playing a 15-year-old, pretending to be a 13-year-old seemed to lean a little heavily into the absurd.Finally, while what really drew me to this show was the presence of Thomas Brodie-Sangster', and his perennial ability to sew a distracting level of endearing, cerebral charm into every character I have had the pleasure of watching him play, his costume choices were never contextualised, which made him seen more like a British man dressing up as a ""Florida man"" for Halloween than a sort of quirky chess player. Generally, I also found the show under-utilised him, shifting him too harshly from role to role as he, in rapid succession, seemed to change into a completely different character in each of the four episodes he was in.In conclusion, I would highly recommend this television show.",9
North America,Was pleasantly surprised by what a great story this was. Highly recommend this to anyone.,10
North America,This series was outstanding. Phenomenal story and acting. It keeps the viewer interested throughout the entire series. The story does not become cliche or lose steam at any time. Anya Taylor-Joy plays the role of Beth Harmon to perfection. I highly recommend this series. It's been quite a long time since I've watched such an excellent series.,10
North America,That what it was and I loved it. I wish we had such unique well made shows.,10
North America,"One of the best new shows of this year, amazing performance by a goddess Taylor-JoyShe truly deserves an award",10
North America,Amazing underdog story. Kept me interested throughout. I truly appreciated how the head matron at the orphanage and her adopted mom were nuanced characters not just your typical caricature of mean or uncaring.Worth the trip.,10
North America,"I wasn't sure what to expect from a show based around a game I've played maybe 3 or 4 times in my life... but this was all so well-done and kept me on the edge of my seat! Everything was thoughtful and deliberate. It grabbed my attention in episode one and didn't let go until the end. In addition to incredibly detailed sets and cinematography, the acting was truly top notch. It's a multifaceted treasure that outshines most of the series being released these days.If you're feeling skeptical, just watch one episode. It's sure to please.",10
North America,"One of, maybe best series I have ever seen!
Not much of a pro reviewer, but I do know when I see greatness.
This series is a must watch, especially for anyone who has played chess.BRAVOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!",10
North America,"Open a beer or two, and make sure you watch this one in one sitting. It deserves to be eaten in one sitting. Outstanding!",10
North America,"Best Netflix show i watched in so long i cant even remember last time i was this impressed. This was magnificent tv, thank you",10
North America,"Just excellent on every level. Dynamic characters with brilliant acting, great time-piece imagery, fast and appropriate pacing, I couldn't stop watching from start to finish. Explores the pressures of success and how it can lead to alcohol/substance absuse and the strength it takes to rise back from it. You don't have to be any sort of avid chess fan to enjoy this, I can't recommend it enough.",10
North America,"Another winner by Netflix, one of the very best Series I have seen this Year. It starts off a bit slow since the main Character doesn't really do a lot of Dialogue.Instead, much of the Story is told thru Visual Cues, like the expression of their Faces, what is happening around them, or thru the Dialogue of the other Characters, so it does need some bit of getting used to.But once you get the hang of it, the Story just flies and flies and flies. Anya Taylor Joy as Beth Harmon was magnificent, but Isla Johnston was equally magnificent, if not more so as she totally owned the first Episode as the young Beth.I know how to play Chess, but am not a big Fan of it, and I thought that the Creators of the Series did a fantastic Job of making the Game understandable enough to be appreciated by anyone who doesn't know about it.The Series is mainly about Chess, but it is also much more than that, it is a Coming of Age Story, a Thriller, it tackled Alcohol and Medication Addiction, Relationships, etc.Director Scott Frank's last collaboration with Netflix, the Western themed Limited Series ""Godless"" released in 2017 was also a Masterpiece, and now I am a big Fan of his, I am looking forward to his next Series.A Must-See, as I mentioned before, one of the best Series of 2020.",10
North America,"This miniseries is excellent. Everything is perfect, The performance, the script, the score, the soundtrack, the visuals and the shots. I never thought a story about chess would keep me so interested. But, this one got me so invested. The character is so well developed, so much connection that I started rooting for in an instant. Anya is so graceful, so well mannered and so focused in her game. Truly fantastic. The production design is so well and her costumes are so great, stylish yet so classy.Incredibly talented Anya shines her way from the start to finish. This series actually had me captivated from the start. An excellent drama, MASTERPIECE!
Really glad I watched this show. Actually, binged it. Totally worth it.",10
North America,"This show was outstanding from start to finish. The acting was superb, the cast was perfect, the story was interesting, the wardrobes were on point, and the director did a terrific job. I highly recommend you watch this T.V. show.",10
North America,You must watch this mini serie. Anya Taylor is great actress. In my view this serie is greatest serie/movie about chess. Final scene was emotional...,10
North America,"When you've seen everything on Netflix, a you will watch any new show they throw at you. I did not have high expectations. But I was so wrong. So wonderfully and totally wrong.
We watched Queen's Gambit, all seven hours of it, in a single sitting. This show is an absolute gem. Remarkable acting by Anya Taylor-Joy who will be a force to be reckoned with, her child counterpart- an absolute marvel. The series is smart, it's inspiring at times, it's sad and heartbreaking at times. Who knew watching game-plays of simulated chess can make your heart pound out of your ears? Truly, a story of determination, friendship, self discovery, struggle and triumph. I don't know about you, but my ceiling will be covered in chess pieces tonight.",10
North America,"One of the easier 10s I've given out lately. I just rushed through this show in one sitting. It's gripping, it's interesting, it has a message and is never dull.I'm a sucker for sports and competition shows, so that helped aswell. Anya Taylor-Joy did a fantastic job as the fictional ""Elisabeth Harmon"".Not much else to say, just watch it, you won't be disappointed!",10
North America,"We have been waiting since the great 1993 film ""Searching for Bobby Fischer"" for another good chess movie. The wait is over baby!!
Netflix has released the seven-part limited series called ""The Queen's Gambit"" This amazing series details the life of a nine-year-old orphan girl who learns how to play chess and then takes on the male dominated chess world.
A fun and exciting movie watching this little girl grow up into a beautiful woman. We watch as she experiences life while trying to master the game of chess.
Don't miss this great series! (Just finished binge watching the whole series and it is 4:30 am, I couldnt stop watching!)P.S. I want to be clear the series is incredible and I loved it but, if I had to deduct maybe a half a star it would be the many flashbackack scenes during the series. Helpful but a little excessive to me.",10
North America,"Great story, great series. Engages, entrances, beguiles, romances...Some people mentioned the lead character and her development, but so many of the supporting characters were great too. Just really, really good television.",9
North America,"I was trying to think of any flaws...I couldn't.
Just a great series and you should not miss it.The only reason i could see you would not like it, because its not your genre type.Great acting, great styling and cinematography. Great writing casting. Pretty much perfect.I particularly loved the originality. When did you see a drama series focusing on chess the last time?Exactly! It was refreshing.The only little thing that irked me were the very few times they had to use CGI fir the historical context. Ut was ok, but not great.",9
North America,"I played chess (a bit) as a teenager although I was not very good at it. That was a long time ago and if you'd asked me yesterday I would have told you I wouldn't be interested in watching anything about a chess prodigy and her battles with drink and drugs.However I spotted this on Netflix last night and I thought I'd give it a go, pretty much because there was nothing else on that I fancied watching. I finally went to bed after watching the first 5 episodes and would have stayed for the last 2 if I wasn't too tired to give them my full attention.The story starts with an 8 year old girl being orphaned then sent to a home where the janitor ends up teaching her to play chess, realising that she is a natural at the game. At the age of 13 she is adopted by a dysfunctional couple and finds out that you can make money by playing (and winning) chess tournaments. Cue her rise to fame accompanied by her addiction to drink and pills. Along the way she acquires a group of friends (although she doesn't always realise that they are).I've seen the final 2 episodes now and can't recommend this enough. The acting is excellent and the story zips along, keeping you engaged with the main character's successes and disappointments along the way. It did take me till the last episode though to figure out where I'd seen her friend Harry before - he played Dudley Dursley in the Harry Potter films, although he's a much nicer character in this.I was a bit cheesed off with Netflix this week after the dreadful Rebecca adaptation but they have redeemed themselves with this. I haven't read the book of The Queen's Gambit so can't compare them but I will say the series is fabulous.",10
North America,"This show has everything i wanted
complex female character , accurate depiction of chess , good acting , compelling story . Watched it all in one night and i am hungry for more",10
North America,"Very compelling. I loved to storyline, wardrobes and the MUSIC. I also loved all the symbolism in the show. Starting with the title, ""The Queen's Gambit"" is a chess move where you sacrifice the queen to win. Beth sacrifices her relationships with everyone around her just to become victorious. In the orphanage, Beth's one identity her mom makes her (the jacket) ""so you know who you are"" is tossed away, and in turn giving her no identity. Her mother's last words ""close your eyes"" I believe spark her into a rebellion to keep her eyes open. We see this all throughout the series from staring at opponents to looking at her ceiling at night. The janitor that mends things around the orphanage, mends her but helping her get her identity back with chess. When they referred to white going first in chess, her friend says ""white always wins"" was a nod to racism in the 60s. Even the watch her foster mom gave her represented that she was on the right path, but broke when she spiraled down.Great show. Just give it 5 minutes of your time and you'll be hooked.",9
North America,"There's a natural instinct to hesitate before giving any movie, any show 10 out of 10 stars - aren't I being hyperbolic? Does it really have no weaknesses? Does it really deserve a perfect score?
Having thought through all of that, the answer is ""yes"".
From the story, cinematography and editing, to the acting, down to the score and soundtrack - this is a show that perfectly follows the line between heavy and entertaining, realistic and exciting, gritty and hopeful.
Couldn't recommend it enough.
P.S. I'd never even dreamed that I could find chess in any way exciting, let alone this much.",10
North America,One of the best from Netflix. There is really nothing bad to say about this. The acting is amazing. The camera work is truly great. The story itself was spellbinding. You don't even have to know chess to enjoy this. I wasn't sure if I was going to like this or not. Now I'm sure. Bravo Netflix.To the person who said taking illegal drugs makes you a better chess player: You completely missed the point. She was a genius level chess master but it wasn't until after she stopped drinking and taking drugs that she was able to reach her full potential.,9
North America,"Old man, doesn't play chess, binged the series.
'Nuff said",10
North America,"Haven't seen anything like that in a long time. Amazing acting, characters, the soundtrack deserves a 10 on it's own. Don't listen to me, GO WATCH!",10
North America,"After binge-watching ""The Queen's Gambit"" in one sitting after its release, I was mesmerized by the acting, the directing, the symbolism and the sheer beauty and details of the story itself.
""The Queen's Gambit"" is a story about an orphan's life to adulthood in the flow of chess game; the story truly has a clear opening, midgame and endgame. What really matters in the story is our main character's, Beth's, decisions and growth in character throughout the series. With the help of extremely detailed character-building situations and dramatic misfortunes, we see the story of a character which we all could learn something from.""The Queen's Gambit"" tries to tell the viewer a simple but an important message: both life and chess are complicated and hard to learn, but with right preparations and mindset you can correct even your worst mistakes and overcome even the hardest of situations. You are the master of your own life.In conclusion - This series is something you will want to see, were you a chess player or not. There is something for every viewer to take away from this beautiful story about life and growing up.""Let's play.""",10
North America,"The cast that assembled was second to none, with most charterers actually having meaningful scenes and one or two stealing a scene here or there which is a credit to the script and direction.Taylor-Joy is exceptional, and Marielle Heller unrecognizable as her mother, a truly stunning performance. Special shoutout to Harry Melling and Brodie-Sangster who helped glue the storyline together, but at the end of the day Taylor-Joy nailed this series (film) and should be awarded at some point for this stella performance.",10
North America,"Too many montages, too many threads the show has trouble following. I get the angle of the young girl learning to become an adult despite all the odds, but you end up with issues forgotten between episodes, etc.
But it's quite good for a Netflix show, some strong moments and tension that you can enjoy.",7
North America,"Wonderfully written, wonderfully acted. Treat yourself to this gem.",10
North America,Really enjoyed this series. One reviewer gave a low rating mentioning how the first episode showed her using pills in the orphanage....yes they had to as it shapes the rest of her future. The characters are great and the acting on is superb. Kept me hooked!,10
North America,"There are losers in this story - several of them women. However, they were the victims of overwhelming odds being stacked against them. In setting the substantive parts of this story in the late 60s we witness the times a changin' and that talent and will power can enable female success. We are never overly spoon fed as a viewer and there is enough narrative tension and intrigue to keep us engaged. A brilliant production with great script, acting, effects, sets, and costume. Especially love the pom pom hat and outfit alluding to the chess piece queen of the title.",10
North America,"From orphan, curious child, to chess prodigy this movie chronicles the life of a beautiful and isolated cold to stunning woman!! I LIVE THIS!! I wish there was more!!",10
North America,"I don't think I've ever been that engaged watching something that moves so slowly. I'm not sure what it is exactly, it's hard to put a finger on what makes this so captivating, but all aspects of the show were exceptional. Great acting, writing, plot development. Just a truly great work of storytelling. Highly recommend.",10
North America,It is an incredibly captivating show. I never imagined that a story that I came across on Netflix by chance immediately trapped me for a whole weekend,10
North America,I gave this show a shot on Netflix and was pleasantly surprised! Hands down the best mini series I've seen all year and potentially a story that will linger with viewers after. Once you hit the 2nd episode the series really picked up steam and I found myself binge watching until completion. Don't miss this show!,10
North America,"Almost every day im checking on imdb on new movie & series releases to find something that might capture my mind and feelings. And then this...A story about an orphan girl, abondened, full of anger and without self-esteem.Living to herself aimlessly in an orphanage with strict rules. The only freedom she can find lies between her thoughts & imaginations. She discovers chess and puts the board to the center of her mind.That orphan against the world motif is not very new. But how this story is told leaves you stunned. What intrigued me the most was how beautiful the scenes are staged, when she dives into the depth of her mind. How these scenes are designed to emphasise with Beth getting lost in variations of chess strategies is incredibly engaging.
I guess most people imagine chess players rather as nerds who are socially shaken off and therefore escaping to a board game. The series showcases very well that chess is more to those who play it. They marvel at the beauty of the game.As a chess player myself im happy to have finally watched a show subject to chess, in which the players are not making ridiculous moves or which is just super boring. The affinity of highly talented players to drugs and the different types of chess players are also authentically reflected. Believe me, at every chess tournament you have a pair of chess playing twins and minimum one guy who dresses like a cowboy - and one Russian of course ??",10
North America,"Best show 2020. great actors, great storyline. thx netflix :-)",10
North America,"Just when I thought I had run out of things to watch, I stumbled upon this absolute gem. This was perfection, and it appears many other reviewer's agree with me. I just wish they were more shows like this, it was just absolutely fantastic.",10
North America,"My only criticism is the very beginning in the orphanage and Beths first encounter with chess seemed quite far fetched considering she had zero knowledge of the game Trang's or not.
That aside the production settings story acting is First Class and addictive.to watchI also played chess when in my junior school age 7 and have always loved the game nothing near the standard of this story however this show will not only win awards but I truly believe it will revive an interest in the great gameHighly recommend",10
North America,I was immediately emotionally invested. Superb character development and so well edited. The score was just beautiful. Even though I don't know all the rules in chess this was still very captivating and way more exciting than thought it would be. I highly recommend it to anyone who prefers quality over quantity.,10
North America,"Story is 10/10, Actors 10/10, the soundtrack and the way story is laid out captivates you to watch it in one whole sitting.And for our Precious Anya. Oh my godness. it was pure joy to watch her act it all out. I can tell. She is going places. This role is played to perfection and can only open up more challenging roles for her. - Wich she well deserves. Everyone else in the movie played their roles splendidly too! afterall a great tv show takes a whole team to pull it together. :)Never written a review before, so be gentle with me guys. :)",10
North America,"I have so many words I could say...on the other hand this piece of television perhaps is best described by two 'Absolutely brilliant'. Thank you to 'everyone' involved in this production - TV/Film/Drama at its very, very BEST!!!!",10
North America,"I binged watch it and great storyline! Love how I related to the show in a sense with the ups and downs of life in general. We all go through tough times and having to listen to others but not doing them, is the best!",10
North America,"I do play chess, however very badly. My husband was actually rated at one time and kept beating me! This movie was FANTASTIC! It captured so much from the very beginning to the emotionally charged ending. Although chess was it's main focus it certainly wasn't its only focus. Such a STRONG cast, brilliant writing, directing, everything about it was, in a word PERFECT!",10
North America,"What a great show?
Nice works , great acts and very interesting.",10
North America,"Agree with most of the high-rating reviews here. This is how a movie/series should be done, congratulations to all crew ! Glad there are still intellingent and talented people to do this, which - sadly - is less and less often in our time.",9
North America,The Queen's Gambit holy mamma Mia I love it I love it!!! Best mini series I watched it in 7 hours direct,10
North America,"Amazing story, great acting, delicious execution. You will love it.",10
North America,"Just wow....was falling out of love with netflix after a weak run of shows but this is so good.....amazing acting, beautifully shot and intelligent and sensitive storytelling!!!!! More like this please netflix",10
North America,I don't normally review shows but this one was fantastic! I watched the entire series in less then 24 hours and would watch it again in a heartbeat. Every episode is good. It stays strong the entire series and captivates you. I would not be surprised if this show wins tons of awards. 10/10 would recommend.,10
North America,"All it takes is just one role, one script to turn things around for your movie career. Anya was made for this role and she did an excellent job. I was lost in the story, practically binged it in a day. Beautiful done i wish i could give it more than a 10. Well done to the whole crew that put this together. A must watch, don't be shy give it a go. I smell some awards for this.",10
North America,"This is a brilliant mini-series centring on the themes of addiction, loss, and friendship. Anya Taylor-Joy is absolutely brilliant, the writing is well done, and the supporting cast is wonderful. It dodges cliches successfully while telling a very charming, funny, and sad story. One of the best things I have watched this year.",9
North America,"Not the kind of show I usually watch, but I watched the entire series in one sitting. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen!",10
North America,"The Queen's Gambit was a random find for me. I started watching it without any expectations but the first episode was just enough to keep me interested. As I kept watching, it kept getting better and I must say the 7th episode was one of the best finale to a series that I have ever watched. The character developments for even the minor characters were well-thought-out and I immediately formed an emotional connection with most of them. The finale was so well done that it almost felt like an end to a show with several seasons rather than a limited series. The show also had very good messages sprinkled in between, they were subtle and didn't make me feel like an agenda was being showed down my throat. The acting was marvelous. The cinematography was great with some very impressive scene transitions. The score was amazing and really set the atmosphere and the tone of the show. If you are reading this before watching the show, go ahead and watch it. You won't be disappointed.",10
North America,"I know only the basics of chess and am an appalling player. I understood nothing of the strategies and only barely know the names of the positions on the board. . Despite that, this was mesmerizing! It's a beautiful film cinematically. It is heartbreak and triumph. It is the good, the bad, and the ugly of humanity. It is the struggle and dedication of talent and craft. I wasn't sure this would hold my attention, but I couldn't stop watching and it! I couldn't help feeling it! I don't know how anyone made a series about chess so riveting, but it was a beauty!",8
North America,You will binge watch this like I did guaranteed. What an amazing 8 hour movie.,10
North America,"AT-J is going to be the IT girl of 2020's. The Queens Gambit is the perfect combination of star and script . Understanding that the clothes play a hugn roles as the title characters goes from an orphan to young woman of the 1960's, the costumer pick the perfect dresses to express Beth Harmon,s controlled feelings.This is beautifully shot and directed and is binge worthy",9
North America,"The title says it all...not much to add, its just perfect.",10
North America,"Captivating, mesmerising, and very beautiful.I actually stopped playing on my phone, and put it away.",10
North America,"It was near perfect. I would have liked a little more depth of characters because they were so interesting. And I think the last episode could have been more drawn out and suspenseful. I think it would have been perfect with 8, or maybe even 10 episodes to cover what I mentioned. It was just so good that I wanted more...",9
North America,"I am not much of a chess player; I am that not interested in the strategy game at first. But the television mini-series did keep my heart pumping fast each time the lead character, Beth moves a piece. Her journey in chess, addiction, pain and drive to become a grandmaster is addictive. And I am in love with Anya Taylor-Joy's acting and facial expressions. Worth the binge-watch. Might even push you to start taking chess.",9
North America,"When I saw Anya Taylor-Joy on the cover I knew I had to check this out. Can't go wrong with this one whether you like chess or not. Its prolly the only chess thing on TV I've seen that doesn't feel cringe IN THE SLIGHTEST with all the use of chess terms,movements etc. Everything felt like the actors were actually chess grandmasters. Insanely good production, top notch acting, everything was on point.Although I expected it to be good, especially since its freaking Anya Taylor-Joy, I didn't expect it to be THAT good!",9
North America,"The script and editing is just perfect that keeps you glued. Also anyone who has seen Bobby Fisher's HBO documentary would relate with his story line from KGB, Russia, Anxiety and the ending with a duel between the two (Borgov vs Harmon) representing the two Super Powers.The actors did a fine job. The ending the opening and everything in between was just perfect.Can expect an Emmy and Golden Globe",9
North America,"There's not much story, but pleasant to watch, good acting.",7
North America,"Takes a bunch to make chess dramatic, this show did a great job",9
North America,"I adored it, start to finish. Everything about it was amazing. I'm speechless to how truly amazing I found it",10
North America,"I was just searching Netflix & I didn't had any idea about the series . I started the first episode & I couldn't stop until I finish it . We need more series like that .
Anya Taylor is remarkable",10
North America,"Masterpiece, Yeah That's How you start for a Compelling Story of this Kind... I Don't even the Adjectives to Describe this... Definitely One of a Kind... I Mean If you Look at the way She Portrays Herself, This Girl Nails the Role of Harmone AKA Beth.... Arguably The Best in Recent Times.. The Soul , And I mean Music is Top Notch... Go For It...",10
North America,"Just an absolute joy. Just watch it.Once you start watching it, you are hooked.",10
North America,"A stunning masterpiece, I loved every second of watching. I don't know how I'll find anything else that compares, this is some of the best tv I've seen in a long time.Acting, direction, & cinematography are all perfection, and the pace takes you throughout her growth as a young woman, which was an absolute joy to watch. The visual palette is beautifully vivid, every scene is gorgeous. The script is well-written and poignant. The characters and their relationships with Beth are emotional and yet realistically portrayed. Beth herself is quite a unique and interesting character to watch.I initially watched this for Anya Taylor-Joy, and she did not disappoint. She captures the screen with such poise and nuance that it's worth watching just for her facial expressions alone, which allow us to witness her inner life and thoughts. I felt her joy and her pain, and I rooted for her victories, despite never playing chess myself. Safe to say that I cried several times.This is my first review on here, but I felt so compelled to write this in admiration of the show. Thank you to everyone involved in creating this masterpiece.",10
North America,"This is the only TV show that has grabbed me so absolutely, and so quickly. I hold it in the same esteem as The West Wing and The Newsroom which have been my favourite TV shows for over 20 years now.
I really hope they keep developing new seasons, it would be a massive waste to lose what this show has started.",10
North America,What a joy to watch ! I enjoyed every minute of it . Funally again some good stuff on netflix,10
North America,"This series is a thriller. Chess thriller. I have very little knowledge of chess yet i loved this series. The actors are really really good. The production is very detailed and good, you feel like you are in 1960's.",9
North America,This show is filled with excitement in the most subtle of ways. The emotions played by Harmon are both natural and relatable. It's very engaging. Her demeanor and overall personality is an absolute joy to watch. The young Harmon's stubborn yet competitive nature is also refreshing to see rather than the usual male protagonists.The show is binge worthy - makes you feel like a genius because you get so immersed with the character and storyline. 10/10,10
North America,"You'll end up like me, binge watching it until 5 AM (and I don't even know anything about chess). Very well written, directed and acted.",9
North America,"Who would've thought chess could be so tense and exciting.
Watched all in one sitting, transitions through each episode seemless and keeps you entertained and focused throughout with ease making it an easy watch.
Acting was fantastic and heart felt.
Must watch.",9
North America,Despite it being a good show you'd actually thought this was any European country in the 1950's and 1960's. Why? because there seems to be an awful lack of black people in this version of America. I found the unsegregated children's home a bit too far fetched as It's a rose tinted version alright but the chess play is great.Then again it's a fictional piece of work.,8
North America,"One of the best series I have ever seen - on all levels of production: great cast all the way around, beautiful cinematography, wardrobe, music score and an engaging and addictive script! I could not stop watching and feeling everything the main character felt and everybody in between. All of it mesmerizing, so much so that I had to quickly find the cast online to prove to myself that it was a Netflix movie/series - my brain did not believe it. The ending was magnificently touching; and you come to know that the leading actress and chess prodigy has not changed in her heart - she surely remains the child in the orphanage that we saw at the very start. I cried happy tears a few times.",10
North America,"These shows get better and better, a great script, so well acted, so well adapted by all the actors a really enjoyable great show. Bravo",10
North America,"Music, acting, directing, story telling... This is a rare masterpiece! I couldn't stop watching!",10
North America,"What else can be said save for spectacular?
Yeah, that's the gist of this marvel so feel free to stop reading please, and thank you.I might be biased, I love chess. I don't play and probably never will. Something about being able to see the board 16 moves 'ahead"" of your opponent is surreal and supernatural to me. For this, Grand Masters and Wizards are of royalty to this neophyte.The acting was superb. You know that moment when the lead needs to propel the story? Well that happens multiple times...kudos to all the cast.The pace was just right for anyone in any condition if you catch my drift. I binged the whole kit-and-kaboodle, and never once, considered the time, Oh so refreshing folks:)Wait. Not true. I was fast-forwarding, editing in 'mee own time' so you might want to control the throttle a bit for sure. But overall, you're looking at 1 night, or a 2 day excursion and you'll have yourself a piece of time that was not wasted.",9
North America,"While I am an avid chess player, you do not need to love chess in order to love this series. This is the first time I have ever given a rating a perfect 10. The cast is beyond amazing, Anya Taylor-Joy did an outstanding job. The story and writing was brilliant. The cinematography was perfection and captured every little detail for the time period. The music was perfect!The only disappointment is that there probably will not be a season two.",10
North America,"This mini series has everything one would want in a great show. Acting, cinematography, value, the whole thing. Its got ups and downs and all around. Just watch it. I dont care for chess much but this show is beyond great. Award winning.",10
North America,"One of my favorite actresses Anya Taylor-Joy (Emma, Thoroghbreds) is captivating in this abstract, unique, compelling journey through the world of chess. The storyline tension between disaster and vindication haunts the viewer until the very end.",9
North America,"A real thriller, a must watch. Anya Taylor-Joy is brilliant",10
North America,"This is one of the best series on netflix, it has outstanding acting, beautiful imagery and a compelling storyline which gets you hooked from the first episode.",9
North America,"It's very rare, at least for me, to get hooked from the very first minute. The Queens Gambit has it all; marvelous, Oscar worthy acting from the main lead, great cinematography, superb score, fascinating costumes and era representation. It's a series with hardly any flaws, with intensity that makes the audience identify with the heroin, suffer with her, rejoice with her.It's the best series of Netflix for 2020 (and perhaps for many years to come). Make sure you don't miss it. You won't get disappointed!",10
North America,What a gem this was. Hard to stop watching. Binge-worthy for a good weekend of viewing!!!,10
North America,"Drugs and Genius , Netflix promotional drama series of the benefits of drugs . I suppose in reality 1000s of students today are popping speed to study and enhance their intellectual stamina. Regardless is that what we have become a society of drug addicts just to achieve at academics. This movie like series is well written acted and directed but unfortunately it's message is that of loss sadness and abuse with little empathy for its characters. Performance enhancing shown in a different light .",6
North America,"Really enjoyable series and for the reason that it is unashamedly a feel good series, yes there are some poignant scenes and even a tear jerking one toward the end but you never feel uncomfortable watching it. Most series would have had the janitor who thought her chess, arrested or fired after being accused or suspected of some form of abuse, after all a young girl spends lots of time alone with a man in a basement. Many writers could not have resisted the urge to mine this dramatic theme and pain us by seeing this man unjustly accused. When I saw they did not I knew that I ciould relax and just enjoy a high quality feel good show, much needed in these turbulent times.",9
North America,"Isla Johnston and Anya Taylor-Joy are both superb as the younger and older Beth Harmon. I'm a chess player so the plot of this series was quite appealing to me. Just to sum it up, it's all super good and quite moving in places. I wish there were more episodes! I'm so happy it had a happy ending! I'm now in love with Anya! Wow! She was so amazing! I really have zero negative criticism of this project, five stars all around! Highly recommended! Would love to see a sequel!",9
North America,"I don't know where to start... I am usually very critical of movies and series, and nitpick a lot. I am rarely pleased by stories and movies in general.This series although predictable due to known history and outcome, is amazing! The most prominent aspect of the series is Anya Taylor-Joy, she is truly an incredible actress, playing an amazing role with very believable and convincing acting. Anya is totally submerged into Beth Harmon, and I was totally submerged in this series. I have never met Beth Harmon obviously, and don't really know if her personality was being portrayed accurately, but Anya played an amazing character in this series.I highly recommend watching this series even if you don't like or play chess, as the focus is more on Anya's personality, struggles, and joy *during* the chess tournaments.It was an absolute joy to watch. Highly recommended.",10
North America,Something different that wasn't about murder or teen drama! It was fascinating and had a lot of depth!,10
North America,"I know nothing about chess, but this was just so enjoyable. The main character is very pretty in an unusual way. And exactly the same can be said about this mini series. Such a different but beautiful story about a girl/woman who goes through the most traumatizing life events in a sort of emotionally detached way while focusing on chess. And while chess is mentioned pretty much every other sentence, it's really about someone who goes through life all by herself. I loved all actors in this.",10
North America,"I didn't really have any expectations for this but I quickly found myself hooked. All of the actors are fantastic, it's brilliantly cast and the cinematography and direction is beautiful to watch. Imo, whilst the plot had an obvious direction it was headed in, there wasn't anything cliche or annoying. In fact I think the writing on this is some of the best I've watched lately. It doesn't try too hard, it's charming and doesn't rely on style over substance. Whilst there is a downward spiral for the main character, it doesn't ever get too seedy or depressing just for the sake of it. The characters are sympathetic and heartwarming, the wardrobes and set, glorious. There was just the right amount of chess to make it accessible to someone with no understanding of the game. Very enjoyable!",10
North America,"An actresse and Performance to fall in love with! Noticeable, close, charming and penetrating! An Amazing Cast! Believable and dynamic character relationships.
Great camera, powerful shots, lively editing, filigree but powerful narrative speed.
Costume design, a feast for the eyes!
Authentic, atmospheric light and colors with beautiful depth!
Film Music, finely tuned and balanced.
Simply Great! Fantastic.
One of the best ""Series"" I've seen.",10
North America,Great!!! It is soo inspiring and beautifully written and produced.,10
North America,"The Queen's Gambit
An extremely well done series.
It is designed to draw one in and binge watch to find out how well she succeeds with the seemingly stacked deck against her.
Of course, it is all propaganda.Beth is a liar, thief, drunk, drug addict, user of others to her own ends.
Her real mother and her unfortunate upbringing are supposed to elicit sympathy for her poor behavior, personal responsibility is never addressed.
All the old childish Spielberg tricks are used.
The Goodies (US) are bathed in bright light, dressed in pastels with Rockwellian behavior., all pulling for the team with implicit trust in the Captain and generally good sorts.
The baddies (USSR, once a Red always a Red) are in darkness, dressed in black, or like extras straight off the set of Dr. Zhivago, surly, bad tempered and distrustful of their aggressive leaders.The overall impression is that the goodies know how to succeed and have a good time whilst doing it but the baddies can only lose.
Whereas, due to the US Governments decades of misappropriation and misdirection of infrastructure spending the reality of the dystopian decaying wasteland is actually America.The fact that only 20% of Americans actually hold a passport, considering there is nothing worthwhile to the left/right/top/bottom of the promised land, helps immensely in furthering their isolationist belief in their superiority and acceptance of this type of brainwashing propaganda.The lead actress was very good as were most of the supporting cast.
YMMV",3
North America,"Watched it five times last three days, the final episode I watched ten times..You don't have to know how to play chess to like this movie, you just have to like the one playing..and Anya Taylor-Joy totally nailed that part.",10
North America,"I never intended to watch this, but I was looking for something new and this series kept showing up. Then ITFS struck. No regrets; it was an impressive and inspiring story. I say I don't cry at the end of shows, but I was proven wrong. This show made the characters people to me. I knew them, I wanted to know them, and I felt for them.I highly recommend you watch this, even if its not your preferred type of show to watch. It wasn't mine.",10
North America,"Actually one of the best, TV series I've watched in many many of years, fantastically done ,and absolutely loved every single minute of this TV series drama.",10
North America,I don't know how to play chess even i don't but her acting in series and story as well as relationships of her mom and her trainer you feel like worth a watch,10
North America,"This is well worth watching, if only for the wonderful acting, brilliant costuming and gorgeous sets. Anya Taylor-Joy is simply mesmerizing.If only the story wasn't riddled with movie tropes from start to finish. We're to believe Beth is a Good Person because she has a black friend. Never mind that she is thoughtless and rude to the man who is teaching her chess, self-centered and careless of other's feelings. She even casually tosses out a new doll in an orphanage filled with little girls who would be absolutely thrilled to have one. Her dislike of dolls is just another cliche' that says in order to be a proper feminist one must despise all things traditionally valued by women. Beth is rude to the girl who invites her to a party, but we know she's a Bad Person because there's a statue in her parents yard of a black man holding a carriage lamp.The most overused Hollywood trope of all is the Christian women straight out of a Dana Carvey, ""Church Lady"" sketch. Beth has deceived them in order to get their sponsorship money, but we're clearly meant to applaud her when she rudely blows them off.All credit goes to Anya Taylor-Joy that we still like Beth and want the best for her. Her performance is worthy of a better script.",7
North America,"Once again netflix delivers an amazing show with a great cast! The main character stays relevant until the last episode. Anya shows the best acting of her career. The script is well produced threw every episode and the director mixes all type of scenes from long and paced scenes, to a small and detailed one. De photography is well made and full of taste capable of capturing Anyas emotion threw out the show. Money well spent! Keep it coming Netflix",9
North America,"There are few shows you will see this year or any year for that matter, that will catch you off guard the way this show will. The score 10. The acting 10. The way they develop the main character through flaws, heartache, strained relationships, addiction, and the stress of being the best in her field... 10. Notice I haven't even mentioned chess. Because, this show isn't about chess. This show is about a girl no one wanted, who was loved by the most unlikely of people, who navigated adulthood with no adults to show her the way, and who also extraordinarily became one of the greatest chess player in the world. This show is about finding your way when there isn't a way, finding family when you have no family, and finding hope when things seem hopeless. I can't think of many shows that make me cry... this one got me.",10
North America,"I can play chess, although I haven't played for years and I was never very good. I can't honestly say I ever found chess to be 'exciting' until watching The Queens Gambit. I was completely hooked from the 1st episode, Anya Taylor-Joy absolutely nails her character and fully deserves an award for her acting. As a TV series the story and characters get to develop the way a movie never could.
It bears repeating, I never had any real interest in chess and, before this, you couldn't have convinced me that a series about chess would ever interest me. I was SO wrong. This is easily the best show I've watched all year and I can't recommend it highly enough.",10
North America,"The best mini series of recent times. Extraordinary holds a lot of attention. Impeccable performances, safe driving, smart script. AWESOME!!",10
North America,"As an avid chess player my whole life this movie was an interest when it came out. I was however un-prepared for the masterpiece that was delivered! This movie was nothing less than a once in a lifetime masterpiece, perfect in every single aspect. There have been few stories that moved my soul the way this story has done.The writers, director, cast, filmography and crew created a story and brought it to life in epic proportions. I feel like.. well, to be honest, I cannot find the words to describe the experience I had watching this series, it was life changing, eye opening.. I will forever value this blessing of having the opportunity to experience such a story.Simply MAGNIFICENT...",10
North America,"A perfect yarn spun by the director, actors & the rest of the production unit in creating this underdog drama about chess.. I'm so glad Netflix has picked up this incredible series.I loved every minute of it & there are a few episodes that I've already seen a few times.The music is outstanding & recreating the Cold War era & those iconic chess tournaments is just a master stroke.A limited series with unlimited satisfaction, enthrallment & perfect climax !!",10
North America,"A rare and remarkable mix of highs and lows. Individualism, teams, cultures, addictions and an array of lots in life. Our girl leans into the wind. Stoic yet full of passion. Elizabeth is driven; and driven by her struggles. Her losses escort her to excellence, while clarifying her identity along the way. She knows both winning and losing like most of us.",10
North America,"One of the best I've seen for many a year.Everything about it is topnotch. The audience is treated as intelligent enough to work out the finer points for themselves.The script, direction, cinematography and production are gobsmackingly brilliant.And the cast? Not a false note. Utterly believable. I was riveted. and the ending? Perfection!Kudos to all.10/10",10
North America,"Look, this might be the best series I've seen in years, and I don't take that lightly. As a watcher who has been turned off by series after series that have gone the way of appeasing different demographics of people, I found myself with each episode just asking myself, what is happening here? I LOVED the main character, and when I say loved, I mean I genuinely fawned over her. She never did something that left you saying, ""why the hell would she do that?"" or ""that doesn't make sense!"" She was built in 7 episodes better than most characters I've seen built in dozens and dozens. Let's talk about the side characters - Nobody really dominated the supporting character role aside from maybe her Mother, who was pleasantly flawed but as nurturing as she could be given her circumstances. Her relationships were complicated and fascinating, starting with the janitor, Schaibel all the way through to her arch nemesis, the Russian Grand Master, Vigor. You felt every emotion she went through, without it jumping out from the screen and slapping you into submission. And the ending wasn't written in a way to over-complicate and outsmart the watcher at home, it was brilliant. This will set the stage, and the bar, for other short mini-series that have gone the way of writing with everything but the story, and the characters, first.I just finished the last episode and couldn't wait 30 seconds to run to the computer and type this review. That in itself exemplifies how amazing this series was. WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU WAITING FOR, WATCH IT ALREADY!!",10
North America,"This show is nothing short of brilliant! Every episode's storyline is more intriguing than the last, and I thoroughly enjoyed watching it through the end. I recommend this show to anyone who wants to binge-watch because I had to finish once I started.",10
North America,"This is the best series I've watched in a very long time, I couldn't stop watching & binge watch the entire series in one day, I hope this isn't the end of Beths story & there will be many more seasons to come",10
North America,"This is the best series I've watched in a very long time, I couldn't stop watching & binge watch the entire series in one day, I hope this isn't the end of Beth's Story And that there will be many more seasons to come",10
North America,"So sat down and started watching, 10 episodes later! I just let them play one after the other. Wonderful actress!!!!! This series is much better than anticipated. Highly recommended",10
North America,"I rarely give a 9 but this one deserved it.the characters are complex, the story is compelling.the acting is great.i love how it's about womanhood at the end of the day.But what I love the most is how I could relate to it. Ultimately it's about conquering your demons and no matter what life has dealt to you, you can rise above it.",9
North America,What a phenomenal performance by Anya Taylor.Everything in this series is way beyond anything.One and only series made on Chess and with such a beauty.I feel too emotional while watching this show and connected in plot in such a way that I just binge watch all episodes.Thanks to Netflix for bringing such a great work.The animations of chess on the ceiling is marvelous and whenever the scene came I got goosebumps.A lot similar to Pawn sacrifice movie but this show contains so much more.For all the chess players this is a must watch series.,10
North America,"This is one that you have to see to the end. It won't let you down. If you liked ""The Hustler"" (based on a novel by Walter Tevis who wrote the novel that was the basis of this film) and the acting that made that story breathe, dance, and take you to the extremes of human triumph and defeat and everything in between, then this series is for you.Great atmospherics that make a perfect setting for fiction that creates reality without any schmaltz. Taylor-Joy is the real deal and is able to pull off everything that's thrown at her. And the rest of the cast make her even more believable. This is a treat from start to finish, and don't get distracted by thinking it's about chess-anymore than ""The Hustler"" is about pool.",10
North America,This is a Netflix gem....should be an Academy Awards Winner for best series or definitely an Emmy for best mini series...,9
North America,"I've seen quite a bit of chess movies and this one is by far the best. It combines the quirks of being a savant at a game and the underlying issues that come along with it. Generally the game of championship chess is extremely boring as it usually takes 2 hours a game, regularly 10-20mins/move. This movie speeds all that up yet keeps things grounded and interesting.The acting is really good and it has enough drama and tension besides chess. I definite must watch",9
North America,Watched it in 3 nights - kept getting better and better. Had no expectations and was an amazing surprise!,10
North America,"If you love Good movies. If you appretiate great acting, and cinematography, then don't skip this series.",9
North America,Truly mesmerizing show. One of the first unique things to hit Netflix in quite a while! I don't write reviews often but this one deserves it. Just watch it.,9
North America,"Honestly don't know what to say other than some shows are executed perfectly, and this is one of them. Not only is the story and the chess playing rich throughout the series, but everything is shot beautifully and matched with a fantastic score. The occasional flare of contemporary music gave the show character to match the lead role played by Anya. She plays this part flawlessly and owns every scene with her presence. The supporting cast is good as well, although none really stood out other than her adoptive mother.",10
North America,"Seven episodes that you wish would go on forever. Great writing, great direction and editing, the two actresses that portray the lead character at two stages of her life couldn't be more talented and engaging. This series and it's cast are going to sweep the Awards next season. I love chess but my wife doesn't play and she was as hooked as I was. We highly recommend it.",10
North America,"This was such a joy to watch. Tremendous performances by an excellent cast.The story moves carefully, thoughtfully, and deliberately. Yet there's a tension throughout. It's never predictable. Beneath it all is the backstory of the history of gender roles and underlying pervasive misogyny. Beth is forced to play the game in life and on the board.I loved every minute of it.On another level, I have to take note of the sheer unanimity of great reviews for this series. I don't think I've seen anything else that so unites everyone in the magnitude of appreciation. This is an achievement in and of itself in my book.",10
North America,"Netflix'S The Queens Gambit is the story of an orphaned girl who is a child prodigy chess player in a male dominated sport in the 60's... it is her coming of age between career and love and where she fits in the world, while she is haunted by the past and the people that try to touch her heart through the burden of her dreams of success.Anya Taylor - Joy's unique haunting looks and beautiful acting craft is just the beginning of great things to come",9
North America,The actors. The dialogue. The plot. Everything about this series is perfect. Anya Taylor-Joy is the only actress that could have pulled off this character.,10
North America,"Firstly, I was amazed by the imbd score! Unusual in itself, despite probably being by a self-filtering process as people who don't enjoy a more cerebral plot will just not watch this... But for those who are able to move past this self-elimination process, this is awesome viewing! For those that don't watch this series, a pity as this series cuts across so many socio-economic and political issues of the 20th century. Her children trauma started long before her parents died and she was put in an orphanage. It's the anti-social out workings in a society with strict defined gender roles that is fascinating to watch. I'm finding the series extremely compelling! Definitely recommended, whether it is your usual type of program or not!",10
North America,"Because you don't want to miss a moment. Sure, it has the typical hollywood stereotypes so popular now but still it's a beautiful story, and it's a nearly perfect production.",9
North America,One of the best netflix series the performances by the new Hollywood talents Anya Taylor joy masterful,9
North America,"Amidst so much recent mediocrity in a world gone crazy, Gambit is a relief desperately needed, smart, down-to-earth, mesmerizing, incredible acting, beautifully set, a music list that brings you back, an almost constant storm of human flaws colliding with human ingenuity.It's also a truly hilarious movie. The comedy can be subtle, but I found myself on multiple occasions bursting out in laughter at the delicate, cutting edge wit sprinkled in at the perfect time, and of course, who can stop watching in the middle of a series that incites so much raw emotional energy.In what is apparently a long and illustrious career of good works, Messr. Frank has outdone himself with this masterpiece.",10
North America,"The original novel by Tevis is by far the best chess story written, also for people as I who know little about the game. This adaption is just as amazing. The lead character is played with masterful grace and beauty. Everything about it is top shelf.",10
North America,"I just dreamed another life and woke up feeling elevated.
This quality miniseries delivers perfectly balanced experience to submerge into another world; world of chess, addiction, abandonment, balance, possibilities, grit, excellence, achievement and greatness. All that without dulling your mind with useless subplots and stealing your attention for month at a time with seeming infinite storytelling.",10
North America,One of the best things I've seen!! Fantastic entertainment. Made me want to get the Chess board out again!,10
North America,"I watched the series in a day, it was enchanting I couldn't stop watching. The cast is marvelous and the plot-line is fantastic. The actors portrayed the parts in the best way possible. The footage are astonishing. Highly recommended!",10
North America,"What an absolutely beautiful story this is.
Surprised me at every turn, with every episode just as wonderful as the next.
Ending of ep one had me laughing and hooked.
The main character Beth is a delight to watch throughout.",10
North America,"I just watched it, all 7 episodes, in just 2 days, 7 hours of incredible cinematography. The acting of the main protagonist (Beth) is captivating. The plot and cinematography are pure magic. Definately will go straight to awards. The best thing I have watched for maaany years. Mesmerising. I wished there was another season.",10
North America,"But a bit afraid that the full score might look false and fake like those fake promotion reviews. This is such a fascinating viewing experience. The leading females of the child in the orphanage and the one who later grew up to be the young woman are both fantastic casting jobs, and they've proved to be excellent and perfect choices. Kudo to the production team's great achievement from the playwritters, director and everybody, all of them involved in this series.
The young actress has an unique facial features, sometimes looked a bit weird and abnormal, but the more you looked at her and her acting, she'd have gradually won you over and transformed into a rare beauty with so unique talent.
This is such a exquisite series and very exciting to watch.
Wholeheartedly recommended.",10
North America,"Not the type of show I would normally look to watch but I was captivated from the first minute to the last. One of the best shows I have watched in a long time. Acting, Directing, costume was superb. Don't miss out !!",10
North America,"Let me start saying that I'm the guy who always reads reviews but never writes them. This series, however, deserves recognition, from the beginning to the end of it.It has a great plot and every single character on the series are unique and well developed in their own way.I won't spoil anything. Queen's Gambit has seven episodes and what may be the greatest finale I have ever seen.",10
North America,"Cool stuff. Gothic architecture, Hotel jumping. Luxury cocktails. Whats not to like?",5
North America,"The visualisation, dialogue, characterisation, costumes and most of all storyline are flawless. Making me want to not stop watching what happens next is great and makes me think about it when not watching. There is a constant intrigue to main characters back story but also future. Can't wait to see what they do with this",10
North America,If you play chess you won't find any flaw in this mini-series,10
North America,"For all its stylish good looks, I found the story ponderous, repetitive and clichéd. The self destruct element of the heroine, in particular, seemed forced. The final episode was so painstakingly slow, I had to resort to the +10 sec button throughout. I know for sure, I missed nothing. Relieved to the finally see the credits roll. That said, the performances were good and the chess aspect, authentic and serious.",6
North America,"I just stumbled upon this show and it captured me. Made me bingewatch. I finished the series within 2 days. When I didn't watch, it, it made me think about it. Good script, loved the actors, great acting and beautiful cinematography! Don't miss this one!",10
North America,"I still don't understand the high rating, nor do I understand what this series was about? An alcoholic prodigy, one who has zero emotional quotient, with an equal absence of expression on her face? Did we really need another Kristen Stewart? There is just some chess lingo thrown here and there to make this look like a well researched chess series, it is not. It is a story about a spoiled orphan brat who loses everything because of her alcoholism, sleeps with a few men, and then try to use them for her own benefit. That's a good summary of this entire series. Oh, and there is a woman of certain ethnicity to make sure the series is inclusive of them, although I still wonder why we do not have same woman of certain ethnicity as the protagonist. Oh no, that would be outrageous right? And find there is the right amount of ""hate the Communists"" thrown in to make sure the series fits right in, although someone should remind the producers that USSR/Russia produced some of the best Chess players, ever.And dear Hollywood, it's kind of getting tired on hearing the same ""men are evil, don't listen to them"" over and over again in every series, movie, documentary. There is a dialogue here where Beth's mother tells her that men will come in her life who would mostly be incompetent telling her what to do, never listen to them. And what happens to Beth's mother with this excellent life choices? She commits suicide.I don't understand the high rating, have people stopped watching good movies, or are they being paid to provide a higher rating! Anyway, do not bother watching it, you can take my advice because I did so that you don't have to.",2
North America,"I don't really watch too many movies. Some I find are difficult to hold my attention. Occasionally good ones come along. When I saw the Netflix advertisements for Queen's Gambit, I thought I might enjoy it. After all, the young actress was rather captivating in The Split.Boy was I way off!First off, the production values were unlike anything I've ever seen made for TV. The 60s were vividly brought back to life, with dazzling colors that rivaled any feature film. There were lots of new faces in unconventional roles. Or maybe they were just faces i hadn't seen, but they were all quite good and interesting!Now let's get to what holds it all together and makes it work.The young actress' name is Anya Taylor-Joy. Remember that name. She is the new ""it"" girl. Her features are as striking as Jennifer Lawrence, or Julia Roberts when they first achieved stardom, but she's also got a hypnotic quality that you don't often see.. She is in practically every scene, and is what made this guy who has a hard time sitting thru a two hour movie watch a 7 episode mini series in two days! If that's not the sheer definition of star power, I don't know what is!However, if there was one thing I found a bit disturbing, was one character frequently called another character a racial slur as a term of endearment. Why include something like that? Still, I would say watch Queen's Gambit for a very well done mini series that centers around chess, has wonderful production values, great acting, and the magnetic Anya Taylor-Joy at the center of it. You won't be disappointed.",10
North America,"A Netflix Original limited series that boasts an exceptionally well told coming of age story, powerful themes involving overcoming addiction and an absolutely brilliant cast! Easily digestible for people without extensive chess knowledge and all the more satisfying for people with it. Highly recommend to everyone with a Netflix subscription. Happy Watching!",9
North America,"This is one of the best series I have ever watched. All characters had their flaws, but nothing got over-dramatic or even worse melodramatic, so that they all remained deeply human. Taylor-Joy was a revelation, but the whole cast was simply superb. No flying superheroes, no fire dragons, no murders, only brilliant acting. The only thing I regret is that this was a limited series.",10
North America,"Beautiful chess story, ever seen! and great actor anya taylor joy "" beth harmon"" 10/10",10
North America,This series will fascinate you. Watch and enjoy the beautiful and well writted story. Plus the really good acting by almost all of the characters.,10
North America,I watched this as I lay in bed with a cold and couldn't get enough and would watch it again. A great film with a damaged but strong young woman trying to make her way.,9
North America,"Queens gambit manages without usual tropes or the usual story telling tools. There is no villain, no quest to save the world, no big romance story about the one true love and even the topic of chess players sounds boring.
It is all the more wonderful how great this show turned out to be! It is simply a girls story and her obsession to become one of the greats when it comes to chess.What makes it work are the perfectly written and played characters. Every performance fits like a glove, every expression tells you so much and I genuinely felt tension in God damn chess games I couldnt even follow properly because of their pace and strategies.There isn't really much more to say, this show is near flawless in execution. Although admittedly the narrative felt a tiny bit unfocussed at times in the second half.",9
North America,"Definitely, the best series i have watched recently. If you like success stories, you should watch it. If you also like chess, you must watch it. Acting, cinematography, art directing and soundtracks, all are outstanding. I enjoyed every moment of it. Time flies when you are watching it and it ends just in the way it should be; such a warming end in cold Moscow, I can't think of a better ending. Final words;It is impossible not to be checkmated against the charming gazes of Anya Taylor Joy, such beautiful eyes.",9
North America,"There are no words. As simply as that!
Unbelievable, I am in absolute shock. Haven't felt like that since Forrest Gump.
What a story line, performances, scenery, an unspeakable greatest of the music.
A thousand times bravo!!!
Wish there will be more
Great job.
Well done!",10
North America,"This show is a master piece in acting and writing, It invigorated my love for chess and you can count me as a new Anya fan :)",10
North America,"I have never been a fan of Chess. I played it a few times as a kid never understanding the depth of it and when I started to understand the depth of it I lost interest.
It is simply not my kind of game.
With that said. This mini series about a young woman who as a girl starts playing chess down in the basement at a orphans school with the local janitor and her way into the world of chess is simply one of the better things I have ever had the luxury to watch.
I think what drew me into this mini series was that while it is focused a lot on the world of Chess, it is so much more. Her own personal journey through her early life from being a young girl to becoming a young woman and how to navigate a world where you have a troubled past was really well made and emotional.I honestly started thinking ""this has to be based on some real life person?"" but no, it is a fictional story. It is that well made. It is that convincing.If you want to see a well crafted Drama with good acting, a superb script, well made editing and everything you can think off.
Nothing is left behind even minor characters are given enough time that you actually get to *know* them, their personalities and so on. That is a luxury that we are not treated with all too often in tv shows or movies these days.Don't hesitate to give this one a chance. It just keeps on delivering all the way to the end.",9
North America,Loved watching this show - the score is amazing and I found the storytelling gripping. The characters were great! Overall great series!,10
North America,"The story is great, writing is great, the acting is really good, but I'm getting tired of being talked down to by American television.
For about 1/4 of each episode we get to see the characters playing... Something... Its probably chess, but we never see more than 1 or 2 actual moves in succession... I dont mean that the focus should always be a perfect full length chess game, but Please! Let us see some of it at the bottom of the screen? I'm not even a good chess player, but I thought this series about a Chess player might contain a game of chess? Maybe I'm just too nerdy to enjoy American television...",7
North America,Running out of good series to watch in the evening and happened upon this. Gotta hand it to Netflix!Cast is wonderful and direction is superb! Cinematography is far beyond what I was expecting.. and the storyline appeals to pretty much anyone with a pulse.,10
North America,This is another excellent work that has been added to Netflix limited series. It's that kind of TV show that makes you regain trust in Netflix again.,9
North America,"The Queen's Gambit is simply a masterpiece in every aspect of filmmaking. Absolute brilliant acting, direction, editing, production design, costuming, makeup/hair design, cinematography, and a killer soundtrack. It's an unforgettable series in a time of high expectations from all of us. As I write this the IMDB rating is 8.9 from nearly 10,000 reviewers. How can that many of us be wrong?",10
North America,This Queen will take you along with her journey and you will be left with an awe and warmth in your heart.The Queen's Gambit was much needed for this 2020.Loved every moment of the series.,10
North America,"This series has been something I have been looking forward to for a month or so. When I heard that Bill Camp and Thomas Brodie-Sangster would appear, I was overcome with excitement. I was actually very excited when I heard that Scott Frank created, directed and wrote the majority of the show. I love his work, particularly Logan and Godless. Now, let's talk about why Queen's Gambit is so amazing.Anya Taylor-Joy portrays a complex chess player by the name of Elizabeth ""Beth"" Harmon. By the very definition of a story, there must be a protagonist and there must be a central conflict or antagonist. I have never quite watched a show where the protagonist is also the antagonist. Beth develops addictions to pills, alcohol and several other narcotics as a way to distract herself from her life or enhance her performance playing chess.Most people will probably talk about her pills or her chess prowess in reviews, but that is not the main theme of the series. As we go through life, we are exposed to our parents, mentors, friends and, one day, lovers. This is the same journey that Beth goes through in the series. She changes as a person and her chess techniques become more advanced as her relationships morph who she is. Humans do not progress or change without the relationships we have with others.What was magical about this miniseries format was that it answers all of the key questions that we, as a viewer, can have. The finale is a fine work of art. I loved that almost every character that changed Beth was in the finale. Every aspect of her life culminates at the World Chess Championship in Moscow. This pivotal moment has been her life's work and everyone from her life is there for her biggest moment. I absolutely love this sentiment and bringing these characters back wraps every plot line in a nice little bow.The writing was phenomenal, but so was the acting. Anya Taylor-Joy, Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Bill Camp, Harry Melling and newcomer Moses Ingram elevated the script and their scenes. I think it is unfortunate that there is not more TV with a complex female protagonist. There are far too many series where there is not enough of a female presence. I loved that this series talked about key issues in our society through the lens of the 1960s. Chess, after all, is a male dominated world and I smiled each time she caused men to shake their heads or become emotional from her merciless tactics. Men always seemed to underestimate her and I loved each time she proved herself as a superior player.Well, I hope that this review was enlightening. I intentionally did not give away specific plot lines because I want the person reading this review to experience the series for themselves. I do highly recommend the series, I thought it was completely original and I hope that certain ideas the show demonstrated in certain scenes will continue through other projects or mediums. Please watch the show, you will not be disappointed!",9
North America,"There's already enough reviews here, but this show is so good I have to say something anyway. I already somewhat liked chess going into this, but this show made it unbelievably exciting.
Of course, the show isn't really about chess, so much as it uses the game as a plot device to show the growth and development of Beth from a young kid to a famous adult, while exploring all the pain and trouble that comes from being an orphan, being exposed to drugs at a young age, being exposed to fame at a young age, etc.
Some people say they dragged the show out longer than it had to be, but I disagree. I think the added experiences makes the series more satisfying, and I, personally, never found it boring. The cinamatography and costume and set design made sure of that.
Overall, I'd call this a must watch and am already recommending it to everyone I know.",10
North America,"Anya Taylor Joy is going to be around in a big way for a long time. She has what it takes (and not just because she has the biggest eyes since Audrey Hepburn). Her acting range is phenomenal. The story, of course, is complete fiction, as it never happened, but the production values are so good, and the writing is so realistic, that we lose ourselves in the fiction. Actually, only those who lived through the Bobby Fischer era would know right away that this is strictly fiction. Most younger people would probably buy the whole premise. Regardless, ITS A MOVIE, folks; it doesn't matter if its real or not. It only matters that it is really well done, and this one is. Don't miss it.",7
North America,"This is by far the best show to come out of Netflix in the Covid-19 era, yet they were so humble about it. With practically no promos or A-list actors, a master piece was born. Great plot, great acting, lovely rendition of the 60s and you don't even have to like chess to enjoy this.",10
North America,"What an excellent show and a total surprise. The artistry, the settings, the dress, the capture of the time period is an accomplishment in itself. And a great plot, great acting and storyline/plot development, really wonderful.Highly recommended, best show I've seen in quite a while...",10
North America,"Although I enjoy great movies/series and good books, I usually find myself distracted by work or social media whilst watching or reading. It can be annoying, but I generally tend to disregard it, as I feel like I can keep focus in both places simultaneously.
However, I just finished episode 3, and I have not yet been distracted by anything - my focus is strictly on the show, because it is really intriguing to me. I love the main character's odd persona with the intuitive, striking intelligence that just puts her on a completely other level than the other kids (and also, it is very rare to see good child actors, as we saw in E1). The 60's in America is also just an interesting time to observe in film-making, as there are so many political and sociological questions, of which some can easily be perspectivated to today's society - and I feel like the series does this in a very nice way, neither too much nor too little.
I haven't read the book, so I can't say how good the series is in comparison, but I am very, very impressed so far, and I will likely be giving a 9 or 10 star rating when I'm finished with the whole series.
If you're considering watching this, you should most definitely do it. In these boring times, great stuff like this makes me really happy.",10
North America,"A very good production indeed.Anya Taylor-Joy, who is splendid in this role, plays a genuine girl with an astounding talent, but several flaws: this makes up a realistic character which you will likely empathize with, while watching her emotional story. The performances of the other main actors are convincing too.The technical aspects, except for the CGI, serve perfectly to the miniseries, and I particularly appreciated the editing and the soundtrack. A special mention also to the costumes.Obviously it is not free from defects (besides the CGI, the main one is that some characters and some sequences are quite trivial), but they are minor, so that overall I truly liked this product.
And, let me reapeat it, how good and fascinating Anya Taylor-Joy is.",9
North America,"Make sure to cancel your weekend plans. Binge watch alert.
One of the best series I have ever seen - on all levels of production: great cast all the way around, beautiful cinematography, wardrobe, music score and an engaging and addictive script!",10
North America,"First of all. I can't get enough of Anyas expressive face. She's amazing.
But also the storyline, script , acting, everything! This is a fantastic story to be seen!",10
North America,"Phenomenal show. The writing, the acting and the story. When you get the perfect balance of all 3 what you get is a gem.",10
North America,"When I found out that this was taken from a Walter Tevis novel, I had to see it.
He's the same guy that wrote the novel that they based ""The Hustler"" on, and there are many similarities between the two books/movies.
They both take place in roughly the same time period 1950s-60s, and feature someone who is the best at what discipline they are involved in.
However, both have character flaws that get in the way of them advancing to the top of their craft, which they ultimately overcome through force of will.
There is one seemingly unbeatable master of that craft that they have to work their way up to finally facing, and they both fail at first, but eventually triumph in the end.
Both films had fine directing, acting, music (the great jazz composer Kenyon Hopkins for the Hustler) and cinematography, but IMHO the B&W grittiness, along with the jazz score of The Hustler are superior to the slick look and source music of The Queen's Gambit.",10
North America,"I had no expectations for this show and thought being about chess it would be pedestrian or boring. I couldn't have been more wrong. I think it's one of the most accomplished pieces of television I have seen in years. The costume and production design is incredible. Each frame is like a piece of art. The music is perfect, as is the writing. Every scene is well-paced, acted and directed and stylistically unique each episode, yet cohesive throughout. Bravo! Recommend to all ?",10
North America,This is and will be one of the best series I ever watched. Just one word of advice before you start watching it....make sure you have kept the next 7 hours free because there's no way you can stop watching it.,10
North America,"I was hooked even from watching the preview that Netflix provides when you hover on a title. The description of the show doesn't sound like an interesting premise, but the acting, plot, and direction will keep you fully entertained. I highly recommend this series!",10
North America,"A wonderful story with fully formed characters, a story that rolls along with few bumps and a beautiful ending. Excellent.",9
North America,"Wow! Who knew chess would be so exciting? We may get a chess set! This show is really good. It's very fun and thrilling, which is very strange because it's chess. It's also very emotional and touching. We like the janitor and the adoptive mom. It's really a great show. Certainly a must watch! You're in for a good time. We really give it a 10!",10
North America,"Well producer , well acting , best of the best.
A trully masterpiece . 10/10 .
????????????",10
North America,"I had no idea what this series was about before I watched it. Even though the poster shows some chess pieces, I thought it was only used for some symbolic reason like she's a master manipulator of people. To my surprise, it really was about chess. The acting, directing, & production were all top notch for the budget, but then there were some things that really shined for me. I liked that it did not try desperately to make you feel sorry for the main character, even though she was an orphan up against some heavy odds. Some scenes were so touching and well done because it just revealed itself to you, instead of trying so hard to make you feel something - it was in a word, ""beautiful"". The portrayal of all the characters in her life was also something worth recognizing because they were not made to be stereotypical characters of parents, men, teachers, opponents - instead they actually seemed normal and not taken to the extreme, like the men are all salacious pigs, the teachers are all mean, and the step parents are evil. And, last, I would just like to say, Anya Taylor Joy looks amazing in1960's make up and clothes - especially in that last scene when she wears all white, sitting in the back of the limo - ""what is this thing of beauty?"" - she's absolutely stunning.",9
North America,"Awesome, could not stop watching. Great story and great acting. Loved the human interactions and morels",10
North America,"If I had to watch this again I'd lose my mind. This was such a slow moving movie that tried way too hard to be something much deeper than it really is. Run, run as fast as you can away from this series.",3
North America,"This was such a well played out and told story from start to finish. Very well done. It was mostly clean and shows how just a great story can be done. Highly recommended. My 9 instead of 10 is just the small things that I did not like, such as a couple of brief sex scenes and two possible LGBQ moments. But, I can tell you I have recommended this show to many people.",9
North America,This short series kept me quite captivated. I ended up watching it all within 2 days. I appreciated Beth's struggles and hard work to achieve her success. It was more realistic this way.,10
North America,"First off, I'm a huge chess buff. The idea of a chess show got me all tingly inside just like when I watched Searching for Bobby Fischer as a child.However my gripe with this show is not that it's a coming to age story but the sexualized nature of a child from the hands of older men. Since her first tournament, there is an older man eyeing her inappropriately. She later sees him in Las Vegas and he's still pursuing her and gets her to his hotel room. She's a minor and he's old! She left and nothing happened.Later on, the main character has her first sexual experience with a person who is taking night college courses (I believe she's currently in high school) and whom she just met the same night. She's a minor.What's even more strange is her mother knows she's partying with college students that night and said ""okay"", I'll see you in the morning. This is the same mother who said she had aspirations that were pushed aside because she became pregnant. Additionally, she told the main character she will try harder as a mother. Yet throughout the film, she allows her minor daughter to drink and hang out with much older ambiguous men.",5
North America,"A must see!
Great acting, thick plot, depth in characters, 10/10.
I had a long time to watch such a marvellous series!
Thank you Netflix!",10
North America,"I've been a fan of Anya Taylor-Joy for several years and it never came to my mind that she could do something so wonderful outside of the horror genre. She is not only beautiful and quirky, but very classy and ladylike. Not often can I say that about other actresses of her generation, but this girl absolutely rocks. I really hope she gets many awards for her performance. This TV series gets a solid 10 out of 10 from me.",10
North America,I never thought that watching someone playing chess can be so captivating.,10
North America,"If you read reviews on IMDB you, no doubt, have come across the statement ""I usually don't write reviews but..."" I understand when someone uses that phrase but I find it used far too much. So it pains me to say I am one of those people. I usually don't write reviews but...this is one of the finest series I have ever watched. Quite a stout statement. Never mind that the cinematography, music and costuming are flawless, but the storyline is riveting. What's so riveting about a chess phenom series? Watch. Anya Taylor-Joy is astounding in the role. The way the film is constructed, how it pulls you along is fantastic. Watching a child genius discover her gift, and others reaction to it was a joy to watch. The fierce competition, friendships and heartache put you into the world you are watching. There are a handful of shows that are just about perfect. This is one of them. After all, if a program entertains you to no end it's done what it's supposed to do. Checkmate.",10
North America,"I was absolutely blown away by this Netflix miniseries. They could not have picked a better actress than Anya Taylor-Joy to play the role of chess prodigy Beth Harmon, Taylor-Joy's acting is mesmerizing, hypnotic, & she brings amazing depth to this series. I also noticed that during her games she was playing fast & accurately, which tells me she must have really studied up on the game to play her part. I tried to pace myself & watch one episode per day, but I ended up binge watching it over a period of two days. Very addictive.",10
North America,I just finished this series in 2 days. The best show I've seen in years. Do yourself a favor and savor this show like a fine wine.,10
North America,A must watch. Something different from the usual. Very well structured.,9
North America,"Been following Anya Taylor since The witch.i can say this is the best show in 2020, the acting, scoring, script, costume, everything is pperfect..
thank you netflix. keep climbing Anya!!",10
North America,"The show is awesome!! We need more shows and movies with the depth, intelligence, character, and story telling like The Queens Gambit, instead of half baked remakes and sequels... if you're looking for an emotional story about a woman succeeding in a man's world, without the liberal propaganda of today being pushed in your face, watch this show! I finished it in one day and wanted more!Take notes Hollywood... less Witches (2020) and more Gambit!!!",10
North America,"I thought the first few episodes were really enticing: A young girl discovering an escape from her life as an orphan through chess. It was something different compared to what's out there at the moment, the unique concept had me hooked, but the more the series went on it fell a bit flat for me. It turned into a ""teen girl coming of age, meeting different blokes every 5 minutes and sleeping with them"" kind of story, made me lose interest a bit. It picked up again towards the end though.The acting was good for the most part, Anya Taylor-Joy does well in her role. The cinematography was brilliant, that's where I thought this series excelled; it had some really beautiful shots throughout that help keep you immersed in Beth's world. It's watchable, very visually appealing, but like most Netflix series it just gets drawn out too much. Would have worked better as a film imo.",6
North America,"Definetly the best netflix original serie of all time. Intense, dramatic, fun... and it's about chess?",10
North America,"It's been a while since I've found one like this. Charming, layered, obvious, unexpected......a cinematographic game of chess.
Everything about it is perfect.",10
North America,A brilliant performance by anya taylor. It was a great show and deserves all the praise.,10
North America,"Simply the best Netflix show this year, set in late 60s early 70s, show casing this era to perfection, the costumes and the set were a site to behold. The series got better with each episode,original storyline, quirky humour, tinged with sadness, and great joy all wrapped up with the flawless performance of the most gorgeous Anya Taylor-Joy, She totally owned this role from tip to toe.I dont expect any other actress could have come near her performance.
The author must have been ecstatic to see her become Beth Harmon.
Of course I binge watched the first half, then slowed down once I realised there were only 7 episodes.. A rare watch again, again , masterpiece.",10
North America,"Beautifully written, well executed story of a girl in the 1960s that fights against marginalisation with the pure power of her brain!Brilliant acting, great cinematography!",10
North America,"What an amazing story. I never dreamt that an exciting series could be built around the game of chess. The main actress deserves an Oscar award. My only dislike was the crude language in the first scenes. Otherwise, this story would have been a great inspiration to children.",10
North America,"The Queen's Gambit is hands down one of the best miniseries of the year and one of the best overall series of 2020. Period. It had me hooked from the first episode all the way to the last one. Very early on in the show, it becomes clear a lot of effort and heart was poured into it, ranging from the writers, to the actors, to the directors and editors.It starts us off with a killer pilot. It opens with what is presumably the show's present day, only to go back to the character's upbringings. Although the backstory may appear cliché in the surface-a misunderstood, socially awkward orphaned girl growing up in a hostile Christian orphanage-the writing is so tender and intimate, it comes off as genuine and moving rather than manipulative and cheap.For the rest of the episodes the series doesn't lose any steam. It charges on, delivering solid emotional hits in the process and nail-bitting moments of tension and drama.The characters were phenomenally fleshed out. Every single one of them felt real. The social commentary wasn't just thrown in there in order to score woke points. It was subtle, effective, and, most importantly, relevant to the story and atmosphere. The performances were all great. Anya Taylor-Joy was, as usual, excellent. All the child actors were up to the standards as well. And the whole thing was just incredibly poignant.Really impressed with The Queen's Gambit. My one and only quibble with the show was the last episode. The final outcome was great, but few parts of the episode felt a bit too over-the-top and Hollywood for me. It sticks out a bit when the rest of the series is so grounded. Nevertheless, it really is a very minor flaw. This was a project crafted with a lot of care and dedication, and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for high quality TV.",9
North America,"Great story, no need to know anything about chess.",9
North America,"I didn't know it was possible to make chess exciting, interesting, sexy and playful. I absolutely fell in love with the lead actress! The characters are well written and I love the story. I haven't been as excited about a serie since Chernobyl aired! A must watch and binge worthy :)",10
North America,"Seriously i started looking at 11 in the evening, i watched it all. Couldnt sleep after i watched.Today again watched some episodes, still gave me the same feelings when i watched yesterday evening i was again amazed!First review ever i had to leave one!",10
North America,To see an rj11 or 45 phone jack on a phone on a quality production like this is like seeing one of the actors use a mobile phone. Its so disappointing when you are really absorbed and enjoying every minute. It happens so often now in so many 60's and 70's based movies and it literally spoils the whole experience.,5
North America,I just loved this and finished it in two days.. such a delight to binge and was sad when it was over... a must see!!!,10
North America,"The Queen's Gambit was extraordinary, ingenious, there no superlatives adequate enough to describe it.l started watching without any expectations but from the opening few minutes of the first episode, was more than enough to keep me riveted.
And it just kept getting better and unlike many final episodes, this was exquisitely crafted and executed.Easily the best finale to a series that l've ever watched.
The character development for even the minor characters were exceptional,
the direction was so considerate that you couldn't help but form an emotional connection with all of them.The last eprisode was so well done that it almost felt like an end to a show with several seasons rather than a limited series.The Queens Gambit additionally had some very good messages sprinkled in
between, they were subtle and doesn't make you feel like an agenda was being forced on you.Acting was sublime. Cinematography too was supreme with some very
impressive scene transitions. The score was spectacular and provided the perfect accompaniment to this show.I can't express enough how flawless and thoroughly enjoyable this series is.The journey was easily one of the most exquisite entertainment experiences of my life.I rate The Queens Gambit 200/10",10
North America,"THE QUEEN'S GAMBITThe person who has lost everything, has nothing to lose.Who would have thought that a Netflix coming of age TV series about a 1950s chess player would be so eventful and delightful.Beautiful period cinematography combines with a deft penned script to deliver one of the best human drama and inspirational series of covid-19.A lilting piano with orchestral soundtrack supports imbues an ""Alice in wonderland"" narrative sense, as a young girl takes on men in a male dominated intellectual sport during an age of chauvinism.As the girl ages, the soundtrack evolves through beautifully composed period music, which becomes more upbeat as the series and the age progresses. This is so well integrated into the story that the music itself becomes the real storyteller. You will probably want to get your hands on the soundtrack.The main character loses her parents very early in life, is orphaned and learns to become an independent thinker. Which provides us with a sense of the resilience and self reliance that is required to become successful at life and relationships.Her birth mother is highly intelligent with a bright mind at mathematics. We see very little of those sorrowful beginnings, and learn from this to not get caught up in our losses, but to focus on the using the good memories to move us forward to our happy nirvana.Our chess player has a capacity for lucid dreaming and can visualise three dimensional chest board model's with her imagination. This ability is simply and beautifully captured through some well placed CGI.The side story of the series is the relationship being formed with stepmother, conveying a sense of girl power and 'revenge through success' in a manner that is both charming and poignant to our times.As we look back to how a mother and daughter navigate their way through to their mutual independence, triumphant through their loss, we are each supported by the narrative to introspection and self reflection.There is a beautiful moment in which the main character wears her mothers night gown to feel closer to her. Anyone who has lost someone will find deep meaning and a sense of seeing themselves in the story, due to use of visual metaphors that make the emotion of the script immediately accessible.One asks,""Who am I in the context of this story?""We are each on a path to exploring new versions and reinventions of self, as we adapt to growing older and wiser in our relationship with self and others.Do what you love.
With who you love.
Make your move.GJM",10
North America,One of the best mini-series I have seen. Every episode gets better.,10
North America,"I am not sure that I am going to be able to articulate how this series impacted me, because it hits at so many levels that I am still sorting it out. You take in sumptuous beauty and callous ugliness; aching loyalty and heartbreaking betrayal; glorious hope and grueling despair. The last chess scene, when, clean of all drugs and alcohol, Beth gathers it all in, gazes upward to her intellect's creation of a gorgeous chessboard, and reaches beyond her grasp was overwhelming. All of the acting (but, wow, Anya!), the cinematography, screenplay, music, and costumes are works of art. Do not miss this.",10
North America,"Great story, great acting, great cinematography, great directing, great everything! What more do you want?!
One of the best mini-series I've ever watched. Thank you.",10
North America,The Queen's Gambit is amongst the best series from Netflix. It is engaging and gripping. The Chess game and the representation of the geniuses who are involved in this mastermind game. I loved the series. The lead is best in her performance and all the cast performed a fine play.,10
North America,"I rarely say this, but i find it hard to find anything bad to say about this show.
You clearly do not need to know anything about chess to see this show, as you never really see a full game played.
It plays on emotion's, rather then the games it self.
I guess that in it self can be a let down to some, because the few times you think your following a game, the pieces on the board is flying randomly around, or so it seems.Then ending was sudden, but good. They set you up for more, but does not deliver. I guess have questions left for my imagination.Netflix have been disappointing again and again with shows from season 2.
But these limit series, especially this one are spot on and i could not recommend anything more.",9
North America,This is an excellent short series. Fantastic and the acting is incredible.,10
North America,"In fifty years of watching television, this is some of the best drama I've ever seen. Yes, it's that good. Anya Taylor Joy is mesmerising. The series tells a passionate , sensitive , moving and faultless story.",10
North America,"Wasn't sure this was gonna be my thing, however, 7 episodes later I was praying for more... watched all the episodes in one day and was gripped from start to finish. The writing and acting was sublime
This is a must watch movie that you can't miss, but start early, it's like a good book you can't put down...
Credit to Netflix for raising the bar again!!",9
North America,I am a chess lover myself. Fantastic tv series!! Brilliant acting!! Leaves some strong messages & impact!! Every episode is worth watching!,10
North America,This is a nice story. The only problem I have with the production is how dark and dingy the filming is. It seems to be a trend these days along with the horrible music that we have to suffer with. Are movie sets trying to save money on lighting equipment these days? Even the outdoor scenes are dark and gloomy. Is that part of the theme? It doesn't work for me.,8
North America,Unexpected and excellent. Would love to see more shows like this. Had to binge watch the entire series after watching the first episode. Watch it - you'll love it!,10
North America,"Never have I been so blown away by a series I randomly stumbled upon. It is so well written, great transitions/editing and marvelous acting. Even though its a 7 episode show, I feel like I have been through a great story with multiple plot-lines all tying up at the end in one masterpiece of an episode.
The perfect balance between mysterious and exciting storytelling. A must watch in my book if you like miniseries! 10/10!",10
North America,"What a wonderful storyline brought to life with beautiful cinematography, reminiscent music, and exceptional acting. This series deserves its rating in every way... It is exactly what a Netflix series needs to be. I thoroughly enjoyed it!",10
North America,"Its just like a black hole once u watch the first 5 mins u feel i cant get away without watching the whole series, acting was exceptional so as every thing . it wasn't like a slow drama more than blink it and u will miss it, its full of emotions and messages, and most importantly no political agenda behind it.
recommend it strongly to everyone",10
North America,"It's Halloween, and it's October, and I don't want to watch anything other than horror movies, but I got sucked into this show because my God it's good. I mean it's really really Good. It's so well done. You really care for the characters and it's such an amazing story.",10
North America,"Such a great mini series.
Nothing to complain about.",10
North America,I'm at episode 3 and it's very nicely paced with a great score that keeps it moving along quite nicely. Well acted and quite gripping so far.,9
North America,"I have never played a single game of chess in my life, yet I cancelled a night out with friends to sit in the darkness of my room to watch all 7 episodes back to back in one sitting. This was only after watching the first 20 minutes of episode 1, because I had a feeling in my heart that I was about to witness something special. How right I was!Firstly, the soundtrack! God, the music was the perfect addition to how ""on the edge of my seat"" I felt the entire time. The soaring strings, occasional double bass and delicate piano melodies was the perfect backdrop to all the drama and Intrigue peppered throughout the series. It made my heart soar when Beth had her first victory, I had sweaty palms when you could feel the tension in her games, and when she cried, I did too. Bravo to Carlos Rivera who put together a beautiful collection of melodies!Secondly, the acting. Of course, we have to start with Anya. I have followed her acting journey from some time now, when I first saw her in the ""witch"" and this has definitely got to be her best role yet. I had to pinch myself a few times to remind myself I wasn't actually in the world she inhabited during the sixties, travelling around the world and playing against all the men. Her acting was so natural, yet nuanced, it almost made me feel uncomfortable as if I was peering into a side of her soul she didn't want to be seen. And my god, those EYES. In a series where almost all the interactions involved body language and speaking through actions rather than words, Anya was the perfect choice. I would be very surprised if she didn't get nominated, or win the Emmy. She deserves it.Of course, the story shines with the additional help of the other characters. In particular, Thomas Brodie Sangster as Benny Watts made me laugh, swoon, and rage at his often cocky yet loving personality. His and Anyas chemistry was electric. Alma, as her mother also deserves a special mention. She played the role of a neglected housewife wanting to break free from her mundane life, so well!I have watched this miniseries two times over the last three days and I STILL cannot get it out of my head. That is truly the mark of great filmmaking I think. That, and the fact I had continual goosebumps throughout the last episode. (That final game with Borgov though! Ahhh) and I have recommended this series to everyone I know. Watch it, you won't regret it.Ok, I'm off to watch it for the third time now!",10
North America,"I was hooked on binging this Netflix mini-series, ""The Queen's Gambit,"" at the end of the second episode, when Beth Harmon's (Anya Taylor-Joy) adoptive mother (Marielle Heller) begins supporting her daughter's playing in chess tournaments. With the colorful 1950s-1960s settings, it became like a less-moody ""Mad Men"" romp across the country and, then, the world. Socio-political issues of the times are sometimes superficially addressed and there's the drug-addiction throughline, but none of it, fortunately, is treated too melodramatically. What I especially came to appreciate about the show, however, is some of the ways it treats its protagonist's gifted mind.Sure, there's the usual trope of genius bordering on madness and the mommy and daddy issues, and she's naturally exceptional. But, Harmon also reads a lot, and we see her reading. She studies and plans her moves away from the board, and we see her doing that. Heck, it's a game where players take notes during professional matches. She learns from talking over the game with experts and friends. She's passionate and intellectually curious; that's what led her to learn chess from a janitor in the first place. It's what led her to take classes to learn Russian. To compare ""The Queen's Gambit"" to another picture of a troubled savant emerging from custodial work, we don't merely see Harmon doodling nonsense equations on a mirror or chalkboard as in ""Good Will Hunting"" (1997) and speed reading books at night only to spend days employing that knowledge to humiliate antagonists in between performing manual labor and drinking with buddies. It surely helps, too, that ""The Queen's Gambit"" is adapted from a book and that they hired a grandmaster to design the chess moves. Taylor-Joy, reportedly, related the chess matches to her experience with dance, and there's indeed a rhythm to these scenes that works even for someone like me who doesn't play chess.",7
North America,"Ana Taylor-Joy is simply mesmerizing. If anyone did not recognize this young English actress before, they will after watching this superb limited-run series. Great things lie ahead for her, and for her audience.The direction of this show stood out for me. The director made chess exciting, imparting just enough knowledge to appreciate the game at the highest level. The special effects were a perfect device for showing how an world-class player thinks so many moves ahead. Overall the look was gorgeous, the pacing spot on, the tension perfect.Well done Netflix . This makes up for those boring warrior Princess shows. Now get this production team another project ASAP..Now, back to figuring out what to watch.",10
North America,"Beautifully written, beautifully shot, beautifully paced and beautifully powerful. In Anya Taylor-Joy a powerhouse of acting prowess is born. I knew of her from appearances in Shyamalans long awaited flops, but this will make her a household name. What a performance. Delivers the deeply flawed side of Beth flawlessly while bringing a class and style not seen in a long time. This has adverse childhood experience, troubled youth, chess, Cold War, communism, addiction, greed, jealousy tenderness. A must watch!!",10
North America,"I went into watching this show without any expectations as I knew nothing about chess or its rules. But after watching first 2 episodes, I had an urge to learn everything about chess. The acting is great and the story is so captivating throughout. So really this show makes you wanna learn and play chess even if you know nothing about it! Highly recommended from my side.",9
North America,"Haven't seen such a good movie since years!
Wow!!!
Mind blowing!",10
North America,"This is such a compelling show about the game of chess, checked out first episode and before I knew it I was on episode 4, the next day I had to buy a chess set cause I forgot how much I love to play",10
North America,"Everything about this series is perfect. Plot, character development, the score, love it.",10
North America,"Superb acting and good atmosphere of the 60's.
I think many poeple will discover what chess competion is.
It is of the same quality as Minhunters .
Don't miss this show !",10
North America,The series is so well directed. The storyline was very intriguing yet smooth to watch. It's such a delight to watch something with a new concept. This show empowers women while making you fall in love with chess gradually. Definitely a binge worthy show.,10
North America,This series was amazing from start to finish! Totally watching it again and will buy if I can??????,10
North America,You don't have to know or like chest to love this movie! Loved it the whole way through!!,10
North America,"...and likely the best Netflix mini-series ever. Everything from the acting, cinematography, score, etc. were phenomenal. The character development for a 7-episode series was unparalleled. I felt like I knew each of them and how it all came full circle was uncanny. Anya Taylor-Joy was at her best, but the supporting actors/actresses were also incredible. I started this series half-heartedly, something more for background noise, but came out as one of my favorite series of all time. It was truly enticing, heartbreaking, and inspiring. It is an absolute must watch.",10
North America,"One of the best Drama tv series I have seen in a very long time, if not ever. Definitely recommended.",10
North America,"TLDR: The story is riddled with good intentions and interesting character development, but truly lacking in ways that would make this actually a feminist story featuring a rare truly brilliant and strong female lead.I found this show quite engaging to watch (especially because I initially thought it was true), but by the end, I felt despite the complexity of the lead character, everything was too tidy and wrapped up, and very clearly written from the male's perspective (it was a male author of the book after all).The main character, Beth, is wonderfully acted by both the young and the adult actresses, but as her character ages, her complexity weakens, and she becomes the traditional trope of a woman in need of a man to truly feel worth by the end.Please do not keep reading if you don't care for very mild spoilers.We see Beth pine over a much older man that tries to sleep with her in a Las Vegas hotel room when she is just 15-16, whom she eventually ends up with. The hotel room scene was one that bordered on grooming a young lady after seeing her blossoming sexuality, and felt uncomfortable. Yet by the end we're supposed to buy this as a true connection? And the reason she's able to believe in herself and push through to success? Could a female character this brilliant not ever have done this on her own?!Also in the end, she can only find her true success by working with others. A seemingly great message, but why are ALL of the others she works with male? All the other female characters in this story are portrayed as little poos. There's the french girl who goads Beth into a bad situation, her mother who is a drunk and an addict who enables Beth... and then there's the sole other female chess player who Beth completely treats like a blip on the radar (which somehow she NEVER does to a single man in the entire storyline, not even a 13 year old).By the end, everything is to clean and tidy, when Beth's whole life to that point was anything but. Everything is wrapped with a pretty pink bow. There are no questions left unanswered. There is nothing unbelievable. It's generic and predictable.Overall, it is a fun show and worth a watch. But at the end of the day, it is, but yet again, a ""strong female"" story written through the lens of a man.",8
North America,"This show definitely surprised me how good it was. With the perfect mix of tragedy, downward spiral, while at the same time successfully bring a smile to my face. The cinematography also made what can seem like a very boring game to watch to some into one that kept me at the edge of my seat. This show really felt perfect. So much so that I think a second season would ruin the beauty of this show. Though if there was one, I would definitely watch it.",10
North America,"Compelling from the start! Well acted, beautifully shot and well written. So worth the time.",9
North America,"No inflated ratings here. The series is perfect in every way. Sometimes a rare show or movie comes a long where you just want to savor every second of it, and when it is over you feel bad that you watched it as you wish you could see it all over again fresh.It really does not even matter if you care about chess or even understand it. Chess is an old and esteemed game but the club is rather small . I just have a cursory understanding of the game myself from very casual play as a child, where one learns how the pieces move and you play with other kids with no strategy at all.The series production takes a very interesting approach to the actual ""chess"" action. In all, there's really not much direct chess action, but almost every game is choreographed differently, from the setting and music to the surrounding atmosphere or ""goings on"". To point, during the key games you see more of what's going on around the game than the game itself. It's like the director knew that most folks don't want to watch a show about people moving chess pieces across a board. Yet, all the suspense and drama is captured perfectly and it is fascinating.Mostly though, 'Queen's Gambit' is a human story. A coming of age drama about a girl coming from a difficult background, who just happens to be a genius and a prodigy. It's this development and progression from an early age, and the struggles along the way, that really captures your heart. All played wonderfully by a beautiful and talented up-and-coming (or has she arrived) actress in Taylor-Joy. I was already familiar with Joy from movies like ""The Witch"" , ""Split"", and some smaller stuff, but I think this is the work that will skyrocket her. The supporting cast also does an excellent job here, but this is Taylor-Joy all the way and she rocks it.Overall, this series is very uplifting. It touches on some darker subjects related to her childhood and addictions but, in my opinion, never enters truly melodramatic territory. And I think that works well here. The ending is fantastic....and yet very down to earth.Do not hesitate....watch. I can't recommend this enough. Best thing I've seen on the small screen in a long time, and I'd go so far to say that this is the best Netflix Original to date.",10
North America,"A remarkable tale of a female's journey from childhood to young adulthood. Set in the 50's/60's era, it captures so many aspects of this thing called ""life"". A ""queen"" emerges from dust, cardboard and a few plastic pieces worthy of royal titles. Brilliant!!",10
North America,"Finished in a day, bunch watching till 6pm :) The show is the best series everrr. I must say its one-of-a-kind. Combining a bunch of things from addition, winning obbsession and even fashion. The cinematography: just one word ""excellent"". Anya Taylor-Joy (Beth aka chi yeu) is superb in the lead and i cant keep my eyes off on her. Go go and get #1 netflix vietnam pls u deserve it.",10
North America,"You should watch this show!! Its story is captivating, acting was superb, amazing ending, netflix made it right this time!!",10
North America,"Just finished watching The Queen's Gambit on Netflix and it was nothing short of amazing and without any of the useless trendy trash in there. Just a beautiful, well presented mini series that was realistic but with a certain cinematic nostalgia to it for that hint of warmth. It highlighted on darker issues of the mind with the softest touch of a feather.
A Goodwill Hunting/Beautiful Mind meets Anne of Green Gables with a sprinkle of Eurofilm edge. An accomplished, beautiful watch.",9
North America,Well written and performed. Reminded me of stories my mom told in the orphanage she grew up in,10
North America,This was one of the best shows ever made! At the end of the last match I got chills up my arms. Anya Taylor-Joy absolutely crushed this role! She left me speechless with how marvelous she was in this show.,10
North America,"I have no interest in Chess but I recognized the girl so I figured I would check it out and ended up watching the entire thing in one sitting. I wish it was based on a true story. My only complaint was the drug use, not all of the drug use in the show, just one specific drug and the reason that made it an integral part of the story that just didn't seem necessary. Although, this is going to completely contradict my last sentence but the drug and it's use I'm referring to was absolutely necessary for the last scene of the first episode and my favorite scene of the series",10
North America,"I was slogging thru my Netflix offerings, willing to watch any piece of crap they threw my way when I halfheartedly clicked on The Queens Gambit. Normally I bail after 10 minutes but this one had me totally mesmerized from the start. I'm now on Ep 5 and it just keeps getting better. Watch it you will love it.",10
North America,"I enjoyed watching Beth develop as a talented chess player, meeting the interesting characters who were part of her life and the pitfalls she faced along the way to reaching her goal. The story was excellent. But at top level chess, it was not realistic in that chess matches resulted in either wins or losses, and draws rarely occurred. In reality at this level of chess players are so evenly matched and draws are a frequent occurrence. At the last 4 world championships won by Magnus Carlsen, he had to settle for draws in the vast majority of his games. At the 2018 world championship with Caruana, all 12 games were draws and it had to be settled with a rapid chess tiebreaker. Even when Fischer beat Spassky in 1972, more than half the games were draws.",8
North America,"From start to finish this limited series is masterful. I have absolutely nothing but positives to say. Don't hesitate, watch it and enjoy - it is sure to claim some emmys next year. Fantastic.",10
North America,"Who cares about chess? the director of this show could make anything suspenseful and exciting. More intense and consuming then any show I've ever seen. My favourite show is breaking bad and this may give it a run for its money. I am shocked by how incredible it was; I only wish there was more, although I feel a very satisfying relief that it is over. I am a 22 year old male and I was not interested when I saw it but trust me, it is so worth it. I just finished it and made an account to write this review, if anything is worth watching, it's this.",10
North America,"I expected to be bored; I was enthralled, captivated, mesmerized (yes, I know, 3 things that all mean the same thing)
Words cannot accurately convey the right 'mood' this series conjures in my mind.Everything about this series is brilliant. The writing, acting, casting, cinematography, music, hell, even the wardrobe was perfect.Watch this series. Fall in love with the story, AND the characters.You'll be glad you did.One last thing; Anya Taylor-Joy is the next IT girl in Hollywood. A prediction.",9
North America,"Most amazing show i've ever watched. The story telling, the camera, the actors (especially Beth), the settings and scene, the music, the mood, the feeling, the intensity, everything!A masterpiece you need to see!",10
North America,"I never thought I'd enjoy watching a series about chess. I know nothing about the game and figured it would be boring. I really actually put it on for background noise while I was coloring in my adult coloring books( I know I am a nerd) but then I started watching it. It captivated me and the lead actress Anya Taylor joy it's stupendous in this. I ended up starting it and watched the entire series and didn't get to bed until six in the morning. I cannot wait for season to. I really would recommend this to anyone. Even if you're not interested, or don't know anything about chess.",10
North America,"From time to time a masterpiece comes along...absolutely magnificent. Amazing lead actress. A compelling story, and great cinematography.",10
North America,"Just finished the movie and feeling empty like abondened someone kk. It is such an interesting movie and every single ep is worth to watch! I even start to think about when will be the next season reveal and also where to find the movie just like this one. Applause to the director, actors, actresses and all the people who work on this movie",10
North America,"Surprising piece of TV.
Never heard of it, didn't expect much from a show about chess, from the screaming girl from Split and the boy character I disliked in GoT.
But someone mentioned I should take a look and probably one of the best shows of 2020.The cinematography is great, the props team have made an amazing effort and acting is damn good all through.If this doesn't take Anya Taylor-Joy places there's something wrong with the World.
If this had been a movie I'd say it's Oscar worthy.If I were to complain about something is the predictable script. But that goes for 95% of everything so...",10
North America,"Why the high rating, well, after a very slow start in the first episode, if you continued to the second episode like I did, only because I am stubborn and do not like to be left confused by a show. And while that first episode is difficult to watch and comprehend, the second episode makes up for that in spades.
The second episode makes the first episode clear, and now I understand why they made the first episode heh.Once Elizabeth is freed from the orphanage, she slowly and gradually gains her wings. She is an Introvert, and chess genius, and very pretty, (for a girl chess genius) Had to add that part in because the world of chess is dominated by men. And especially during the time period of this piece.You will find the costumes to be beautiful, and telling a story rather than just being a part of the show in and of itself. You can gain knowledge from how well Beth Harmon is dressed at any given time. This Annabelle has very intriguing and beguiling eyes, and they tell so much without words.Do not miss out on the Queen's Gambit, it is worth the seven hours of your life you will be as sad as I am that there were no more stories for our heroine Beth Harmon!",9
North America,I really loved it! What a fantastic series. Have watched this in one go. I have absolutely no knowledge of chess but this remains fascinating until the end. Great job.,10
North America,Smart. Dark. Funny. This is one of those rare gems that is entertaining on every level. Brilliantly executed story from start to finish. A perfect mix of intellect and wit. Whoever is behind this please keep it up.,9
North America,I can't understand the glowing reviews for this series. Well acted and nicely shot but the story is uncompelling and drawn out. The book may have made a good stand alone movie but the story was far too dragged out for a seven part series. Pretty dull.,4
North America,"Lol. I've heard only 10% of the population know how to. Any ways. This gave me an appreciation for the game but something was lacking? I enjoyed this but I can't put my finger on it? Maybe the way Anna plays the character? So monotone. For example the last episode was my favorite. It made me ""feel"" emotions and even cry. I think there was emotional miss/loss throughout that could have been captured better.SPOILERS: the mothers death. Her romantic relationships. The scene in the bar where she claims love still( for whom I don't know, couldn't hear) wasn't effective since we never really see any male relationships except briefly and they don't build well on them. Also they bring back many characters later in a scene where they go over moves to defeat Borgov felt flat as I didn't remember half of them. Also the scene in the last episode with the reporter( wasn't he a previous defeat?) and them talking about how she broke his heart??? I remember them briefly hanging out and a half naked male walking out into the room and her leaving. But have no idea the situation and later doesn't explain any of it either. You could honestly watch the first few episodes and the last and get the same affect. Any ways enough rambling. It was a good watch just lacking something...",7
North America,"How can i give it 9! There is nothing this show is missing i cried at a time and i got excited at another , i smiled i grieved i felt happy and hopeful i cant mention one feeling i didnt catch in this show
The chess games were detailed i stopped at some scenes to make my move and see what they will do
Her act was on point
Perfectly done",10
North America,"Netflix, please keep this gold standard going forward.
I cried at the end, I was so invested in her life from start to finish.",10
North America,"Stunning acting, photography direction.
Very rare these times.",10
North America,".As stated by others, I started to watch this series and I had to watch it all the way through in one binge! The Academy can save time and give the Best Actress Oscar to Anya Taylor-Joy for her portrayal of chess prodigy Elizabeth Harmon. I played 7th Board on my high .school chess team which meant I was not very good.
The story is compelling and the characters are genuine. Through Beth's journey, we witness the trials and tribulations of obsession, isolation, dependency, friendship and sacrifice.In The Queens' Gambit, I believe Netflix has created a classic film which rivals the likes of ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" Treat yourself to this amazing film!",10
North America,"Giving a rating of 10, I need to write down something here.A movie about chess is not so promising in terms of excitement, if not the contrary, but I just binge watched all 7 episodes in 2 days!To tell the truth, I did not expect a Netflix movie series to be this good. There must be very talented and enthusiastic people in the production team, resulting in such a great cinematic experience like the Queen's gambit. Netflix, continue to go on like this and you get our support wholeheartedly!",10
North America,"I love all things Star Trek but they have too many boring scenes, love stories, etc., that it might as well be called Soap Opera In Space. So what does that have to do with The Queen's Gambit? Just bringing up a point on how this movie was never ever boring. Always things moving, happening, growing. Loved it and ""power-watched"" it from start to finish at one sitting. I need to get out more :)",9
North America,"This must be Netflix' best of the year, and best since Dark.Perfect drama and acting. Amazing writing.I could not stop watching once I started, and binged it all too late in the evening (morning).I think this will surprise a lot of people, that thinks this might not
be for them. This must be for aprox. everyone.10/10",10
North America,"A wonderful fabulous quirky and unique serie which has been beautifully written, directed, designed and acted. The younger and older actresses playing the main role are perfect. Totally loved it.",10
North America,"Sometimes I really wish I could reply to reviews directly. Someone suggesting that it is not realistic and it's cheesy simply because in reality chess players take longer to make their moves!! Are you for real? So??? There not about to draw out the games to be the full length of a normal game. Get a grip. It was visually stunning, well acted had a good story line. I would rate it a 9 normally but just for the idiocy of some of the reviews languishing around the 3-6 mark. F you I rate it 10.",10
North America,"Watched this over 2 days, absolutely amazing! The whole sotry is well thought out and I loved all the cast. Worth a watch even if you know nothing about chess. One of the best shows that came out of Netflix this year I'd say.",10
North America,"Stunning. Utterly absorbing. And no swearing, breasts, cgi, guns or blood. A miracle. We need so much more television like this. Making a 1960's Cold War backdrop seem so current is genius. Emmy-worthy casting, writing and screenplay, is only bested by the pitch-perfect acting from every one of the cast. In these dark times, inspirational escapism comes in no better guise. Bravo!",10
North America,"If you know how to play chess or have knowledge about chess... it's a Must watch series.Each and every single episode is soooo perfect !!
To the point !! No drama.. no stretching the episode just to make it longer or more in number.. it's straight to the point and omg straight up perfection !!!THE CAST IS SO PERFECT OMG I CANT EVEN !!! You'll fall in love with her character !!Literally the best series I ever watched !!",10
North America,"I just had to leave a review for such a well crafted mini-series. Perfect balance of emotion, drama, character growth and story telling and most importantly a fantastic performance by the lead actress. A must-watch!",10
North America,"Everything about the movie is just so well-made, the story, the dialogues you don't feel nothing is forced and everything would happen as in real life. I feel in love with her character and I watched the entire show in only 1 day. what a SHOW!",10
North America,"I cannot say more that has not been said by other reviewers. I mainly write this to make the show more popular.Netflix produces a lot of ""good"" shows that are well made and entertain you well enough. But this one stands out!The cinematography is amazing to look at and reminds me of David Fincher. It plays with geometry and symmetry that is very fitting to the subject of chess.The characters and plot are well crafted as well. It deals with heavy subjects but in a dignified way without shocking or provocation. All characters feel like full persons and not just caricatures, and if you pay attention, surprisingly many of them get their own character arcs.The acting is fantastic, especially during the chess games.The show is a limited series and I think it makes it even stronger! I really enjoy this format and would like to see more of those.So, if you are bored by the usual good but mediocre shows, try this one!",10
North America,"How rare that we get to see such a beautiful and flawed woman conquering a foreign land where men traditionally rule. She's a badass and her natural intelligence is her superpower. Great acting, casting, direction and script.",10
North America,"I was always drawn to series or documentaries about chess as I find this world absolutely well.. out of it. People playing this sport are not wired like us mere mortals. So I started to watch the first episode and binged the whole season of course. The 60s' allowed fantastic sets and wardrobes and I loved it (reminded me of the sets of Mrs Maisel). Beth is a complex character. She's cold and warm at the same time. She shows no mercy during tournaments but she's sensitive (and a bit awkward) after the match.
I thoroughly enjoyed it.",9
North America,"The filming, the directing, the acting, the character development-everything is done so flawlessly to make this show one of the best of the year.Each character is charismatic in their own unique way, and every character gets an ample amount of screen time. Beth's mother is played to perfection and provides some comedic and tragic story elements.I came into the show knowing nothing about chess and find myself now wanting to join a club. I wouldn't be surprised to see this show rake in the awards.",9
North America,"What an amazing serie! The whole story is just marvelous. The acting is flawless. I don't even play chess, though I've found myself totally immersed in it. The plot is extremely interesting and exciting. I simply love it.",10
North America,Very promising show. Perfect tempo. Interesting story.,9
North America,"I have no idea how to play chess. Yet this series woke more emotions in me than anything I have watched in a very long time has.It is the kind of show that drag you into the universe, make you feel like you're the characters' friend, and give you an empty feeling when the ending comes. My throat was hurting from crying over poor Mr. Shaibel, and my heart was beating faster than Beth and Benny's speed chess games. The series did a really good job of conveying what was happening in the chess games to a non-chess player, without ever over-explaining, simplifying the rules or repeating itself. Considering how many games of chess were played in those seven episodes, it is very impressive not to repeat the same way of showing a game.I have been deeply moved by the complex personalities of Beth Harmon and everyone she meets. So glad I randomly clicked this on Netflix. I didn't even know it was about chess when I started watching.",10
North America,"I love chess movies and shows. Whenever I find one I have to watch it.I had never heard of this show/novel until I saw it advertised on Netflix. Anya Taylor-Joy is remarkable! The scenes are stunning! Supporting cast and characters could stand to have a little back ground, but still mildly interesting.",9
North America,I loved this series. The little girls Beth and Jolene are great and the adult Beth is amazing. Great sets great music great story and great acting. I've already recommended this to everyone. Really worth watching and a great finale!,10
North America,"Just amazing,we need to have more of this series everything is awsome,the events the actors, if you're desperate and feeling demotivated,watch the serie and live in a world of hope and determination,Thank you all for producing this wonderful piece of art ??",10
North America,Nothing more to say about this series but outstanding. Watched it in one sitting and enjoyed every minute. The lead actress was superb. Well worth the watch.,10
North America,This series is about Beth Harmon a young girl orphaned at the age of 9 that discovers she has an amazing talent for chess. The series starts with her as a young girl in the orphanage and she gets taught by a janitor to play chess. As we see her grow up she is played by actress Anya Taylor Jo she gets adopted by a couple at age 13 and then starts entering chess tournaments. She is now invited into a whole new world. The acting in this series is amazing the lead actress as Beth Harmon has so much complexity and demensions to her character. There are some other interesting characters she meets along the way as she starts winning tournaments and gaining fame. Her character is also self destructive taking pills and washing them down with alcohol. Some of the chess playing scenes are thrilling and you dont have to be a huge fan of chess to enjoy them. I loved the costumes in the series set in the 1960s and the cinematography was great as well as been very well written. I really enjoyed this series.,10
North America,"Everything in this series is well developed and played. The character development, the dialogue, the scenes, the acting and the music, making it the perfect series for this year. I believe this is the best series ever produced by Netflix so far. It is almost flawless. You will enjoy every bit.",10
North America,This miniseries manages to transform the intellectual and slow pace of chess into a very exciting sport. I will admit to being hesitant to watch this because I never found chess that captivating - boy was I wrong! Anya Taylor-Joy was perfectly cast in the lead role. She absolutely embraced the character and you don't doubt for a second that she's a world renowned chess prodigy.All seven episodes offer character development that blend seemlessly into the wider plot. There's really never a dull moment in the series.I just can't get over how great Anya was in this. She had the perfect look for the historical time period the show was set in.If you're considering watching this but worry watching the game of chess won't be entertaining - just do it. I promise you won't regret it!,9
North America,"You know that smooth, ""lose yourself in the moment and surrender to storytelling"" kind of feeling? That's where I found myself with ""The Queen's Gambit."" This is a story that has waited years to make it to any screen. It is well worth the wait. The story telling is straightforward, hard, and crisp. Characters are portrayed without predictable cliche. I love it when it seems there was a flawless dance between casting, writing, director, and actors. The slowly building crescendo is satisfying. This is one Netflix truly got right! I will be bitterly disillusioned if it is not recognized in awards season.",10
North America,This show didn't once take my attention away I started it a day ago and now I am finished I loved it and got excited on the last episode such a good find,10
North America,"Well played indeed. The cinematography, score, and of course, that beautiful redhead. Chess players and geeks alike triumph in this epic battle of nature, nurture, and most importantly choice. Well played!!",10
North America,"Superb and quite entertaining. They managed to capture excitement of the game. Highly recommend!
Suggest also The Opera Game movie, on the life of Paul Morphy.",10
North America,"It has some dark spots and sometimes hard to follow as the timelines change sporadically, but despite the main actress not being a super likable person, you are pulling for her the whole way. I didn't really like that it credited drug use as being such a major factor in her enlightenment and success. It does illustrate that drug usage can seem glamorous or beneficial initially but the risk is that it can and usually does take over your life. It was very well acted, and the story was entertaining, I very much enjoyed it.",9
North America,"A beautiful story easy to get hooked. Good acting, great costume and a beautiful end.
A must see!!!!",10
North America,"I've watched a lot of shows, but this is truly a masterpiece. Saw one trailer for it and I was immediately drawn in, but that was nothing in comparison to how compelling this show is. Not ashamed to say that I binge watched it all in one day, and it was worth it. The cinematography was amazing and the screenplay is equally as good, but the acting is, by far, the best part about this show. Anya Taylor-Joy like her character truly is the best at what she does, but even with the other actors, I couldn't find one instance where the acting was anything but mesmerising.",10
North America,"Is a very good movie, excellent production. Very realistic chess movie.",10
North America,Who would have thought that this series about Chess would be so thrilling. Everything about this series is very entertaining. Don't miss it!,10
North America,"My wife insisted that we watch this, and we just finished the first episode. Already, I can't stand it, and there's no way I'm going to watch another one. My younger son played chess for several years, so I have nothing against chess. But this is so excruciatingly BORING, not to mention depressing. If it was actually a true story, it might be necessary o suffering thru stuff like this, but it's pure fiction, so there's no excuse.",1
North America,Just finished The Queen's Gambit and have to say it may be the best miniseries Netflix has made to date. I have always liked movies about Chess and this series is up there with the best of them. A must watch whether you like chess or not.,10
North America,This little series was absolutely amazing. What an engaging and raw story told so beautifully. Such an amazing cast. Overall the most well produced Netflix original I have seen. 100% give it a watch,10
North America,"Chess games are really exciting, as is the evolution of the protagonist and her conflicts.
The color palette, costumes and everything related to aesthetics in this series is brilliant. Like the music.
The casting is very good, especially Anya Taylor Joy who shines as Beth. Even if you don't understand any chess, you will understand the whole game thanks to their expressions. With this series she became one of my favorite actresses.
In my opinion the only problem I see is that sometimes it gets a bit tedious and predictable.",10
North America,Anya performance amazing. The acting is great in general.Great production.I've started chess lessons.,10
North America,"""Anya, chess, 60's and intelligence"" these four favorite aspects come to one perfect reason why i should be thankful with 2020.Inspired me to come back to play chess since hiatus for a while. Special spotlight to Anya Taylor-Joy, she'll be forever in my heart as always. Well done.",10
North America,One of the best actresses of this generation can make any type of character simply the best series of this 2020,9
North America,"Amazing show, great story, great acting.
Beautiful Anya will win an Oscar one day and won't take long.
Watch it now.",10
North America,"Such a joy to watch, listen to, look at and relate to. Everyone in some way thinks they are good at chess. Its a wonderful look at the chess world while living a life. I had to look up that this was not a real story. Either way - what a story told in a book then put on screen with, actors, writing, directing, costume and set design coming together so amazingly!! Thank you. X",9
North America,"The top notch production quality resembles that of HBO's Chernobyl and True detective.. with this show, Netflix has reserved the next Emmy for ""outstanding limited series drama""..",10
North America,"Where shall I start?First the lead actor of course, she is mesmerising, hard to take your eyes off her. She brought the quirky, intelligent, independent beauty to life. Love the choice of fashion and music.I honestly did not expect a story about chess playing would be so engaging, its pace feels optimal throughout the season. The series entices with dramatic turns, and yet allows enough space to appreciate the details - artistic settings, the performances of a talented cast, and the dialogues.Everything is crafted with care and delivered with poise.",10
North America,"This hooked me from the start and didn't let go. Anya Taylor Joy is magnetic and the supporting cast are great as well. It truly is a show that sucks you in and doesn't let go. The finale was one of the best I've ever seen and ties up everything perfectly.Also, the aesthetic of the 60s is captured magnificently by the production designers and recall contribute to both the character of Beh and the overall feel of the show.Go watch this, you won't regret it",10
North America,"One of the best mini series ever made, an absolute joy to watch",9
North America,It's a two hour movie stretched over to seven hours with unsubstantial repetitive lines and prolonged staring. Yet another flat Netflix show that says nothing.,5
North America,Captivating from the first moment. incredible depth of story without any stupid tricks.,9
North America,"Barely know the game, but found this series riveting. Extremely well made, you wonder how a staid game can build up so much excitement. Chess is the protagonist, the dramatics personae are the players and the director is the grand master. One of the best tv series ever.",10
North America,"There has not been such a well told story of this type since 'Patch Adams'. everything was done perfectly. I'm not one for binge watching shows I've already watched, but this one I want too",10
North America,What a series I was hooked from the first episode. So much more to this series than a game of chess definitely one to watch again,10
North America,"I never write any reviews, but this series is a wonder!!! Simply brilliant, in very few occasions can one say the story, the characters, the costume and production design, visual effects and music ... everything comes together beautifully serving this masterpiece of a show.
Hats off to everyone who worked on this ... you must all be very very proud. ?????? ????",10
North America,"Absolutely wonderful, everything is beautiful. Casting is magnificent (I loved all of the characters), cinematography is splendid, fashion is incredible. I have played chess my whole life and aside from Beth's repetitive openings..... it has definitely made me want to play more. Thank you for a great series.",10
North America,"And i had the feeling that i was watching a huge movie, not a series. One of the best series i've ever watched, and no ...it was not a post-apocalyptic series.",9
North America,"Is the kind of series that you wanna finish in a day.i cried and I lived every second like I was there.every one of elizabeths feeling.
I will love to see more series like this.
I can't describe in words the whole feelings but I absolutely love it and I loved all the characters. Well done 10/10",10
North America,"Anya Taylor-Joy is just beautiful and brilliant in the role, the cinematography is great and the sorry is really captivating.",10
North America,"Who would have thought that blow by blow action sequences on a chessboard could rival the great classics of sporting hero films.Who ever took the risk of producing this script deserves a handshake. Books are not easy to turn into motion picture but what has resulted is a compelling story with complex characters that brings you straight into every next episode.Watching someone be the best version of themselves is very satisfying, but being the best at anything is something that dreams are made of. Inspiration flows dramatically through the season with a supernatural plot device that causes us to have a strong emotional connection with the protagonist.I was weary of the usual artistic trope of a religious orphanage being cruel and over-bearing but this is not what happened, the showrunner is to be thanked for resisting that temptation.The attention to detail between French and Russian culture latter in the season was amazing, combined with a heavenly score it makes us all wonder why this series has not been pushed and promoted heavily.",9
North America,"Pure 10.
Very very good mini series. I recommend it.",10
North America,"Real, melancholically uplifting. I was doubtful on the first episode, but I am glad I went and watched further. Simply a masterpiece.",10
North America,"When Netflix make mistakes you get Another Life and Rebecca.....and when they are on top of their game they buy The Expanse, make Stranger Things and The Queen's Gambit!
Whoever picked this book up and decided to pitch the idea to them is a genius. There was nothing about it I didn't like - the direction was flawless, the cinematography a delight and Isla Johnston, as the young Beth Harmon, and Anya Taylor-Joy are a credit to their craft. I even had tears in my eyes as I watched the last episode. Part social commentary on 60s small town America, as well as breaking into the male dominated world of chess while battling your inner demons, I loved it. I loved everything about it! And the playing out of the chess moves on the ceiling was what CGI was made for!
Take note Netflix - please try and pick better projects like this instead of making films that were executed far better by a past master....",10
North America,This series has no low points or boring episodes. It starts on a high note stays on a high note and ends on a high note. This series is an absolute masterpiece.,10
North America,"I can't say I've enjoyed it as much. Although it's exceedingly long, it's not the production or casting (both are particularly good); it is the story. Beth character is nothing but a cheesy mixture of Czentovic and Dr. B. from the 1941 masterpiece 'Chess Novelle' (Chess Story or The Royal Game) by Stefan Zweig. Unfortunately, Tevis's story has too many loopholes which makes this whole thing nothing but another superhero action.",6
North America,"It has its many obvious strong points, but I can't go above an 8/10 for several reasons:1. most of it - with the exception of the last episode - is oddly devoid of emotional content and leaves various event sequences without on-screen closure2. the focal ""achievement"" is a grossly overrated board game that correlates neither with general intelligence nor with any other type of socially relevant skill that might make good players worthy of the kind of respect that is traditionally awarded high-performing chess players3. it's the same old Netflix style liberal-progressive message that all we need for equality between the genders is for a few exceptional women here and there to become ""successful"" in some previously male-dominated highly individualistic, highly competitive and hierarchical field, never mind how hollow or meaningless that field was to begin with or how dehumanizing and repetitive (or antisocial or violent, in the case of CEOs or military achievement) the work required to get there. This is a pathetic shadow of what feminism should be from a genuine Leftist perspective (but comes as no surprise when the source are Liberals, who are right-wing).There are good messages thrown in there, it's certainly satisfying to see a woman beat so many men at a competitive activity, but it also leaves a lot to be desired. (""For All Mankind"", for example, is a much better recent feminist TV show set in the same era.)",7
North America,This show is a masterpiece..do yourself a favour and watch it right now..,10
North America,"This series turns out be 2020's true winner. Truly an exemplary series showcasing one of the oldest and most intellectual games in our history and the show truly pays an homage to this breathtaking game. Most of us have grown up on chess, moving pawns across the board or watching Gary Kasparov and Vishwanathan Anand, but a little girl taking center stage in a male dominated game while conquering her vices makes this show's each scene worthy of view time. The passion displayed by the main character for the sport where you can see her whole world revolving around it inspires you to find your own and stick with it. The innocence of the young girl yet with no fear in her mind despite her adversities and intimidating circumstances, truly dominated the show just like her plays and leaves us with a few lessons to take.A girl born an orphan finds her family in her friends, opponents, supporters and she finally learns to accept that she doesn't need to remain one. A truly well etched out character with a brilliant actress carrying this mega series to it's finesse. I love chess and show is an absolute personal favorite. Go girl!",9
North America,"What an amazing tv serie! Exceptional the lead actress, loved montage, directing everything. Yes netflix makes exceptional tv series. 10/10",10
North America,"They mix good between comedy, depth with ease and a lot of sudden wisdoms.",10
North America,"I was both, and the character and I came of age at the same time. What a difference 50 years makes!See the movie. You will thank me.",9
North America,I know this doesn't qualify as a helpful review of the series (which is by all standards great in my opinion) but it just occurred to me that Beth probably is the dream woman of all nerds (at least the ones I know) ^^ just needed to get this out of my head. Have fun watching everyone!,10
North America,"Not only a great story with great actors, this series captures the time through automobiles of the 50s and 60s and also the clothes, interiors of stores, houses and hotels. The character of Beth Harmon is so believable as a child and adult that she grabs your attention from the beginning. We watched the series over four nights; two each of the first three nights and the last episode on the fourth night. Just sorry that it did not run longer. A real treat. Do watch!",10
North America,"This show has everything...! Great characters, story, 60s set pieces, the acting and directing is quality. You gotta love a well made period piece that is well paced, even though each episode is long, and you can't wait to see what unfolds in the next episode. It's based off a 1980s book of the same name, and both actresses that play the lead really nail their work. The actress that plays the young Beth early in the series set in the orphanage, is such a talent she sets up the story well as it jumps ahead in time to her teenage years. It was a very original and interesting story line, and importantly, engaging... The process the main character uses to learn and develop her Chess game was entertaining from the outset, and continues to be explored as the story develops beyond the orphanage. Well worth a view.",8
North America,"Interesting and well made throughout. The later half had some slower moments, but overall the the series was better written and shot than most i see. Felt realistic and had no glaring cliches. The music was incredible. Might be a masterpiece and the lack of the last star might be my preferences showing. Overall i loved it.",9
North America,"Hands down one of the best series I've ever watched.
Well written, well acted and the music score is on point.
True to its time of the 60s, the story is told so well.",10
North America,"It was a bit predictable, but still a great series that surprised me, felt more like a movie though the hours melted together.",10
North America,"I'm not going to give a long review for this. This mini-series deserves better than my words could ever describe. I started this late at night, and finished it the next morning. The acting was impeccable. The story was captivating. It wasn't your typical chess presentation. I encourage anyone to watch this. It will inspire you.",10
North America,"Strange how movies on sports perceived to be ""boring"" turn out to be a lot more riveting than those made on football, tennis or cricket -- case in point: 'The Queen's Gambit' (chess) & 'The Greatest Game Ever Played (Golf).",10
North America,"Normally I'd never post a review. But in this case I must. This was simply awesome from start to finish. The atmosphere, the performance by the actors, the suspense and above all they story line. Well done to everyone involved.A truly classy production with a story to boot. I'm immensely intrigued and entertained. For the last two episodes I even shed a tear or two and I never, ever do that. What a performance by Anya Taylor-Joy!",10
North America,"Brilliant acting, cinematography, soundtrack, wardrobe and above all directing.
A class act of a series that is absolutely spellbinding, from its spectacular leading lady to the storytelling that completely sucks you in.
Some of the camera work in this was just phenomenal.
If I were to recommend a must watch series this would be one of them.",10
North America,"Finished this series within 2 days and was gripping from the start. An emotional story about how a female is dominant in a 'mans' game of chess. Although I myself am not that interested in the game, I was enticed to see how the main character played and would progress and learn throughout her life.The sets were amazing, especially due to the series being set in the 1950s-60s and captured each country beautifully. Alongside the character arcs all which had a purpose and were well casted.This series reminded me of The Crown of which is another very high rating.Would definitely recommend this show to anyone!",10
North America,"Everything. The actors, the scenery, the scenes, the makeup, the decoration, the design, the filming, the acting... all was perfect.
It was short, attractice, long episods!
Very well directed.
Loved it so much.
We are thrilled to such high quality content.",10
North America,"A great story, great acting, pacing was right on the money and a very satifsfying ending. They knocked it out of the park. Who thought a chess story would be so good. I will remember this show for a long, long time. It was a a story first and chess match second. NF couldn't have done better.",9
North America,"Don't find the words to express! What an outstanding acting (by everyone), settings and story. So glad I watched it - maybe the most artistical show I have ever seen...",10
North America,"I liked this. I enjoyed the acting and characters. I wasn't sure about casting Thomas Brodie-Sangster as Benny, but he eventually grew on me. I couldn't really give it a higher rating because it was just too predictable.It's nice to see chess get more mainstream recognition.",7
North America,"This is a high quality series, no doubt. After watching it I feel respectful of the creators. To me it's like a piece of art, a dark and beautiful fairytale with great ambience. The costumes, the music, the scenography, and the great actors. I love the 60's setting and the theme of a young girl excelling in a world of men. Somehow though, while the beginning was captivating and the actress portraying the young Elizabeth very acomplished, I found the middle somewhat lenghty and repetetive. I'm sure chess is exciting, but there is a Lot of playing to be watched over and over. It perhaps would have been more interesting to further explore the emotions, motives and relationships surrounding the main character. Or just cut it down a few episodes shorter. A mini series to me, as marketed by netflix, shouldn't be longer than 3-4 episodes. However, the ""endgame"" leaves me with chills and tearful eyes, impressed overall.",8
North America,"Never could imagine that a TV show about chess would have me on the edge of my seat the entire time, beautifully done and astonishing performance by Anya!",10
North America,"I played a little chess as a kid in a local chess club but was never enthralled with the game, or even any good. Now, many years on at 59 years old, this truly remarkable work of art was provided me a glimpse of the totally engaging addiction that the game can be for some. I binge-watched the series and there is not a single thing that I can criticise, although I am a self-admitted picky, pedantic, grumpy old codger. It is no exaggeration to say that this is one of the finest, near perfectly-crafted pieces of film making that I have ever enjoyed. I recommend it without reservation for anyone who enjoys fine film making and great acting.",9
North America,This is Netflix's best limited series of all-time. It is brilliantly well done.,10
North America,"Watch it, it is very good.
EXCEPT, the addiction part is treated more like an aesthetic and less like a profound issue that ruins lives.",8
North America,"Easily a binge-worthy series.
The acting is stellar by everyone.
Writing, directing, costumes, styling, cinematography is beautiful.Anya Taylor is wildly spectacular in this role. She is mesmerizing, calculating, and enigmatic.",10
North America,"Hats off to the writers, actor! Love how you brought beauty to the journey of becoming a master!",9
North America,The story is about a Chess prodigy. But the best part is even if you don't understand Chess this series will transpire you to that world where Chess is a passion and battle of minds . Anya Taylor Joy is outstanding. She is the reason you must watch it. Apart from Anya; the whole team deserves a round of applause for creating an excellent series about Life. It's struggle and the triumph. Feel Good.,8
North America,"The best thing Netflix has come out with in a while. It watched a lot like a movie, and I'm really wishing it wasn't a limited series.",10
North America,"What very well done movie. Ms. Joy is an amazing actor, beautiful too !",10
North America,"I'm not often enthralled, but this story did exactly that. Enough complexity to keep the scholar in me engaged, while containing enough heart and tension to keep my emotions on a rollercoaster. Seldom, since ""Roots"", has a mini-series moved me as much as this did. The character depictions by the cast were all they should have been and more. Anya was stunning, both in depth and camera-magnetics. She really commanded all the scenes and her wins and losses, highs and lows, affect the viewer viscerally. Seriously... Enjoy this story. Well-written... superbly acted... totally engaging. I'd have given it eleven stars, if I could have,",10
North America,"The character development and the premise of the show is great but they don't even show the board during the chess matches. As a chess player myself, it's kind of like a football movie that doesn't actually show the football game, they just show the final play and expect everyone to know what lead up to it. How do we know that that winning towchdown will win the game? We have 2 players facing off in a match but you only see the individual pieces as they play. They should show the actual game of chess as in the entire board. It's kind of hard to build the drama of the match when you can't actually see the pieces in play.",7
North America,"This series is the best thing to happen to Netflix. We'll written, amazing cast and every attention to detail is perfect. A must watch.",10
North America,Good for the uninitiated non-chessplayer revolving totally around a prodigy; a totally interesting and absorbing story. Anya Taylor-Joy and Thomas BrodieSangster deserve recognition for their artistic performances.,7
North America,AMAZING !!!!! BEST SHOW EVER ON NETFLIX !!!! THIS SHOW NEEDS TO WIN A FEW AWARDS. ACTING WAS SPOT ON. Anya Taylor-Joy IS NOW ONE OF MY FAVORITE ACTORS.,10
North America,With Netflix trying to push there diversity in films this gem is one well balanced serie. The story line is far out of standard for most drama shows. Overall a series you will binge in one night,10
North America,"It's a beautiful, vibrant and interesting drama. Great story, incredible acting, excellent camera work and special effects. I never imagined that the world of chess could be shown so dramatic, and so exciting. It was a great pleasure to watch the first 6 episodes. Alas, the last episode 7 added a fair amount of tar, too much to my taste. Dear creators, this is not how the Soviet Union looked like in 1968. This is not Moscow, the street traffic never goes on through the Red Square and the Kremlin wall is not as long as the whole city center, and children didn't serve at hotel restaurants, what a nonsense! And why everything is so dark? The last episode filled with strange speculations and fantasies of the creators of the series. It looks more like a silly video clip or of the 80s ""Russian loves the children too"". Maybe this was the point? Doubtful. Realizing that the whole story is completely fictional, it would be nice to shoot the whole film (especially at its climax) that is realistic in every background detail - this would help to create an aura of reality of what is happening, a parallel universe. It would make a viewer to believe that this is actually happened. Unfortunately, the fake and grotesque pictures passing off as the Soviet Union, on the contrary, emphasized the unrealism of the story and crossed out everything that has been so dramatized in the first 6 episodes. It is very sad, all that was needed was to watch a few hours of newsreels and do a very basic research. It looks like Netflix has not yet matured into a real deep movie production just yet.",10
North America,"If this show doesn't win any awards, then nothing else deserves it.
One of the best series I've seen, had to push myself to go to bed rather than stay up all night.",10
North America,"I never like giving reviews much, but i gotta say it's one of the best i have seen so far...",10
North America,"Like all the frames, strong storytelling and beautiful colors and lights through the film.",9
North America,"This is an amazing serie. I enjoyed everything. The pace, the storyline, the acting. I think this is one of the best",10
North America,"One of the best series of 2020.
You don't need to know anything about chess to enjoy it.",10
North America,"Amazing!
Anya Taylor-Joy - I fell in love with her, she plays just amazing
Filmed masterpiece, music is beautiful, acting gorgeous!
Everything is at the highest level, you just have to see it",10
North America,"Before watching this masterpiece i just wanted to see the trailer but i accidentally pressed the play button and i found myself watching the whole episode all i can say is You have to watch it , i watch all the episodes in one day !! The best Netflix series of 2020 by far",10
North America,"This is a good show. It is not perfect, it could have been made better, for example adding visual aids to chess moves to make it more comprehensible to non players. I still give it a ten, because here we get an unusual hero. Not loud, not even smiling, rather solitary with her inner universe made of chess moves and pieces. I find her agreeable. Intelligent instead of arrogant and mostly quiet, using her brain instead of talking. Exploring life her own way. I have had girlfriends, mostly artists, that are similarly interesting because they do not limit life to social and mundane things only. I do not like chess, (not chess specifically, rather games in general). So I am more interested in the passion and dedication as well as substance use / abuse and their effects on cognitive performance. The main actress is weird looking with her eyes farther away than usual. She is cute but she looks strange. She does a very good job at moving pieces on the board, so she had to learn moves instead of dialogue lines I suppose and she looks very realistic although I wonder what real chess players would say. Anyway, this is refreshing.",10
North America,"Granted I have not read the book but after reading some reviews I thought why not as this seems to be well received.
I couldn't agree more. The acting and story is well played out and the character development is so much that I really did get absorbed into the whole story line. Time well spent for me. 9 stars.",9
North America,"I'm more of a sci-fi guy actually, but this show had me captivated all the way through. I really enjoyed it and I even had to shed a tear at the end. So I would definitely recommend this show to anyone. Chess players and orphans will binge.The story is about Beth Harmon who grew up in an orphanage and turns out to be a chess prodigy. The rest... is for you to find out.One might think that a series about chess must be a bit boring. Quite the opposite. The chess matches are pure excitement. And besides chess there are all the other storylines that form the this perfectly dosed drama.. And form Beth's personality.I particularly liked the character of Beth, a smart and solitary girl, sometimes lost in her own world. Sometimes lost in the real world, trying to find out what life is about.Great score, beautiful cinematography, 60's fashion, edgy cliffhangers, and... which I find nice: it is neatly wrapped up after 7 episodes. If only Netflix would produce more of this one-season-shows.A chess quote to end:
""I am convinced, the way one plays chess always reflects the player's personality. If something defines his character, then it will also define his way of playing."" - Vladimir Kramnik",9
North America,This is one of the best series I've seen...ever. Couldn't recommend it more.,10
North America,"So , folks, after i ( a goodish chess player ) got sucked in the third episode , around two o clock at night, there come my wife awake an sit next to me , start watching , and at the end of the binge , me going to sleep, she stayed back to catch up the missing ones.
Conclusion : the best show .
Netflix deserves a gong for only thinking to make this show.
The rest, as they say , it's history . Or better , it will be written in the history .
A real gem , congratulations to all involved.",10
North America,"I could never imagine a film about chess could be so engaging. From a very well laid out story, deep and truthful character development, and fabulous scenery of the 60s, to astonishing acting by the main cast, ingenious editing and wonderful soundtrack, these mini-series are an absolute masterpiece.",10
North America,"This mini series is so refreshingly good. Many great series/movie kind of butcher the ending or make the ending sad/depressing, however, this one although wasn't mind blowing, was perfect. Throughout the episodes, this series had kept me intrigued and invested in the character development. Like the chess that Beth played, no blunders, strong development, and a bit of intuition and finesse, this series had done the same. Just amazing!! This should definitely be up for multiple awards. A must watch!",9
North America,"I had just about given up on Netflix. Too much wokeness these days and everything that trots out the stable doors always seems be agressively pushing an identity politics agenda. This show is a study in how you *should* approach topics such as feminism, sexism and other 'ism's, because it does it in a way that integrates into the story and adds to it, rather than detracting from it in the usual in-your-face fashion that is popular these days.As a chess player myself and a fan of the whole child prodigy trope as a whole, I started the first episode not really expecting much (Netflix?), although the ensemble class should have clued me in that was likely to be above average. Anya Taylor-Joy is a superb actress, as evidenced in some of her previous work, but the question was, would the script, direction and cinematography allow her to shine? The answer, thankfully was a resounding yes. The supporting cast aren't slouches either and it was an odd moment for me seeing Sam from Love Actually playing her antagonist/frenemy with such panache.I binge watched the entire 7 episodes and have the lack of sleep to prove it. Following Beth's life, from precocious troubled child, through awkward genius teen to brilliant adult was compelling viewing and I imagine lots can relate to her journey, warts and all, albeit without the added baggage of being a virtuoso at competitive Chess.The final episode had me fist pumping and yelling in glee and the wife wondering wth was going on upstairs. There's one sequence, during the final match with her chess nemesis, where her opponent makes a move that had not was completely unanticipated. Beth, initially thrown for a loop, takes a deep breath and even though I knew what was coming next, I was still yelling at the tv, ""look up Beth! LOOK UP!"". Look up she does and she manages to employ her trademark visualisation technique to wargame the rest of the match, something up till that point she had relied on drugs and alcohol to achieve.This 50 year old man hasn't been so engaged since Captain America smacked Thanos around with Mjolnir in Endgame.The series, while not completely without flaws, is a revelation and not to be missed. I foresee more than few awards in the near future and the cast and director should likely start clearing some shelf space now. Anya in particular is amazing. Absolutely superb.",9
North America,You just can't stop to watch. Great story!! Masterpiece of 2020.,10
North America,Really good series - highly captivating storytelling,10
North America,"I didn't think a series about chess would be this intriguing and thrilling. I don't play chess and now I want to. Anya Taylor gave a performance of a lifetime and she's simply one of the best 'prodigy' around now. The series is very well made. The cinematogrophy, music, costume design standout, of course along with the writing and direction. Netflix is on a roll lately and I hope they take up more like these.",10
North America,This show is remarkable. Anya is an amazing actress. Watch it. Not start at night ??,10
North America,"Amazing series, this will remain one of the best series on Netflix forever. Scot Frank you delivered a masterpiece.",9
North America,"Nothing in this miniseries has a flaw. Rarely have I seen such quality in every aspect. Acting, cast, script, directing, lighting, design - the whole package was absolutely perfect.
The original writer, Walter Tevis, wrote a highly unusual story, and they made into an absolute masterpiece. That's very rare.
I hope the makers of ""The Queens Gambit"" remake ""The Man Who Fell to Earth"" - although exceeding David Bowie's acting will not be an easy task.",10
North America,"Seven episodes were a bit push. It might have been shot for only five episodes. But overall, it was outstanding.",9
North America,One of the best TV shows ever made and first time for me that I wanted to start watch again just after I finished.,10
North America,"Everything was excellently done. The novel by by Walter Tevis was amazing. The creators: Scott Frank, Allan Scott were brilliant. All the actors were great but I fell in love with Anya Taylor-Joy. They call it a TV Mini-Series but to me it was just a movie which I hoped would never end. I certainly would like to see more such ""movies"". This is truly great cinematography.Brilliant!!!!!!!!",10
North America,"My 11 year old digs cheese. Saw the preview for this while surfing Netflix for something to watch. Checked IMDB...8.9? That's tough to maintain, but at 20k+ ratings, perhaps it's true.Seven hours later, at 3am, we both agreed. This miniseries is an easy 10 across the board. Story, writing, acting, cinematography; all top notch.",10
North America,"Well, I wasn't expecting that kind of serie. From the story to character development; it was very satisfying to watch. Personal dilemma of Beth and relationship with other people felt like she was a real person. Side characters also had that kind of depth so I was nearly convinced myself ""this person could be a real person"". Also show is not trying to sell a political view to its audience and it's perfect. Have some transitional mistakes and object based errors but it's okay.",9
North America,"I was so pleasantly surprised by this series for a Netflix Production. Good performances, good plot, everything great! Anya Taylor-Joy shines through the camera and does an excellent job. Such a nice story to follow..I binged watched it in a day with no regrets. Definitely recommend watching this!",8
North America,"I usually don't watch Netflix series because they have a simple and cliche storyline and the actors are terrible. This series is one of it's kind. It is about an orphan girl that has been through a lot not even understanding why and how. The storyline is very powerful and inspiring - highlighting love, success, friendship. I especially loved the last scene where she started shaking hands and playing with Russians (or beyond) showing that chess is a different universe, away from political dirt. I highly recommend others this series and I am very happy that it ended how it ended. Not a single episode or season is needed. It was all complete.",10
North America,"I had only watched the very first 6 min. and 04 seconds. First impressions: Poor acting by ALL who managed to appear in the first 6 min 04 seconds. Unrealistic scenes start at 3.33 and culminate, for me, at 6:04 with cursing and ALL characters acting unnaturally, even weird even for an orphanage. So, I'll pass these series. I have zero tolerance for bad acting. Not sure why so many has rated it so high. I did rate ""Rita"" high if you want to compare. Why would actors ""live"" in their roles in Rita and fake their characters in these series, is beyond me.",1
North America,"For sheer entertainment value this scores highly. I binge watched this up until the last episode and then watched that two days later. Something I frequently do with a captivating series to let it settle before letting it unveil itself.I enjoyed Anya Taylor-Joy's character Beth and her unusual looks carried me even further into her world. Her subtle almost expressionless face and the way she reacted to situations was mesmerising and almost autistic even if there was a misstep between child and adult. ATJ carried the series with confidence and ability beyond her years. I wonder if anyone else noticed the clumpy stiff backed model walk to emphasise her confidence.You were left in no doubt as to the era from the rose tinted glass American 1960s to the cold western version of the Russian 1960s and this did at times feel distracting. Along with styling AJT after Audrey Hepburn. Stunning to look at but a little mismatched with the Beth character who showed no interest in fashion at the beginning and suddenly bloomed. Picky really but it did feel a little Mad Men.I wish they had explored the financial side of it a little more. Beth paid the mortgage and then bought the house for $7000. She proceeded to lock herself away and glamorise drinking to excess without explaining where the money to live and pay the mortgage came from. So some thought on what the prize money for playing chess would have been might have helped sell it a little better. The living standards between Beth and the Benny character, who beat her and should have had more winnings seemed at odds.Finally, the downs weren't low enough or convincing enough to raise the highs where they were needed. It seemed too predictable at times and the ending was a forgone conclusion and played out that way. She didn't struggle with much and her addictions were cast aside as easily - drinking and tranquilisers were a major addiction and presented in a positive way mostly which may have been a little tone deaf today, but then this is entertainment.Room for improvement and this is offered as critique not criticism. As my title suggests this is head and shoulders above much of the drivel available right now and should stand the test of time. I hope there is no second series, that would dilute the first season and be an obvious money grabbing decision.8 - I thoroughly enjoyed it.",8
North America,I never binged tv show in my life. Let alone on something coming from Netflix which is usually horrible. Did not expect this at all! This hit me hard. On so many levels. Pure bliss!!,10
North America,"An interesting series with unusual characters but I'm puzzled by the anti-Christian message. I know it's seen to be cool to be anti Christian but it really isn't.
The main point is that this bit of the series is not relevant to anything, someone has just stuck it in because they think it's trendy or something. It's unfair and unpleasant.",5
North America,"This was a unique experience that literally forces the viewer all at once, non-stop. Amazing cast,amazing acting, awesome picture and direction, it takes you back to the 60's, it makes you love and respect chess and gives another , sympathetic view to all these geniuses around us.... So happy to find this gem. Just watch it",10
North America,"This is the best show I have seen on Netflix and I am no stooge for the production company.Great script, wonderful cast, really good acting and direction, with excellent production values.You don't have to be a chess player to enjoy this show and don't be put off if you think it will be highbrow - it's a character-driven piece with compulsion/addiction at the core of the story. If you enjoy quality drama then I thoroughly recommend this show.",9
North America,"It all started when I was trying to put my baby to sleep, around 7:25 pm.I was browsing Netflix like we all do and I saw this new addition. Usually it takes about 10-20 min for my boy to fall asleep so I said to give it a try.I went to sleep in the morning.Like someone said in earlier comments, do not start this at night.",10
North America,After the firts episode i was planing to wach the firts episode for the second season of the Mandalorian instead i devour the hole series in less than 10 hours. Best series that I've seen in 2020 and the last couples of years.,10
North America,"Chess isn't the most exciting thing so it shows how great the writing is to keep you riveted to the screen. Finally a series that depends on the writing and acting and not on graphic murder, sex and explosions to keep the viewers attention.
Seriously, if you want something different this is top notch.",10
North America,"The story is an amazingly written , performed and shot gem. Didn't make me doubt a second about the story's authenticity. It rides a fine line of what you'd think chess tournaments would be and being edgy enough to keep you watching. Opens a new world through the eyes and life of genius Liz Harmon.I truly applaud and can't thank enough the person who decided to use russian actors. The accents were on point. You did your job right.Another person who did their job was the set designer. Retro 60s show ? Sign me up!Made me interested in chess! Go watch it!",9
North America,"Oh my God, what a trip and what emotions! I'm a player and i am crazy about Chess but this movie took me from the heights to the deepest emotions. I loved the characters, Harmon and Schriebel, I adore them! Congratulations for a such a good movie!",10
North America,"I'm not a chess fan and am even less inspired to play now, I never knew about the strategies. The story itself, is beautifully told and wonderfully acted by all the cast. Stunning performances from the characters Beth and Jolene. A refreshing change of topic for a movie. You need to watch it.",10
North America,"Gripping story, outstanding performances, and greatly shot. 7 episodes just enough to tell a good story to entertain you. Now I'm going to go play some chess.",10
North America,"Chess. Amazing depth.
Addiction. Amazing psychology
Award winning performance.",9
North America,"What a remarkable series infused with intellectual wording, visual extravagance and, pieced together like a riddle.Do not take into account the fact that its based on chess games. Rather, focus on the wholesomeness that it brings with the era of the 60s. We have the time where stimulants were a big hit in society. The integration of ethnicity/race into the workforce based on quota. The exploitation of alcohol and drugs. The increase of females in the male dominant areas: medical field, professional sports, criminal justice, advertising reps, etc. And lets not forget all the emotions you'll feel, the inspiration you'll get, and the undeniable love you will resonate for the main character and her development.""I read about this pop artist once--bought an original drawing by Michelangelo; when he got it home, he took a piece of art gum, and just... erased it... leaving nothing but a blank page."" The Queen's Gambit",10
North America,"I know nothing about chess, but I can appreciate great acting and storyline, and this was riveting! I went through a whole range of emotions watching this, several times yelling at the screen...this one should not be missed!",10
North America,"Such a gripping story, amazing direction and cinematography. The series will generate lot of interest in the great game of Chess. Exceptional+brilliant!!",10
North America,"The overall aesthetic of this show is outstanding. I love the dresses and the location of the scenes. To be honest, I wasn't really expecting anything from this show but I ended up binge watching it. If you like the aesthetic of the show ""marvelous mrs. Maisel"" then I think you'll definitely love this. Its predictable but in a way, it still makes you intrigued.",8
North America,"Saw it twice.
Anya's acting on this show is amazing, you can see every aspect of the character.The production was precise with the smallest details.
I think that The building of the characters and the story line is perfect.",10
North America,"What I first expected to be a real-life story, disappointingly was just another feminist propaganda movie series based on a novel, well-played, beautifully coated, entertaining, moving but cheap. Still, all in all it deserves 8 stars. I liked it! Don't miss it! Watch it!",9
North America,"This show exactly gave me what i wanted. I started watching it agter 5 seconds of watching the trailer and binge watched it,finished it in a night. I love how the characters are shown,i kove how the story was built up. It was so thrilling yet full of sorrow. It made me feel like a proud mom but also so lost. The plot was amazing. It also is appealing to me because i enjoy ""smart,intelligent,powerful"" characters in series so Beth was the perfect character for my taste.This is my favorite so far,it gave me every aspect i wanted from a series.",10
North America,"I love how the series show the protagonist and her stepmother support each other. Also the relationships between her and the male characters. Not just sexual relationships, but also friends.",7
North America,"For whom didn't know chess at all, I still addicted to this drama. Beth Harmon casted by Anya did an excellent job to show Beth's cleverness and characters. I think if you know the chess can understand the narrates and totally found it more interesting. The grow up path of Beth I think not many of us would understand as long as you are also a genuine. It's not lonely in her case.",7
North America,"Definitely superb production quality and great acting. I can say enjoyed watching it but I could have enjoyed it much more if a deeper character written for Beth. First problem is quite obvious, storyline is so predictable and it's a huge problem against feeling the excitement. Second problem is actually related to first one ; Beth is unnecessarily perfect. It reminds me that saying ""You can't win'em all"".Who doesn't like geniuses? I love Rainman, Amadeus and other well-made movies about remarkable people. As for Beth, she's very smart, beautiful, sexy, fairly sociable along with her genius. The problem is she doesn't have enough weak points so you can relate to them. I wouldn't expect an autistic character of course yet needed more obstacles in her life to add some excitement to the story. She's been portrayed way too perfect because of strong woman concept, even her alcohol and drug problem went away without seeking any rehab or professional help made things really unrealistic. I guess being a female chess player or being an orphan is not good enough for drama. Eventually it becomes boring time to time seeing Beth is shining all the time. Of course a nice ending always makes you forget the hiccups in the journey.Also kudos to Netflix. Finally they're coming with some worthy content on their diversity and social commentary angle. I'd say it's a nice piece on feminism although I don't appreciate it becomes a movie more about feminism than chess in general. But I consider this a good step on finding the middle ground.",8
North America,"By far one of the most thrilling and emotional TV shows of 2020 and on netlifx to date. I stumbled upon this by acciedent and immedietly got caught in the rich story and life like realtiy of the show, the emotion portrayed by each actor and actress is astonishing. There are so many moments where i literally lept out of my seat from excitment and had to rewind and watch the scene a few more times just for the thrill of it, the challenges that Elizabeth faces throughout hrer upbringing and adulthood are all so relatble to many and easily percievable that ist allows the audince to truley connect and feel whaat each character is feeling. I can honeslty say that I dont regret watching this entire season in one day because I dont think I could live with no knowing who the world champion is. Ten out of ten would recommend.",10
North America,"Amazing find and a stand out title among a growing overload.
Me and my wife we glued to the coach while watching the limited series in 3 sessions. What a great story of an orphan to world champion in what is a fascinating game.
Loved the lead actress and the other characters and how the story unfolded to a foreseeable but still wonderful climax.",10
North America,"Netflix have been on a downwards spiral of late but The Queens Gambit proves once again they have the class to produce some of the best TV drama out there. This show is a much watch, regardless if you know the rules to chess or not. The themes of addition and loss are brilliantly executed!",10
North America,"A patient, intelligent, and strategic series; just like Chess. Well done, well done!",10
North America,"Utter garbage. Nothing to do with the real chess world, just playing on your emotions.",1
North America,"I didn't sleep last night because of this show
just amazing",10
North America,"I must say, The Queen's Gambit is the best series that netflix has ever made! The story, the actors, the cinematography just wow I'm blown away. Anya Joy Taylor is a great actress, the way she potrays Beth as someone that is genius but also troublesome at the same time is so believable, she's for sure is the next big thing... and Thomas Brodie-Sangster just made the whole thing shape into perfection. They both have very strong chemistry and I love and I would beg to see more of them. Please if you hesitate to watch this series bcs you have zero knowledge about chess like me, you know what just wacth it! You won't regret it, I promise you this series worth every second of it.",10
North America,This is best series I have ever seen. everything was perfect. epically there accuracy on chessboard! I watched many chess related Movie/series where Board pieces are wrongly placed... but is this series everything was perfect also acting was very good!,10
North America,"So pleasant lead role and so fantastic was the whole series. Suppose everyone can't leave it aside. The last episode kept me guessing until the end, because I assumed all her friends became KGB agents and their goal was to spoil Harmon's game against Borgov. However, it happened other way around and I'm very happy that it was so.
Netflix did an extremely good job!",10
North America,"Wonderfully engrossing and entertaining. The main character, despite being sullen on most scenes, is very likable and brings the viewer on a journey of all the highs and lows.While it may seem that it is about feminine strength, the series accomplished the feat of not overcompensating and making feminism an agenda. It is solely about her rise and stumbles as a chess player.Interestingly, the negative reviews on this page bear no sense on the series but are about their own religious extremism. While another must have been doing housework instead of watching an episode.Highly recommended. Captivating story and superbly performed by the main actor. Side note: costumes are wonderful.",10
North America,"Really amazing writing acting and music, its rare but sometimes TV shows get everything right, best show I'v seen since Chernoby, perfectly donel! 10/10",10
North America,"The series was just marvelously done! Without a doubt, it was the BEST series I've watched for a long time (and trust me, I watch a lot of series). Here are the points that made it so exceptional:The costumes were just on point!The music was exciting and beautiful at the same time.The plot was absolutely not cliché, and kept me interested all along.Finally, this genius woman chess player was not an ugly nerd with glasses like we are used to in movies.Watch it and you will love it ;)",10
North America,"Absolutely loved this.
I'm working on a theory that each of the characters represents a piece on the board.
Beth-Queen
Borgov-King
Townes and Watts - Knights
Matt and Mike-Rooks
Beltick and Jolene-Bishops
Shaibel- The pawn",9
North America,"Wonderful story, I loved each character, casting made this series even more special...perfectly casted, directed, location/sets, costumes, everything. Well done, thank you, I loved it.",10
North America,"I've never been mesmerized by any series like this one. All I want you to know is, watch this series. The cinematography, the storyline, the acting, the actress and actors chosen to portray the characters are the best. Don't wait no more; watch them today.",10
North America,"Amazing immaculate performance of Anya. Her beauty is breathtaking. The camerawork is art. I fell in love with the clothes, designs and all actors next to Anya. Just an incredible show done the right way. Wish they would do more quality shows then so many trash.",10
North America,"The high ratings are understandable as it's more of a political series than a series on chess, they have literally not left any stone unturned when it comes to social justice. Feminism, inclusion of other race, anti communism, atheism over Christianity and so on, everything that is deemed cool these days. While I do support these ideals, I would just say there are better ways and works in which these ideals have been portrayed in the past. This series just came across as some sort of propaganda.Purely from chess aspect, this show does not come across as well researched yes there are some beautiful combinations of winning a chess game, but overall it what they have shown doesn't come across as realistic, even the greatest chess players of all time have a 60% win percentage in classical chess while she literally always wins. The entire series is she playing a game and somehow winning in the end.Moreover there are many factual inaccuracies like a guy mentioning that in a perfect game of chess white has a winning advantage because it moves first and then he mentions the same is the case in tic tac toe, that's just plain stupid both games when played optimally ends in a draw. And even beginner level board game player knows that.If you love the political angle of this then go ahead and watch this, but if you are watching it for chess then you would be disappointed and might find few of the sequences cringeworthy. You can rather watch a documentary on Bobby Fischer on whose life this series seems to be inspired from.",4
North America,"This limited series is one of the best I've ever seen. Acting, cinematography, writing is all top notch. I binged this in less than a day. Watch this and enjoy the ride. A beautiful, well told story.",10
North America,"After long time good show from Netflix.. Interesting story, era and perfect acting performing. Just one thing make me laugh, the outfit and style of Thomas Brodie-Sangster. He looks like a student from elementary school who wanna be interesting man like Indiana Jones or some explorer... With that a teen boy mustache he was really ridiculous",8
North America,"The series lacks in the only two things that made me wait so long for the episodes:
It doesn't look like Tim Burton is behind it and it doesn't even look like it's from The Addams Family...
The protagonist is contradicted by other characters and all of this doesn't make her the Wednesday we know.What turns out, unfortunately, is just a teen drama/mystery that's still entertaining, I'll admit.The technical level isn't bad either, the Cgi a bit poor but not in all the scenes.But from a series on Wednesday Addams with Tim Burton directing and producing I would have expected more. What a great pity.",6
North America,"Have only seen the first episode but am aware of misintepretation here!The show is called WEDNESDAY for a reason - it's the adventures of Wednesday as she navigates unfamiliar territory. It's a character study with some appearances of the rest of the family. If, as some reviewers, you turn up expecting a straight reboot of the 60s sitcom, you'll be disappointed. However, the show seems lovely and Ortega, Christie, and Myers are excellent, there are some wonderful recurring and guest stars and one very delightful blast from the past on the cast.Also, shout out to the cast and crew - I knew you filmed this during a tought period in Eastern Europe when the war in the Ukraine broke out.",7
North America,"I was expecting a lot, and I got what I wanted.Tim Burton and The Addams Family are two universes that fit so well together.The whole vibes of this show were just amazing, keeping the whole Addams Family style but also making us discover a whole new original scenario, with the Nevermore Adademy. (I don't care anymore about my Hogwarts letter, just bring me to this academy!!!!)
The actors were perfect, Jenna Ortega was MADE for this role (speaking of actors, I feel the need to remind you that Gomez is inspired from the first original cartoons by Charles Addams, not the Gomez you're used to), having Christina Ricci in this show was also a very nice idea!!And of course, Tim Burton couldn't have made a real comeback without Danny Elfman!! The music was fabulous. Just the main intro music is so epic, I could listen in in a loop for hours!So yeah, as a huge huge fan of The Addams Family, I must say, I LOVE this show.And I'm definitely gonna watch it more than one time in my life.",9
North America,"Directed by Tim Burton... Music by Danny Elfan... The look of the frame, the acting and story all remind me of the two now classic 90s Adam's Family Feature Films... Wednesday was my favourite character in the films, especially the second one when she and Pugsley got sent to Summer Camp...Christina Ricci in those films as Wednesday was floorless, and it was great to see her appear in this too. Ortega's turn as the main character was excellent she is quickly becoming a great actress. I think you need to give the series time to develop and remember that it's target audience is quite wide, I don't think it's meant to be too dark. Just like the 90s films it plays on the dark and morbid humour, but with the teen angst mixed in.Definitely worth watching if you are intrigued, but remember that it's not an 18+ rated adult only tale... it's a modern tale on these ever classic characters, think along the lines of the Netflix Sabrina series... If you liked that, then this should be right up your alley.",8
North America,Honestly the show is amazing! Definitely little mad that Wednesday and Clair didn't get together but that's more of a me thing! The show itself has amazing actor's and jenna ortega played Wensday perfectly. But if you're expecting anything like the original Addams family your just not gonna get that. This is more of a tribute to the series with the most notably different being Morticia. However this show is absolutely worth the watch their is so much passion in every second of this show with so many twists and turns and laughs. We get to see a new side to Wensday never touched on before as she's now a teen and her dark humor is just awesome. I highly recommend watching or giving it a shot!,9
North America,"I think the whole premise of this project was interesting from the start. A modernized and focused spin-off of a decades-old gothic sitcom? Sure, let's give it a try.Without any real spoilers, the premise of the show is Wednesday Adams being forced to sign up for a boarding school for monsters. The plot is essentially a watered down monster harem anime meets Scooby Doo. A mystery is set up and it's explored with some average quality writing.There are a handful of spot on gags that genuinely made me smile, they are the exception rather than the norm, but they were still good enough to be memorable. Detracting from the well done jokes are a few pretty annoying identity politics references that are out of place enough to stick out oddly. Keep politics out of entertainment please.So far, I would have probably given the show a mediocre 4 stars due to very uneven writing. However, Jenna Ortega absolutely, positively, amazingly grabs the screen. She portrays her character excellently, delivers the humor, and happens to be a very beautiful person. She is everything good about this show and grabs the screen so well that she makes an otherwise mediocre Netflix show worth watching.Writing, plot, pacing: 4/10
Jenna Ortega 10/10
Overall score: 6/10.",6
North America,"What a let down this is. I really craved for another movie or series similar to 1990' s movies with Angelica Huston. I waited for this series, so excited, and it turn out to be a Harry Potter wannabe. The original movies worked because all other people were normal and the Addams were the creepy ones, and this huge difference between them made it funny and cringe. No humor here only tired lines, now she has paranormal visions, she goes to a school with vampires and mermaids and other things... is a cross between Sabrina and Harry Potter, no Tim Burton atmosphere, just disappointing and boring. Maybe will appeal to a younger audience who doesn't know the originals, but for an older audience who grew up with the real deal this is just pointless.",3
North America,"#SixSeasonsAndAMovie please!Netflix, pick this series up for more episodes because holy cow, you hit it out of the park this time.Ortega is PERFECT as Wednesday, I loved her in X and I love her in this.The title says it all: WEDNESDAY! This is her picture, her character always steals the scenes both on the small screen and in the Tim Burton films, this series time jumps us to her late teens and hits the ground running with mysteries, adventure, and spooky macabre humor.Tim Burton directs the first four episodes, and the score is by Danny Elfman!I am enamored with this series and can't wait for it to get picked up for more seasons, and the potential spin offs of the other lesser featured (this is Wednesday's show of focus, after all) should get fans hyped for an eventual Addams cinematic universe using this cast. The casting is perfect across the board, and I love Christna Ricci's character, such a sweet nod to the OG!",10
North America,"When I first saw the trailer I was very excited to watch it. But now I don't think I can even finish it!It isn't a bad series it's just does make me go 'I wonder what will happens next' or 'omg!! I need to see more'The first episode was okay but it just got worse over time, don't think I can make it past episode 3. It just seems like a glorified cw show. It's dull and boring, just doesn't have the same vibe as the last Addams family movies.I don't think it is the actors/actress that is the issue, I personally think it is the way it was written, if it was written differently then I don't think it would be to bad. CGI was okay but you could definitely see when they start to use it.So unless you like the last few seasons of riverdale then you might like this series too.",5
North America,"It was very difficult to continue watching past first episode, but I'm a hopeless optimist and apparently a masochist. I'm nothing short of devastated by what writers did to Addams family's legacy in this series. Wednesday is mean, bratty and malicious, in oppose to true Wednesday Addams who is collected, stoic and morbit. True Addams family is about love. This show's Addams family is about distrust, suppression and conformity. I really don't want to use that descriptor, but... This show is disgusting! I and all of my friends are disappointed. Casting and some of camera work at least is great.",1
North America,"So overall I think the show is quite enjoyable, Wednesday was portrayed very well by Jenna Ortega and the plot was generally alright. However, the romance in this show is atrocious. Like it is out of place and completely cringy, I had to look away sometimes because the second hand embarrassment got too much whew. The two guys who are supposedly Wednesdays love interests are literally so bland and unlikable wow, Xavier is the average, snobby edgelord and Tyler is super annoying and thinks he's special because he's not scared of Wednesday. He's so pick me, choose me, love me like god go away. Enids case is almost worse cause she has a completely random crush on Ajax, who's literally even more boring than the other two, like i can't list a single character trait for him and also the audacity of him to be mad at Enid for going to the dance with someone else, while he does the exact same and not even telling Enid why he couldn't make it to the date like shut up bro literally get lost in the woods what an unnecessary character. He drags Enids character down. Bianca was a great character, should've gotten more screentime, she has lots of potential which was unfortunately ignored in favor of stupid ""romance"" and bland characters nobody asked for. Yoko was there for like 10 seconds, which is weird cause she was promoted quite a bit and we just never saw her or heard her talk except for like 2 times. Eugene was cute, only likeable male character, he's just chilling, love his dynamic with Wednesday. The rest of the Addams family were great to watch, the principal and the teacher were also nice characters. CGI was uhh interesting but i don't care much for it so it didn't bother me. Biggest issue is really just the romance and some of the characters. Wednesday and Enid had a scene at the end of the last episode that put all the romance scenes to shame, because these two literally have the best chemistry in the whole show. I would watch a second season only for Wednesday, Enid and Bianca tbh. Well and Yoko but the team doesn't seem to care much for her character.",6
North America,"Another Netflix let down I have seen this show before and it was called Sabrina the teenage witch. This is geared to that same group teenage girls. Now I understand a show about Wednesday would have some of the teen angst and ""finding"" themselves but this tips right on over to a CW series. Did Tim Burton get gentrified? It sure seems like it. There is none of the character he usually brings to his projects. I think I really realized what it was when half way through first episode she runs into three ""normal"" boys who immediately try to beat this little girl up but of course she has her ninja moves and defeats them. This is the SECOND time she is attacked by a group of normal (they even tried some diversity with a black guy ringleader) teen age boys in the first 30 min of the first episode. There are bits to this that could have been fun or interesting Gwendolyn Christie is wildly under used. Catherine zeta-jones will never be mistaken for angelica Houston. I thought the Gomez casting was interesting as it did seem to be a closer match to the original comics. But again no one can touch Raoul Julia. I can see already where this series is going and I think it will be another that will flame out quickly for netflix.",6
North America,"I was expecting something so different from what i watched. Since the first appearance of the Adams Family in 1938 there have been at least 10 different actresses that have played the death obsessed 13 year old. But in my opinion there has never been one better than Christina Ricci... until Jenna Ortega.This young actress is absolutely fabulous as Wednesday Friday Adams. The facial expressions, the attitude everything screams Wednesday Adams.I found myself intrigued and mesmerised by the series and watched the 8 episodes in one day. Every episode has it's own intrigue and yet they fit together perfectly.Though C. Zeta-Jones as Morticia Adams and Luis Guzmán as Gomez Adams are not my favourite actors for their perspective roles you get used to them as the episodes go.A great series to watch in the dark.",9
North America,"As a child I liked the Addams Family. This cartoon series later on got filmed. That didn't quite get me. Then the trailer of Wednesday showed up and I was intruiged: images seemed nice, directed by Tim Burton (love his work) and so far the series seemed promising for me.I love the contrasts they use! It has Tim Burton written all over it. But the acting is at a childs level. The scripts are simple and therefore there is no depth in the characters. The CGI is quite disappointing from time to time, especially for these times. But worst of all: in essence it is just another high school love/hate/misfits/need-to-belong story.I would recommend watching the old skool Addams Family cartoon series instead.",4
North America,"I will start to say , the actors is very good , however all the characters were well rounded and played well.I really Loved it. Adult humor. Dark
The start is less intriguing at first, but once you get going you're hooked very quick! The plot is super fun to watch; a mystery mixed in with teenage drama (of course). The mystery aspect is really riveting, and I was guessing along the whole time to try and solve it myself. Overall, this show was amazing!Netflix are killing it this day , first 1899 , now this.What a big win for Netflix.Definitely Would recommend both shows .And enough of the nonsense hate.",10
North America,"Unfortunately I really don't like teen dramas. But of course knowing the concept before starting to watch, I had to prepare myself for a few obnoxious teens.The Addams Family (including the extended family) should be the only weirdos in the room if you ask me.To set this in a school with other freaks is a disappointing twist on the classic formula, and I find myself missing the fact that she wont be surprising other characters with her strangeness, because after all everyone's strange in some way. I takes the sting out of the essence of being an Addams.I can't recognise any of Tim Burtons usual flavour either. So there is more to be disappointed about there.I'm pleased to see Gwendoline, Catherine, and Christina. Jenna is good too.But I'm not really feeling it unfortunately.",4
North America,"Right from the outset it's just awful, Pugsley is a wimp bullied in school and crying? Wednesday is ""plagued"" with visions, sorry this would be a good thing to her not a bad thing that's the whole point in the Adams family. The entire cast is off awful acting very flat like they are reading from a script. Both Gomez and Morticia look like a really really bad cos play of the cartoon version.... very strained, unfunny and boring so far away from the original material. Will have to go and watch the originals, even the full motion animations where better than this!Just awful and that's before you get through the first episode of the season!",1
North America,"I loved this series. Jenna Ortega as Wednesday Addams was truly a match made in heaven. Pairing her alongside the character of Enid was a fantastic choice by the directors considering how their scenes together really stole the show. We got to dive into the backstory of the Addams family a little bit which I LOVED. Morticia and Gomez were amazing and I loved their characterization. Don't even get me started on Pugsley. He was such a sweet boy and an excellent (and refreshing) take on the character. Enid Sinclair surprised me with how much I grew to love her. Jenna and Emma's characters were an absolute blast to watch on screen. I wasn't too interested in the love triangle. It was strenuous and bland and left me feeling bad for Wednesday. However, I can definitely seen potential in Wednesday and Enid becoming something more. Their chemistry had me laughing and crying (especially at the end). Overall, this was an amazing show. It exceeded all of my expectations. My only hope is that for future seasons (please Netflix give me more) for the CGI to be more fleshed out. However, the CGI never once took away from the story or characters. NETFLIX GIVE US A SEASON 2!!!!!!",10
North America,"I don't think it captures the Addams family spirit entirely, but it's still a great show! I absolutely loved it and watched it all in one sitting. I wasn't sure about the casting at first, and I still don't think they're as good as previous actors, who held the roles, but they still do a great job.This rendition of Wednesday shows a bit more feeling than I had expected, wich threw me off at first, but it ended up working out well with the story.The plot and the atmosphere overall is excellent, it is dark, twisted, and comical. On top of that, it was great to watch a show in wich the ending wasn't painfully obvious right from the start. They threw in some nice twists and turns.",9
North America,"Tim Burton's Wednesday is pure dark magic, and it's fantastic to watch. - Yes, I'm actually quoting another franchise, but it has to be said: ""I guess you guys aren't ready for that yet. But your kids are gonna love it. Just a very entertaining watch buoyed by an incredibly magnetic performance by Jenna Ortega ... mark my words this girl is the future of Hollywood. While the show may not appeal to all, it's witty script and compelling mysteries should boost Netflix's 'Wednesday' to potentially becoming a cult classic. Without a doubt one of the best things Netflix has released in a while.Definitely recommend.",10
North America,"Wednesday has the toxic and acidic humor of the adams family, the wonderful performance of jenna ortega, great soundtrack and the perfect aesthetic of tim burton. There are some things adapted for the current teenager to enjoy, but it's very subtle and just right, loving it .I really don't know how there's a lot of people said the acting is not good , I really thought that the actors and the acting is perfect.I enjoyed every part of the s series, and I was shocked when I saw it I didn't expect that good quality of production and amazing visual and great vibes .And we don't forget the fantasy elementary was very good .10/10.",10
North America,"I love the show in general. Jenna Ortega did an amazing job on making her Wednesday intimidating, scary and adore at the same time. My only advice would be that she talked a bit too fast. What was great about Christina Ricci's Wednesday was that she talked more slowly and it really makes her Wednesday more scary. However, Jenna's Wednesday glare definitely beats Christina's Wednesday glare.The setting was great too, perfectly captured what you would expect in the Addam's Family universe and how you would expect Wednesday to behave when she is with other girls her age. I do hope this show can get more seasons and more mysteries.",9
North America,"I don't usually make reviews, part of the reason is that i'm bad at it.But the last time i was so hooked on a Netflix series was Arcane and i felt like it was due, taking all 8 episodes in one go.No doubt that Jenna Ortega carries the show, but the show is supposed to be about Wednesday, so that is not necessarily a bad thing.This show won't be for everyone, especially fans of the original Addams Family universe, but for anyone who is just expecting an entertaining show, with a sprinkle of mystery and melancholic feel over it, then you'll enjoy it.Looking forward to a possible season 2.",10
North America,"This is a great show and Jenna Ortega does a great job. However, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Luis Guzman are absolutely TERRIBLE. CZJ is bad but Luis is just awful. Both are playing the characters poorly.However, the rest of the cast is exceptional and the storylines are entertaining. I just cringe every time Zeta-Jones and Guzman appear. These are are the only mistakes Burton made in casting.I know there are some complaints that Burton's hand isn't really apparent here but it shouldn't matter. He did a good job with Wednesday and updated the family to the 21st century.CGI is lacking in some scenes but nothing too terrible.",8
North America,"Wednesday is not herself.They ruined her... and not in good way.They've dictated it's okay to say the B word and other bad words, but Wednesday can be
""the Horrible Mean, Boss, little girl. Instead she's saying please and thanking you, begging for boys and other. I mean come on, they ruined the whole point of Wednesday... The animated Addams family, had much better impression of Wednesday. It seams like Netflix it's just going through this weird face of school, teens, girls drama. Like the school good and evil... I couldn't even make it to 3eps without being disappointed of how ironic Wednesday is..",2
North America,"I like it but then I think it should be so much more.The casting of Wednesday is perfect, don't like the casting of morticia and Gomez at all.Tim burton directed this and all I will say is anyone could have directed this, what happened to burton? He has lost his style everything since he did sweeney Todd has been lacking in dark imagination. I liked the 1st episode and will give the rest a go. The girl who plays Wednesday is excellent in the role, not pining for Christina ricci, who is in this btw. However Angelica Houston truly made morticia something unique and natural, Catherine zeta jones looks like she is filled with Botox and makeup, this Gomez does not have the dastardly charm or good looks of the Gomez from the movie. Let's see. First thoughts. Will continue watching.",6
North America,"I hit the 10 before the titles - totally hooked from the first shot of Wednesday. It looks fabulous, plus Tim Burton has been responsible for many of my favourite films. The feel is exactly as it should be. It's Wednesday, it works without the comedy of all the proceeding versions of the Addamses. It occurs to me that those that love the Addams family are drawn to the dark deadpan delivery, not really needing the funny. As a coffee drinker from infancy, I love that Wednesday's coffee order is the same as mine (4 shot espresso). End of the episode and it's still a 10. The whole cast has the odd surprise, but they work so well. CZJ as Morticia - a big surprise, I'd not looked up the cast in advance. The first scene with her in the car - that ""I know I know you, but who are you"" feeling...... I remember her fro The Darling Buds of May back in 1991. On to episode 2 ..... still a 10 and plus an ""Ohh!"" ..... I have to go now and watch this a few times. This is good!",10
North America,"Just binged the first 5 episodes day 1 and had to force myself away. A great reinvention of the character in a unique modern world crafted by the likes of Tim Burton and Danny Elfman with the modern Scream Queen Jenna Ortega at the lead.It was a fresh new take on wildly beloved character I love the fact that it stayed true to the original story however, it gave new life to Wednesday and a NEW storyline. It's not a reimagining of The Addams Family, it is truly Wednesday's story!! The school, the cast and the plot are absolutely delightful. Tim Burton is a genius and I am 100% ready for a season 2.",10
North America,"It's a teen mystery drama, that uses words like ""mansplain"", ""gender neutral"", ""patriarchy"", ""female objectification"" way too often to enjoy the story. What happened to Tim Burton, the man who brought us many masterpieces? Is it another proof that Netflix can ruin everything?Also, apart from black hair, this new Wednesday has nothing to do with the old one, although Ortega plays well. I'm in the middle of episode 4 and I'm not sure if I want to continue watching. I don't think I'm the target audience, which is a shame because I enjoyed the old movies very much. I'm happy to see Christina Ricci, the original Wednesday.",3
North America,"""The Addams Family"" films are among my all-time favourites, and I had high hopes for this series considering Tim Burton is again in the directing role. But to my surprise almost every aspect of this series is simply wrong.One main problem here is the core concept. The Addams family is supposed to be a eccentric or weird family, and the main conflict in their stories -as well as one of the main sources of comedy- comes from the conflict between this family and the ""normal world"" that surrounds them. But in this series Wednesday goes to a school for misfits with supernatural powers, among which we can find vampires and werewolves. They seem much more dangerous and even more interesting than Wednesday. So anything special about the character is simply gone out the window from the start. What could possibly be interesting about Wednesday, if she's surrounded by actual monsters? She's just a girl who says creepy things. Strangely, characters around her still act like they're scared of her, which makes no sense whatsoever. Shouldn't they be more scared of the actual vampires and werewolves in the school?Another big problem is the casting. I can't imagine for a second that Catherine Zeta-Jones (Morticia) and Luis Guzmán (Gomez) are a couple. And apparently they neither, because they don't seem eager to touch each other. Pugsley doesn't look like Pugsley. Uncle Fester doesn't look like Uncle Fester. Every character seems off. And the title character most than anyone. Jenna Ortega has a ""sexy latina"" look that certainly doesn't match the Wednesday Addams style. Characters around her call her ""pale"", but she seems to have a healthy tan. Shouldn't a teenage Wednesday look like a stereotypical gothic girl? Is that so difficult to do? Also, for someone who is pretending to be a cold, unexpressive killer, Jenna Ortega seems too emotional. It's the most unconvincing character, probably because it's the one with the most screen time.Another worrying aspect is the comedy. ""The Addams family"" films had great jokes, which still make me laugh despite having seen them 100 times. And dark comedy provides so many opportunities... But in ""Wednesday"", most jokes don't land. And in some cases, they were so bad that they made me wonder if they were actual jokes. I've seen bad comedies, but I've never seen a comedy so bad that I'm even unsure if they're trying to make me laugh. It's perplexing.But the most unforgivable of all these sins is not understanding the characters and what made The Addams Family great. It was the story of a family that, despite having very odd members, loved each other and cared for each other. ""Wednesday"" fails miserably at that. The first things we learn about the title character is that she seems to hate her parents and despise her brother. She doesn't love anyone, so why should we love her?",1
North America,"Update: OK - my initial review was too harsh because I hoped it was going to be a show based on the work of Charles Addams. If you accept it is another YA teen drama with an outcast kid at it's centre it's more watchable. It's just not the Addam's Family really.At the core of Charles Addams creation was love and familial solidarity: that is abandoned here and replaced by a thoroughly unpleasant, self-absorbed bratty teenager being vile to everyone but especially her mother. I don't think this is ""updating"" the story but completely undermining what we loved about it to begin with. She doesn't seem sassy or funny just rude. The Addams's were always scrupulously polite - even to their enemies - it added to the humour and showed how classy they were, yet Wednesday is yet to offer a civil word to anyone. The success of any show depends to some extent on our identification and sympathy with it's central character but there is nothing at all so far to make you care in the slightest what Wednesday does next. I'm watching it a few minutes at a time and it's hard work.",5
North America,"From the first line... to the last!The series is amazing....
I finished in one day...
The story is amazing with the effects every episode is more and more great...
On the other hand the music is so colerful that's get it to the next level!About the cast...
Genna is incredible at her role.... i really enjoy her.Tim Burton makes wonders in the 4 episode that he directed... and what more can you ask when he have Danny to the music....
A Gothic storyline that make me clapping my fingers all the time and talking to the screen like a crazy teenage girl...
Yes I was amazed and I can't wait for the next season....",10
North America,"I was so excited for this as the Addams Family was my favorite growing up, especially Wednesday. This show lacks so much of her. She usually talks slow and mannered, she doesn't get scared of things, i feel like she never felt as an outcast in a negative way. She did show some great addams skills like martial arts, arrow, swords but I expected something else. I feel the show did not get her essence. Her way of presenting and speaking well. This feels like they used the Addams name for another Netflix teenage drama. The Addams family is very special through their quirkiness which lacks here so much.",5
North America,"Just watched all 8 episodes with 2 of my grandchildren (girl 9, boy 10). They loved it and we enjoyed all of it, from the music to the direction. I love Tim Burton, he did himself well in this movie. Both grandchildren had seen the Addams 1 and 2 before. I highly recommend this movie for 7 and up, some scenes were a but scary. They loved seeing Thing, but he was all scared up and no reason given. The actress who played Wednesday was perfect in the role. The school looked like the Addams family house. I think one of the best part of the movie was Tim Burton kept changing the bad guys to the good guys.",10
North America,"This show is brilliant and what's great about this world is the amount of characters and types of ""monster"" you can give attention to, plus there's more that can be done with the family etc. There feels like endless potential and possibilities for this show which is really exciting.The humour is on point, it has loads of fun little Easter eggs, I loved the 2 movies and the 2 animated ones, I was worried when I saw this was being made as Wednesday was my favourite growing up as Ricci had a star making performance as her. I was confused at the casting but Miss ortega is phenomenal, her eyes and mannerisms are perfect! You can see exactly what she's trying to get across easily!The show flies by, effortlessly entertaining, beautiful world has been crafted and it's just a genuinely witty, unique experience which is a breathe of fresh air. Whilst I prefer new content and ideas I don't mind seeing stuff like this when it's done so well.There's only 2 negatives, I felt Wednesday softened too early but completely understood story wise why she needed to. The other one is the casting of Gomez, supposed to be handsome, charismatic but a bit daft, but this film and the animated 2 portray him as an unattractive guy with little presence or charisma! There was none ot the cliche Addams stuff between him and Tish. CZJ was a good choice but pugs, lurch and Gomez in my view should've been better.",10
North America,"Jenna is perfect as Wednesday and she definitely did the heavy lifting in this show. She has the vibe, the face, the way that Wednesday talked and just is.Catherine Zeta Jones is also fabulous as Morticia, although Anjelica Houston portrayal is still my favourite. Mostly because I grew up with that Addams family movies. But both are fabulous. I adore them.Gomez is also good. Uncle Fester is perfect too and a nice addition. Pugsley is alright. There wasnt much screentime on the brother and I just found it bit weird that he was crying after being bullied and stuck inside a locker room. Thought thats like the perfect room for an Addam's family (considering that Wednesday loves to be in the Morgue's room).Story wise is intriguing for the first couple of episodes. Not sure if I really like all this high school drama mix but it is for younger audience + it is set in high school. The twist within the twist gets a bit too long, and I also thought they would do a call back to Christina Ricca but it went completely another way. But oh well.Just having Christina Ricca in the cast made me go super giddy already. Love her.Overall entertaining but I did fast forward a whole bunch towards the end of the season.",8
North America,"Some people take pleasure in disgracing a modern day gothic classic such as this show Jenna Ortega shines as usual but still the small minded individuals who thinks so low of this show are just as Wednesday would say , Most people think I hate correcting criticism but I actually deep down enjoy and I even sent a thank you card and we all know how that turned out . Just a great show with a great lead and to the febal embryos who trash this show I wish you the best luck with your remaining brain cells .It's a great show Some great acting and chilling scenes Jenna Ortega is the star of course kinda predictable but just as morbid as I could have ever hoped for.",10
North America,"The casting for his is so strange. CZJ is as gorgeous as ever, but fails to evoke the right Morticia vibes. Without the quirky mannerisms and innocently self-righteous tone, this Morticia is all dry and no quirk.Let's forget about Gomez going from half Latino to full, he now has a NewYoRican accent, has gained 100 lbs and lost all of his weird humor. Wednesday is doing what she can with this role-doing a good job with the dead-pan humorlessness Wednesday is defined by, but again, there is no underlying quirky juice to make her at all funny. She does things that are funny from time to time, but the jokes fall flat because her character delivers with a kind of anger that goes a little too deep.I think if you're not familiar with the original show, or the Sonnenfeld film, you probably won't mind all this, but for me, it's just not my cup of poison.",2
North America,"I know I'm dating myself with this reference. But, in addition to the Addams family lineage, this show made me think of the cartoon Daria. Jenna Ortega as Wednesday is like Daria, if she was sometimes evil, and always Drop Dead Gorgeous. If I was 40 years younger, I'd camp outside of Jenna's house. The show is very well done, with lots of Star Power, as well. The revenge prank she pulls in the beginning sets the tone, which seems to be ""Don't mess with her, as you will surely regret it."" Catherine Zeta-Jones also shines as Morticia Addams. One question, however. How does Thing, a dis-embodied hand, see to get around? LOL.",8
North America,"I have grown up with the addams family. Watched all the movies as well. Never ever was Gomez fat and an idiot. Gomez was always very charming, very clever and wonderful to listen to.Pugsly has always been a bit slow but never reduntant. I am so surprised this was directed by Tim Burton. It just felt Wednesday was forcing every word out of her mouth, keeping her chin down (idky they thought that would make it all look better?) she was so stuff and uptight it just felted highly scripted.As if no acting was taking place we were just watching a Wednesday robot. Perhaps Mr. Burton has never watched any Addams Family anything or at least that is how it seemed. I watched 35 min of it and disliked it very much. Christina Ricci was fabulous, Mortica not acting like Mortica and Gomez nowhere near what Gomez normally is.And HELLO Wednesday not liking Thing?? Threatening to hurt thing? Idk what is up with directors lately. It truly shows he never watched the show or he just wanted to ,""make it his"", which would be ridiculous.It seemed like they were trying to put ,""bits"" of fantasy in it yet failed on so m any levels. I would not recommend this movie to anyone and its so sad it has come to this rubbish. I rated 3 as I have always liked the Addams Family and also Christina Ricci, otherwise I would have rated lower.",3
North America,"This show is targeting a very specific, slim demographic and we are not that demographic. We are not a teenage, Latinx girl who is an outcast that lives in a world filled with people that do not look or act like them. Is it the Addams Family? Not even close. This is not even a clever parody to the 1991 masterpiece film entitled The Addams Family directed by Barry Sonnenfeld which on a sidenote, is qualified as a one of the best Christmas movies ever! It would have been enjoyable to see Christina Ricci reprise her role as Wednesday but as an adult in the working world, cleverly dealing with Karens and Susans.",3
North America,"It was watchable but I didn't love it.I'm not sure just how involved Burton actually was with this project, it doesn't feel like he was massively involved because this series really didn't scream ""Burton-esque"" to me. He supposedly directed the series, but a few different directors' names pop up in the credits?I was excited to see it when I found out Tim's name was attached to it, but it ended up being far too ""teeny high school drama"" for my liking.I did like Jenna Ortega as Wednesday, I thought she portrayed the character well and made it her own. Uncle Fester was okay as well. And Thing, but, ya know, he's a hand. The casting for the rest of the Addams however, I didn't like; they just didn't capture the essence of the characters in my eyes.This series had its moments, but as a whole I just didn't get what I was hoping for and was left a bit disappointed.",5
North America,"I am so sorry for this. Tim Burton MUST direct all of the next. This was truly everything but the BEST episodes were from Tim Burton. Either way, it was a 10/10. I loved every aspect of it. Each director had their own vision. Tim Burton had the best in mine. I have never related to another character more than Wednesday. Amazing casting so kudos to the casting directors. Thank you for bringing a show that made me binge watch all day. I have not had this since Stranger Things. That was several years ago but I just have to reiterate that Tim Burton MUST MUST direct all of next season. HAPPY WATCHING YALL, you will not regret it.",10
North America,"I went into this having not watched anything Addams since I was a kid, and with no expectations one way or the other. Wow, did this show amaze me! It doesn't overdo the teen drama, and it finds a great balance for humor in the morbidity.The story was surprisingly good, with plenty of twists and oodles of red herrings. With that said, it didn't push them to the point of brikg obnoxious, which was appreciated.The characters are well done with a solid cast (several great performances, especially by Ortega as Wednesday), and the show ended up having some real heart. It's not perfection, but it will hook you for one hell of a fun ride.",8
North America,"If you are watching this expecting it to have anything in common with The Addams Family other than the name, you will be disappointed. Rather than being the odd, creepy, but loving daughter and sister of the TV show, comics and movies, Wednesday is an obnoxious, two dimensional, know it all pain in the rear. She has been turned into the stereotypical good at everything, smarter than the adults, ""strong"" female lead that Hollywood can't help churning out. Hopefully, the writers will add more depth to her character as the series goes on. Until them, the series is a disappointment to anyone familiar with the original Addams Family.",2
North America,"Love the story. Love the mood. HATE, HATE, HATE Catherine Zeta Jones and Luis Guzman cast as two of the most Beloved Characters in TV history. Catherine Zeta Jones is too cheerful, round,
and well, she's just no Carolyn Jones. Luis Guzman? Are you flippin' kidding? No! Too fat. Too short. Too icky. Get over it Luis, you're a comedic actor! He's just no John Astin. LONG LIVE GOMEZ! Angelica Houston and Raul Julia were so much better as Morticia and Gomez. Still... not Carolyn Jones or John Astin but at least cast well. This is a prime example of just plain ole lazy casting. Could have been oh so much better with proper caring. IDIOTS!",8
North America,"Couldn't even get past the first 10 minutes of the show. Seemingly the Addams Family is a perfect story for Tim Burton to remake given both his and the story's penchant for dark, whimsical humor. What's disappointing about this production is that it lacks both whimsy and humor. Where there was previously a loving family that couldn't find a place in ""acceptable society"" because they went against social norms, here we have an unoriginal story about an angsty teen that doesn't like their parents. I feel this lacks creativity or innovation to justify the time required to watch all episodes of the show.",3
North America,"Barley survived first episode and will not continue. Main problem of this show is like with so many new shows today it just uses recognizable IP and first doesn't get it, and second it has people with no writing talent writing for it. They have no clue how to write Addams Family (in this case Wednesday) story to be creepy, funny or interesting so they just waste time on pointless things. Things happen, but most of them are just filler to fill the 1h mark. That makes this show extremely dragging and boring. Extremely bad TV. Wednesday motivation is silly, her dialogue is not smart and because of it not funny. Plot is disjointed and all over the place, some acting is really bad, some good, but it doesn't matter because what is written is of such low quality.",3
North America,"I gave a lot of leeway to the show, when I watched the first two episodes but after having watched them all, I can honestly say...it's very basic teen drama with some magical creatures.A lot of the dialogue makes you cringe because 40+ years old people tried to copy teenager language of today. Constantly.The CGI looks low budget. I have seen better in movies from 20 years ago.You can see the plot twists coming like a street sign, telling you where the story will go in five episodes. There was a 20 minutes episode of ""The Fairly OddParents"", that basically had the same plot. But we have an 8 episode season here, folks. Almost an hour per episode. How?Yes, it probably is for a younger audience. Yes, it may be for teenage girls, who want to feel special because they are ""just like Wednesday"" but I honestly expected more than that. Especially because Tim Burton participated.",5
North America,"I was blown completely away by this series! I've always been a fan of Wednesday, she is my spirit animal. But in this series? She's a beast! No other Wednesday could fight like this one!Also I love that Christina Ricci is in it as well, playing a teacher at Nevermore. She WAS my favorite Wednesday, but now she's number 2! Jenna Ortega owned that part! She was impressive! I couldn't get enough of her!!I gave it 10 stars because it exceeded my expectations. I didn't think they could replace Ricci as the best Wednesday and somehow they did amd it worked so well! The story was easy to follow and the characters were easy to love too. It all blended perfectly into 8 episodes and I hope there is a season 2 (fingers crossed)",10
North America,"I saw it without any expectations, but this one is so much fun than we saw it in trailer. Everyone can watch this without any second though definitely you won't regret.

Everything is phenomenal. ????
This is peak cinema ??
The plot, scenery, characters. Everything intact.It will keep you hooked until the very end. The thrill of watching a series is brought to life. ??

Let's go!",10
North America,"Just another average high school mystery drama. It was ok, just not very Addams family like. The show is about Wednesday going to a boarding school for outcasts and solving murders. The casting of Gomez, Morticia, and uncle Fester were horrible. Who ever cast them should be fired. They weren't in very much of it but they ruined what they were in. Gomez and Morticia were so normal: no passion, no intimacy, no romance, or weirdness. The show was predictable and cliche. Wednesday was ok but still not the Wednesday from the movies. And Pugsly was a total wimp. I almost stopped watching after the first episode, but wanted to give it a chance. ; I was disappointed. The show was only about Wednesday. The rest were in very little of it but they made it feel like I wasn't watching the Addams family.",3
North America,"So I thought this was going to be God awful like most Netflix adaptations, but I found myself laughing and appreciating the camerawork, the clothes, the colors, the acting etc. The way everything is colorful and vibrant while Wednesday is just colorless and unemotional makes Wednesday stick out so much from being so out of place. You almost can feel how much she dislikes almost everything. She's smart, witty, and honestly kind of scary. Catherine Zeta Jones made me a believer in her from her performance. From start to finish this was a easy and fun watch. It almost flew by too fast and now I want more.",9
North America,"It was better then i expected. This series is really awesome. It is so dark and funny at the same time. The acting of main characters is insane. I have watched the entire series in 1 night. Tim (Burton) has finally restored my faith in binge watching after so long. I couldn't put down the remote and was glued to the tv for 6 whole hours... What a magnificant transfirmation of our beloved charecters, as the lept off the screen and straight into our hearts. This was a jaw dropping thrilling TV show that i would recommend for anyone from the age of around 13 depending on how well you take gore. Will most definitely fined myself watching it again and given the ending I will have my fingers and toes crossed for a second season.",10
North America,Yes... I know... it's not about the Adam's Family and I didnt expect it to be. It IS called Wednesday after all. But that doesn't excuse it from lacking that charm that made the movies so iconic. This really doesn't have much charm at all. I was REALLY looking forward to this as I LOVE all the Adam's family movies.... but I'm on Episode 4 and I am STRUGGLING to keep watching. It's a bit soapy for my tastes. There is very little comedy or anything worth a chuckle. The movie's were full of that. The higher production quality is keeping it above a CW series but just BARELY. And that makes me sad. I don't really understand how this has an 8.5 currently.... 3/10 is the best I can do and that is very generous. The essence of every character in this has been changed in including Wednesday. And what did they do to Puggsly? He is a cry baby wimp now. The more I reflect on what I have seen... the more I dislike it. I was going to finish watching it. But I think I am done with it. The only character true to the essence is.... Thing. And they even made him weird looking like a Frankenstein hand.,3
North America,Jenna is really crushing it in the role of Wednesday. Every scene with her is just superb.Catherina Zeta Jones is okay as her mother but just misses something.I really don't like the character that potress Gomez but since the show is mostly about Wednesday at school the amount of screentime for both parents is minimal so it is not that big of a problem.Just wondering for future seasons if that is going to be a downside but we will see.The CGI could be a bit better so lets hope they have a bit more cash for it next season as that for me is the only real downside of the series and if CGI and cast would be a bit better it would easily get a 10 as the story is really good in my opinion.Shame we see so many series on Netflix with only 8 episodes while it makes binge watching a lot easier I do feel some things could be better if it has 10 episodes for example as sometimes thing go to quickly.,9
North America,"Having looked forward to Wednesday for months, unfortunately it turned out to be a disappointment.The first few episodes were okay but further down the road Wednesday actually starts to get feelings.In my opinion Wednesday Addams should always be heartless like in previous black and white tv shows and like in the Addams movie cyclus.Dark, gloomy, black, rotten.... That is how the full show should have been. Instead, it was un-Tim Burton-esque... Too... ""Normy""...
Let's hope that in the second series mr. Burton does what he always did. Make it creepy, kooky, mysterious and spooky, strange, deranged.",6
North America,"What... the...???I absolutely hate this incarnation of whatever this is trying to be.I loved the original TV series and the 2 movies from the 90s, but since then it constantly seems to fail and this show is no different.Poor Morticia is beautiful but married to a hideous filthy toothed crime of a man. Wednesday is... not delightfully weird, she's just abhorrent weird.The story line seems muddy, the characters don't seem to have any chemistry. I'm surprised that the OG Wednesday of our time Christina Ricci could even handle watching this train wreck happen. I'm sad that I don't love it like I hoped to.",1
North America,"I had been looking forward to this series since it was announced, and I wasn't disappointed in the slightest. Suffice to say I binged watched it in 2 days.The story caters, of course , to the modern audience, but it is not smothered by political correctness as most current shows are (which is a blessing). It is interesting, dark, and a blend of old and new, all wrapped in a fun Burton-esque way.The lead actress is fantastic, she really captures the personality of Wednesday, she even nails the dead, cold but intense stare. But kudos should be given to the rest of the cast, because they do a great job as well,I loved Gwendoline Christie as the Head Mistress, she really plays ambiguous characters very well. Catherine Zeta-Jones and Luis Guzman are perfect in their roles, and the actress who portrays Enid (Emma Myers) nails the character.Of course there are mistakes and inconsistencies (a rainy day suddenly becoming extra sunny, with no evidence of the previous rain at all, etc), but all in all, those mistakes don't negatively affect the quality of the series.I really don't understand the viewers who compare it to the movies, and expect it to be the same. It can't be. It's been 30 years since the Addams Family movies, the world has changed, we are supposed to be moving forward and keeping up with the times. Please stop comparing old and new, ""Wednesday"" isn't a remake, it's a brand new series based on one of the characters, not the Addams Family as a whole. This series, pays a great homage to the original Addams Family, but it is firmly set in the present- as it should be.Old and new can be equally worth your time, each one for its own merits.8/10 from me, with the potential to go higher for the next season(s).",8
North America,"This has to be one of the best Netflix shows in the last 24 months. All ages can watch and enjoy. I can't wait till next season. Actors are well casted, scenes are great. I would urge all to watch one episode and from there I will guarantee that you will binge in 1day. Just wish they did more than 8 episodes. Hope you all enjoy. !!!¡!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! As nyt said The news that Tim Burton would be directing half the episodes of ""Wednesday,"" Netflix's new dramedy about the Addams Family's death-obsessed young daughter, piqued interest. It would be Burton's first real television work in nearly 40 years, since he directed episodes of ""Faerie Tale Theatre"" and ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents."" And Burton, an often magical storyteller attracted to off-kilter material, seemed as if he might be a good match for Charles Addams's macabre cartoon family.",10
North America,"As a lover of all things 'Burton',and the works of Gough and Millar I was hoping this might be good.....I was not disappointed...I was intrigued to see if Ms Ortega could slip into Wednesday's shoes,(..as well his C Ricci did...nice to see her in it,also...my wife did not believe it was her when I pointed her out...),but she most certainly did,brilliantly and assured. We are 4 episodes in and loving every second of this superb show. It's refreshingly messaging free,(..unlike most of Hollywoods present day output..),and the cast is uniformly likeable. Add good script and plenty of laughs and chills,all add up to a sure fire Winner. Thanks Tim and all concerned.",9
North America,"I grew up a fan of ""The Addams Family"" on TV, major fan of the movie versions starring Angelia Houston and the late, great Raul Julia. Even a lesser fan of the animated series. The promotions for ""Wednesday"" were spectacular and I had only hoped it would live up to a fraction of the hype. But after watching 4 episodes of the 8-episode Netflix series, I am sad to report that what >I< have loved about the Addams Family; the sardonically dark humor, the double entendre of dialog, the characters whom, at their core, are deeply loving to each other. All of that has been set aside for yet another outsider teen angst series in the vein of ""Winx"" or later ""X-Men"" movies. Tim Burton's vision never evolves beyond the script. The series is superbly cast; Jenna Ortega is marvelous as ""Wednesday"", Gwendoline Christie as the Principle, in their brief appearances, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Luis Guzman rise to the roles of Morticia and Gomez, but once the setting moves to the Nevermore Academy, the story falls flat and one-note. The gentle but diabolical humor of the 1960's, and the early movie franchise is replaced with blood and gore, and this devolves into a teen drama. Am I expecting too much? Do I want that wink back to nostalgia? More Charles Addams and less Zack Snyder, perhaps? There are one or two great lines and scenes; Wednesday in the morgue, for instance; ""I just got comfortable, a few more minutes"", but that feels far and few between. What gets me is that when you think of the macabre humor that is the ""Addams Family"", this should have been a slam-dunk for Tim Burton. His movies all have that vibe to them. Wednesday, woefully, does not.",8
North America,"Well, if you hear ""patriarchy"" is being mentioned in every episode you know what to think of this show and who the target audience is. Has nothing in common with the Addams but rather Twilight meets Harry Potter. Also, grown ups playing teenagers? Juvenile characters and artificial dialogues to please a young audience. This Wednesday is the opposite of the original character. Originally she was supportive of her family not an aggressive, hateful and opinionated brat like here. No wonder Addams fans are disappointed with this one. They have taken some aspects of the Addams in order to produce some hybrid story.",1
North America,"Watched it all in one sitting, loved it. The dark and witty one liners were so true to the Addams Family I grew up with, I just wanted more of them! Which is meant as a compliment not a criticism. I could see the Tim Burton in this but it isn't as glaringly obvious as I expected it to be. I would have like more of the weird and twisted moments Burton is known for (I'm thinking Beetlejuice, even Batman (like Batman returns, the Penguin always really freaked me out...anyway!)) The relationships between characters are well defined, which along with the plot, keeps you engaged. Really hope they make another season, and soon!",9
North America,"Started watching this with minimal expectations and have been pleasantly surprised with how good it has turned out to be ,
This series is a spectacular feat from the twisted mind of Tim Burton. Not only is Wednesday Addams portrayed in all her glory by the exceptionally talent Jenna Ortega but she has been updated to appeal to today's audience both ethnically and socially accurate. The mysteries are cleverly built and the performances from the rest of the cast are utterly captivating. Bravo to the impressive cgi monster that has been terrifically brought to the screen on a Netflix budget.Final word - give it a try, you might be surprised...",10
North America,"My only real disappointment is the casting of Gomez, I like the actor Guzman, but not in this role.I would of liked the 1st episode to have been set in a ""normal"" high school setting, they could of explored/created a dynamic between Wednesday and Mortica, where Wednesday wants to stay in that type of setting, let's face it nothing more tormenting to a teenage age girl then ""knowing"" they don't fit in.I've read a few reviews were people or disappointed in this episode, expecting a more traditional Wednsday, my opinion, I feel both Burton and Ortega have successfully ""Grown ""Wednesday into a teenage girl.......those of you who have quirky daughters will appreciate this teenage Wednesday .I was never a big Tim Burton, always thought he was too over the top with sets, I do like the school, it's a more believeable place then hogwartz,
I'm looking forward to the rest of the season.",8
North America,"Being a huge Addams fan (owning the books by Chas Addams, the tv series, the movies and, yes, even the cartoons) I've been looking forward to this new iteration since it was announced a year or two ago. I can tell you it doesn't disappoint and, in fact, delivers on all fronts. Following Christina Ricci's iconic performance is a tall order for anyone but Jenna Ortega knocks it out of the park with her portrayal of the titles title character. Her dead pan, sarcastic delivery is spot on but there's a sweetness to get poison tongue... You know, like ethylene glycol.Rather than compete with the beautiful Angelica Houston, Catherine Zeta Jones brings her own interpretation to Morticia while Luis Guzman brings to life the Gomez Addams as he appeared in the original New Yorker Cartoons. This is a smart move because when it comes to the late, great Raul Julia.... Well, just don't. There's just no replacing him so sidestepping that issue was the best thing they could do.. Who is also here...Thing, that is. Along with Lurch, Pugsley and Uncle Fester.There are also some surprises in the cast that I haven't mentioned.Tim Burton has done a terrific job here of both updating and continuing the adventures of our favorite spooky family and I'm really looking forward to season 2.",9
North America,"Highly dubious as am an avid fan of Christina Ricci's portrayal of Wednesday Addams.But for the love of God. Stop with the rapid fire dialogue, jerky spouting of lines and the overtly aggressive delivery. Wednesday was so disarmingly loved due to her paced, frighteningly calm delivery.I had hope at the appearance of very special cameo. But it really hasn't eased.Love the appraisal of a semi familiar fac of a character that was in the original as a love interest.The breathy line delivery of all cast members is distracting at best. Not every line has to be delivered like a sledgehammer for Gothic dramatic effect.Will hang in and hope that they calm down somewhat. Otherwise holds delicious promise.",7
North America,"!!!!!!SPOILERS!!!!!! This show is the absolute best show. The entire show I was super excited about what was happening and was super shocked when Wednesday saw her ancestors from 400 years ago. I haven't watched the entire show yet but i already watched 4 episodes. I get to watch this again with my girlfriend this weekend and I'm super excited because this might become one of my hyper fixations. You should definitely watch this show if you like mystery, horror, and suspenseful shows than this is perfect for you. You definitely need to watch this as soon as possible because this show is perfect.10/10.",10
North America,"This was such a disappointment. I had been excited for a new Addams Family show/movie but feel like this missed on all the things that made the others good. At no point did I feel amused, much less laugh. The whole world has been changed to fantasy creatures (vampires, werewolves, sirens) being known to exist, makes the Addams' not weird. The Addams' were always extremely polite and classy. Wednesday is definitely rude not classy and sassy. Gomez was not witty and classy, Morticia was bland, Pugsly was pathetic. The family ties that bonded the Addams' in the past and was so important was absolutely gone.Aside from that, there was a common camera angle used that cut off the top of people's heads that was really annoying to me.",1
North America,"I think the show is great, I love the fact that they added more fantasy and magic to original Addams Universum as I am a big fan of this genre, I love the hint of Harry Potter in form of the school itself and Poe Cup, I love the witty, clever and sarcastic dialogs and I think what I love the most is Thing showing the middle finger or sulking <3.Apart from that the show presents a strong female character who is not afraid to fight for her beliefs and some complicated mother-daughter relationship.The cast is perfect, especially with the idea that Christina Ricci plays one of the roles, I just hope that it would develop in a franchise which will span on many seasons :)",10
North America,"I was unlucky and got sick, but lucky enough that it happened when Wednesday was released. Made it all more bearable and I watched the entire series with great pleasure. I loved the atmosphere, the characters and also the story.It's kind of interesting how they made a date in a crypt turn romantic. This will be exactly how all girls will want to celebrate Valentine's Day 2023.Also, I want to give the biggest round of applause to the costume creator, I want Wednesday's entire wardrobe. So crazy that I seriously ordered a black/white checkered knit dress! Love it!!I give it a 10*. Though the ending was quite predictable, but who cares..See it!",10
North America,"Being a life long fan of the Addams family I was looking forward to this new series and got much more than I hoped for. At first was a little hard to adapt to the new actors (Gomez, Morticia) but it all takes perfect shape and everyone seems to find their place. Great mystery, plenty of dark, dry humor and one or two inside jokes for us older folk that were fans of the original series. Hope they continue this series. Jenna Ortega channels Wednesday Addams so perfectly and seems to just naturally be the perfect fit for the role. The added bits of teen drama fit nicely through the story and aren't forced or stereotypical gunk that is usually added to pander to an age group. Really enjoying this series.",10
North America,I just wanna say Ortega bravo. I loved her performance & congratulations Netflix on a great casting. Everything I ever expected happened. Every one should watch it & what unexpected twist.would love to see another season. I can not wait to see many of her other talents. Would love to see more of uncle fester. Truly making friends can be hard but sometimes it turns out great. But I also learnt many things from Wednesday Addams but the most important one was don't make other people define who you are & who you are gonna be. & the suspense is killing me WEDNESDAY ADDAMS. CANT wait on WHAT WOULD WEDNESDAY ADDAMS DO.,10
North America,"A series for kids I guess, might be a good one time watch when you've a lot of free time. It wasn't boring, moderately enjoyable, nice. All the characters has done their part nicely. Jenna ortega as Wednesday adams was praiseworthy. But I hoped to see the Adams family a bit more. But no further season is needed in my opinion, probably make a spin off series of Pugsley now! People are gushing over a little too much over this I guess. The series deserves a 5 star rating that's appropriate in my opinion. That's all from me. Why do we have to write such a long ass review? Ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.",5
North America,"Okay whattttt?! I was not expecting this to be that good. But I was hooked immediately. The whole production is so good. I only wish Netflix had released it in October because it would be so perfect for Halloween. Tim Burton is a phenomenal director, and every cast member is perfect for their roles. Jenna plays Wednesday so well, I saw an interview where she spoke about taking direction from Burton. You can tell she really enjoyed playing the character, and her commitment shows on screen. The ""high school"" Netflix show trope has run its course so many times before, it feels stale, but this is so obviously different and fresh.",10
North America,"I'll make this short, and not divulge any spoilers.I really enjoyed this a lot, and certainly hope that it gets additional seasons. The sole (minimal) levity in the whole series relates to a few situations involving ""Thing"". Beyond that, pretty much everything else revolves around a dark story line, and dark events (monsters, killings ,etc.), with the main character (Wednesday) determined to figure out what is going on. Ortega provides a stunningly great performance as Wednesday, and there is a great supporting cast, who also do an excellent job, to complement Ortega's performance.This is really just a horror series, although, for the most part, considerably more subtle than the typical horror outing. It's Ortega's consistent character that keeps the viewer embedded in the ongoing activities, and not allowing it to slip off into some lesser (silly) genre. It's definitely an interesting binge.",10
North America,"So I'm... pretty underwhelmed. Having only seen episode one, I'm torn between the hope it might get better after a few episodes, and exasperation at Wednesday being so unbelievably unlikeable.I get that Wednesday is supposed to be dark and moody and obsessed with death - none of which I would mind.'This' Wednesday is incapable of having a conversation with anyone without saying something hurtful or condescending, and it very quickly loses its charm - if there ever was any. She's the main character, and we're supposed to be rooting for her, but I find it incredibly difficult to do so. I actually keep hoping someone will put her in her place.As most teenage girl protagonists these days, she considers herself a victim of parental oppression (after they send her to a school for ""outcasts"" rather than let her get charged for attempted murder, how awful of them). She's like a not-funny parody of what a moody teenager is like.Aside from generally disliking the titular character, there's other stuff I'm not a fan of either. The cliche school cliques, the ""all grown-ups are enemies""-trope, the fact that this series seems way too much like any generic YA fantasy series to be an actual Burton project... like, I'm upset, ya'll.But Wednesday's behaviour and demeanour is by far what puts me off the most. She's got the perfect grades, is the one who protects her bullied little brother, is amazing at fencing, and writing, and saying really smart-sounding things... but she's so friggin mean and malicious to 'everyone', including those who truly have done nothing to deserve it. She's a mean Mary Sue.I will keep watching just to see if it gets better, but I'm not too hopeful.",3
North America,"I was not expecting this to be any good, considering it's done by netflix, however I was greatly impressed with this show, think it just became my favorite of the year.You will see lot of people saying ""This is not for you"" as if they know better and as in they take the decision for you, however, I would greatly recommend giving the show a try and decide it for yourself if you like it not.Jenna Ortega is wonderful cast in the role, but pretty much everyone else just as well, the acting is great, the music, the effects - everything, I can't say I could think of any negative thing to say about it except the fact that I didn't enjoy how her father Gomez was introduced but is something I could easily get past since the show is about Wdnesday and not her family. (though nothing wrong with the actor or acting for Gomez either, just how he was written).You should never let other people dictate what to watch, you cannot discuss taste or force people into liking the same things. Many shows released this year got a huge wave of hate and almost made me skip watching them just because others said they are bad...and guess what ? I ended up enjoying many of them.As I write this review, the show is rated at 8.5 stars after 5,5k votes, which means those that dislike the show are in such low number that it doesn't even affect the show overall.Happy binge day.",10
North America,"As a huge fan of not only the Addams Family, but Tim Burton as well, this show exceeded my expectations! I binge watched the entire season in one evening & couldn't stop watching! I honestly feel like those who complained about it being ""too far from the original Addams family"" missed the entire point of it being a coming of age/teenage PROGRESSION. It's not a remake, it's not even a sequel to the old movies, it is its own entity & shows the maturity of Wednesday and her coming in to her own. Also, those complaining about the casting, especially with Gomez, obviously aren't familiar with the original comics the show was based on to begin with: the casting was actually pretty spot on, with its own original flair added. Tim Burton has always been imaginative, creative and a visionary and ""Wednesday"" is no exception. Fingers crossed for a second season.",10
North America,"I loved this series from the first episode, so intriguing, I would love to see more.I feel like i can relate to Wednesday's character so much which makes me enjoy it even more. Binge-watched it and now i can't wait for a new season. It had just the right amount of everything.I began to watch it due to me being a big fan of Jenna Ortega. She was the perfect choice for this and no one could've done it better.Each episode left me wanting to watch more, I do recommend this for people of ages between 10-30. In my experience with older adults I believe they would not enjoy it as much, but should still give it a try.Once again hoping to see more.Season 2 WHENN???",10
North America,"This is literally the best netflix series I've ever watched. The dark comedy, atmosphere, mystery, intensity and acting everything was just right for captivating me. Usually when I watch series there are some boring parts or dialogues that I skip but not this time. I watched it to completion in one go. Definitely a 10/10 for me. It's trailer was enough for make me wait for it, thankfully the series didn't disappoint at any level. Jenna ortega performed her role exemplary she was truly amazing I loved it ??. The best thing in this series was wednesday herself and the second will be its mystery which forces you to suspect many characters at the same time and that captivates you till the end. Definitely a 10/10 for me. Already waiting for 2nd season.",10
North America,"Whatever people were expecting from Tim Burton, he delivered it & even 10 times more than that.Brilliant Direction & Brilliant Writing throughout the series. Unlike some other recent mystery movies & series, villain's identity was so well hidden & everybody seemed villain till the end. I did not lose interest at any point in the series.Brilliant brilliant work by everyone, especially the lead Jenna Ortega. Probably the best work by her till date. Watching her since Jane the Virgin & Stick in the middle & she is getting better day by day.Emma Myers, Christina Ricci, Hunter Doohan, Percy White, did good work too.Series finished with an open end, so I'm hoping there will be season 2.",9
North America,"I love the original Addams Family films and was curious whether this would be anywhere near as good and I'm pleasantly surprised by how brilliant it is. So many shows nowadays are so predictable and cringe but this was really funny the whole way through. The casting and acting was spot on, (love how Christina Ricci, the OG Wednesday, is in the show), the camerawork and colour grading are excellent and the wardrobe and music are great too. Really enjoyed this series and want more! I would've given 10 stars if there were more episodes, 8 is not enough! ...........................................",9
North America,"Nice production and the performance of the lead actress, but the show was just too predicable. Was the main lady villain based off of the sheep villain from Zootopia? The overt friendliness and just over the top good intent? The same for the monster, they went about it in a too obvious manner - they shed the least suspicion on him which was a give away.I don't know for the half of it I was gripped and interested, but then when they confirmed who the villains are, I was so disappointed.I really feel like it could have been better, but it was okay to watch nevertheless. I don't have hopes for a better season two unfortunately though.",5
North America,"Its entertaining and has harry potter vibes, frankly entertaining, but there is still the odd comment and action by wednesday that feels out of place and more to do with current stances on this, now it's not overly in your face, but really, can you just entertain me and not lecture, since whoever still doesnt know how to conduct themselves in 'modern' social media world, isnt going to care and perhaps needs reminding, the general viewer who does care about how to treat people already knows how to treat people.Apart from what I've 'splaned' the first few episodes were really interesting
and the the vibe, but it's moving more and more towards something else - only three episodes in so maybe the score will get higher.Kudos to the team :)",5
North America,"While randomly picking up my upcoming show to watch on Netflix, its oversimplified title did not really give me any promising expectation.But thing went straight for me to realize it was definitely what I should have spent my day on, when the background was briefly mentioned, triggering my brain to acknowledge that it had the jokes I have ever wanted. The dark humors were fascinating, though they were what I could imagine.However, it was such a good time to have seen a show with numerous of it and not being awkward but cheerful.Hope it can get its second season and things can continue with their unique vibes.",10
North America,"Every episode was addictive, so much so that I watched all 8 before I went to bed. The actors did a great job, the plot is mostly smooth, but don't expect this to be a childrens series, you will be very shocked later on that this series sometimes has Rated R material. The Hyde was a very menacing monster that gave me the shivers, that design is really creepy. The monster works best in a dark environment but later on, it shows that the CGI is low quality. Don't get me started with thos transformations because they are really noticeably bad. Other than the poor CGI, this show is a must watch! I don't reccomend children to watch this show.",8
North America,"The first thing that struck me was the brother being locked up in the lockers and began crying because of it. The sad part is he enjoys pain, and torture. So he would actually enjoy what happen to him. It's really a show that lives off the fake idea that girls are stronger the boys. It's a weak story and bland one at that. Bad casting and how's her father that Hispanic and she doesn't hav one characteristics of being Hispanic.It's a bad wanna be Adam's family spin off and personally want My time back. If I had a case I'd sue Netflix for destroying my child with this horrible show.Give credit to anyone who can sit and watching nightmare.",2
North America,"Don't really know where the bad critics are coming from. This show is amazing, coming from an Addams Family fan! I see complaints about not enough Tim Burton, but I see Tim Burton everywhere! I want more of this! I need at least 6 more seasons. The darkness of Wednesday Addams is brought with both humor and real, deep and strong emotions. I have ASD and recognize parts of myself in her. Not sure if that was the intention though but for me it gives me all the more reason to love this show. They managed to build her character way beyond the Wednesday from the movies and I find that a great accomplishment considering she was never the main character.",10
North America,"The departure of Tim Burton as the director past the first 4 episodes was quite clearly felt, the show started looking and feeling a lot more like the average netflix series, Burton has such a nice eye for set design and despite the rest of the series still having the same visuals they aren't framed quite as well nor adhered to as much.The performances all around were very good, the characters are well written and there are satisfying arcs for all the main players, i especially liked the main friendship dynamic between Wednesday and Enid, Thing was also really good i didn't expect a disembodied hand to be among the best characters in the show.The show does fall apart somewhat in the last two episodes and i think it's a problem that is way more prominent here because the show isn't released weekly but all at once, so when binge watching it, the twists of the plot very quickly feel like a muddled and hurried along mess. Like she's just wildly throwing around accusations and it just seemed completely dumb and a little out of character with how tight lipped and secretive she had been up untill then. The show also feels very Harry Potter-esque and in the last episode it went from feeling inspired by to basically coming across like a Harry Potter fanfic with some OC characters.Hope to see another season in the future, because while it wasn't perfect the show had me invested in the story and all of its characters.",8
North America,"As a life long fan devotee of Charles Addam's creepy and kooky family, I will be very judgmental of every adaptation that comes our way, and I have to say this mysterious and spooky series is amazing.Jenna Ortega shines as the oldest Addams' daughter, it's almost as if she was born to play the child of woe. Ortega transformation into Wednesday seems effortless, she has all the quirks, coldness and mean insults associated with her, but in such an expert hands, Wednesday does not seem cartoonish nor one-dimensional, she is portrayed with incredible depth.The series is also directed by Tim Burton, and his love for the macabre and Hammer Horror us incredibly noticeable here, and so is his dark sense of humor.The supporting cast is incredible as well, specially Emma Myers as Enid, her colorful personality are a surprisingly well match for our color deprived protagonist.If you were a fan of Wednesday Addams before you will love the series, id the character is new to you this series will make you fall for her.A Gothic murder mystery with a twist of irreverent dark humor, there are not enough words to praise this series.",10
North America,"So... is this directed by THE Tim Burton, or is it a guy with the same name? This is annoyingly bad.1) The story is incoherent
2) The dialogues sound unnatural
3) The acting.... Like a b movie to say the least
4) Direction: doesn't look like burton, it is really sloppy
5) childish cinematography, every scene uses a very shallow depth of field, again, really Tim?6) special effects look fake
7) the jokes.... There are no jokes. You can tell there were supposed to be from the punch lines, on which you don't laugh.Maybe this series should be promoted to children, under the age of 10?Very disappointing result from one of my favorite directors.",1
North America,"Not sure why there are such good reviews here. Some of them genuinely seem fake. This show was really poor me and my partner like Tim Burton and the Addams family so expected something good here. Its neither got Tim burton's gothic style or any remote feeling of the Addams family. Wednesday is just mean with no fun qualities, Pugsley is a wimp, and Gomez and Mortisha keep mumbling their lines so god knows what their characters are like. Then they got rid of the family and put Wednesday in Hogwarts with even worse characters with even worse CGI. Jeez, we really wanted to enjoy this but quickly saw it was just a big cash grab by Netflix trying to create a new Harry Potter franchise. Don't waste your time.",1
North America,"Honestly the show is fantastic, I wasn't aware of it coming and but when I seen it I thought it will be typical Addams family show but we got soo much more.While some people may want to see the rest of the family you need to keep in mind the show focuses on Wednesday and her journey.Honestly the humour and horror is perfectly balanced where we really get to enjoy the show. The costumes are phenomenal and the crew did a great job on them.As to the story it moves at a great pace and is really interesting leaving you wanting more.Tim Burton really added his creative touch to this series and I can only hope this will be a long running series as the possibilities are endless as to where they can take the story. I hope it runs for a good few year with many seasons.But I must say Jenna Ortega is absolutely perfect as Wednesday. Her acting is absolutely perfect and she captures the character like no other. To be fair all of the cast are acting really well which makes the show all that more enjoyable.Highly recommend the show and hope to see more seasons in the future!",10
North America,"9 stars for Ortega. 10 stars for her delightful greyscale wardrobe. 5 stars for plot. ~7 stars overall.Ortega (Wednesday), Myers (Enid), and ""Thing"" are mostly delightful in their roles. The rest of the cast are adequate to forgettable. It was good to see Ricci in a supporting role, even though her appearances were few. This Uncle Fester was a bit off, but at least he showed up.This teen version of Wednesday is fun & more nuanced than Ricci's, but the overall tone of the show unfortunately doesn't go as ""dark"" as it could have. There were 2 moments when I nearly laughed, and only a few smiles along the way.You'd hardly know Wednesday is at a boarding SCHOOL, as she's in class about 60 seconds total. The vamps do nothing, and the rest of the kids barely show their creature-natures.",7
North America,"Jenna Ortega has knocked this one out of the park! The whole series is amazing! Fingers crossed for a second! The casting as a whole has been very good. I would like to see more Uncle Fester if there is another series or even a stand alone Fester series. The storyline keeps you gripped with a whos done it and then very clever pulls it all together. Keep watching don't google the spoilers. There are some nods to the original movies throughout the series which was a good touch! Again though the portrayal of Wednesday was just perfect, she's definitely on for some awards after this. Must watch!!!",10
North America,"Honestly I was a bit judgy in the beginning but wow. Tim Burton is still the man I see. This was perfect in every way shape and form. It's takes a minute to adjust because remember this is only about Wednesday, this is her adventures. But with the right touch a Addams still. This is the best. Season 2 better come quickly because I'm salivating for more. Honestly they had the best scenes that showed her truly as we remember her, heartless and stone cold, but this gave her a different side. And emotional one. The actress that they chose, pure gold. This girl had a bright future ahead of her, as I have seen her on some other shows. Just perfection. Absolute perfection. I will tell you as I told my snap chat, this was a chefs kiss.",10
North America,"This is what I would call regressed preppy: it's safe, insular and fluffy yet violent, erotic and toxic, that thing where it simultaneously feels like a very young children's tv show AND an X-rated movie. A very jarring experience with continuous whiplash, just totally caught off guard by the combination. It's Spongebob Squarepants meets Freddy Kruger.It's like being immersed in an identity crisis, wanting to be perceived as sweet, soft, and innocent yet that repressed wild side and agenda can't help but peek through. It makes for a very calculated experience which is totally unimmersive.For example, you can just tell that they used White coded passing bullies in that overcorrection/overcompensating 'see, we're not biased' way. Then you can see how they specifically, actively, put a Black coded passing bully for another scene as a way to balance it out and/or stick to their comfortable biased routine.Or how the characters keep emphasizing how ""white"" Wednesday is which is just poorly cloaked Casteism. Wednesday might as well ask a mirror 'who the fairest of them all' is.Then you have the questionable romance/social plots which almost seem to normalize or glorify toxic behavior. You know, rude for no reason, zero empathy yet is still supposed to be likable and is liked by others or insta-love type of stuff. It's starting to become disturbing and not in a good way.Other than that it's just very predictable and flat entertainment due to the approach: the lore, tone and aesthetic is just superficial wrapping on another typical teen drama with flat trope characters and identity cult propaganda. The Woman cultism was in full effect: Men are 2D-evil except love interest(s), perfect female protagonist has unlimited skills, abilities and knowledge and wispy/waify/skinny character with little to no muscle tone can beat up anyone, typically a male.The over reliance on formula is also clear, I mean, a werewolf character that says 'This kitty has claws'? Just because it has been used successfully before in other media and vaguely correlates? Since when were (retractable) claws the weapons of werewolves? Fangs would of made more sense or why not just make them say 'This puppy has claws' or make them a Werecat? Instead they just put tropes, cliches and formulas in a blender without a lid and used whatever flew out. It can also been seen in how Wednesday literally talks in wry, sarcastic, macabre come backs. We're talking 95% of Wednesday's lines and that is zero exaggeration.Lastly, the exposition. Why are you using all of the dialogue to explain to the audience what is currently happening right in front of our faces? Dialogue is there to weave a story and express characters, not to talk down to us.This IS just a magic mirror for the matching demographic (light featured, dainty, logical/socialite Women and the 'Latinx' Women/Other Women that aspire to be them) which is what all shows are becoming, 'chosen one' simulators. At least if it wasn't your vibe or matching demographic it was watchable but now it's just so bludgeoning, obstructive and exclusionary.If you're the matching demographic you may enjoy it and why not as I said most demographics seem to be doing it but what happened to stories, character flaws, and creativity instead of risk-free formulas, decadent self worship and identity cult propaganda?",2
North America,"I have grown watching adams family in black and white,amazing,my favourite character was Wednesday,the actress is a Wednesday,but the show not,i watch it till the end,waiting to see something that Wednesday is ,her apathy,all what Wednesday was,but she is not an Investigator,its like harry potter,thats what that show is,the uncle looks so stupid here,even the father,i hope if there will be,a second seazon,will not look like this,shame for what Wednesday was,if people grown as i did,with the idea that adams family was,in black and white,will be disappointed,younger generation may like it,sorry Netflix,you screw another great story..",3
North America,"As someone who grow up and adores the Addams Family, this was an interesting concept. It's not the most amazing thing I've seen, but it's not terribly awful either.I was happy when I saw Christina Ricci was in this, she is always great. I enjoyed her character. Jenna Ortega was awesome as Wednesday, she understood the assignment and nailed it. A+Catherine Zeta-Jones as Morticia, no this was not a good choice at all even with her only in two episodes. Luis Guzman as Gomez, why? Again this was NOT a smart casting decision. There was zero chemistry between these two, it was just weird and awkward to watch. They felt so out of place compared to the rest of cast.Thing was a delight as per usual. He has always been my favourite character. I enjoy his updated look. Christopher Lloyd will always be my number one Fester, but Fred Armisen was still decent. The rest of the cast did a good job and played their characters well.At times, it doesn't have the same feel as other Tim Burton classics. The reason for this is because some episodes are not directed by Burton. However, the episodes with Tim, you can absolutely tell it's him. The CGI was good but not spectacular. The story was interesting and humorous. I was laughing at Wednesday's statements quite often. Also, the dance scene was epic!The soundtrack is fun and definitely feels more like Tim Burton. One of my favourite scenes was when Wednesday played Paint it Black on the cello. I love the cello and had goosebumps, it was so beautiful to listen to.I rate this 8/10. It was worth watching, I didn't feel like I wasted my time. It left me wanting more. It is geared more towards teens, but adults like myself will enjoy it too. I would gladly watch a second season. My only desire is that if this does get a second season, that they cast different actors to play Morticia and Gomez.",8
North America,"This is an amazing spin off of the original Addams Family. The visuals are amazing and it is one of the best Netflix shows. Jenna Ortega and Emma Meyers do an amazing job and made the show vivid and are one with their characters.The script is a bit off somehow - it feels like it's a forced on the main characters. Side plots are not getting anywhere, and the characters have to act a certain way that is more focused on the story rather than their own motives.I am also not entirely sold on the characters and portrayal of Morticia and Gomez - it is different than the original movies and story. There is no chemistry, and the characters' looks are off (based on the original description).Nevertheless, if you don't compare and watch it as a show on it's own, it is a very good. I laughed, I broke down, it is overall a very entertaining series.",8
North America,"They definitely do a second seasonStory , acting , all was amazingThe actors and dialogs also perfect

North America,"The 8 episode show gives you insight on what Wednesday Addams life is like in High School. The mix of combined spooky vibes, character portrayal and mystery really makes you want to watch all 8 episodes in one sitting. I absolutely loved this series, I think Jenna Ortega did a phenomenal job of portraying the iconic Wednesday we all love. She gave an authentic depiction of the character as she grows up. The setting and plot were perfect, you really get attached to the characters and the plot of the series. If you want to watch a really good, funny, mysterious binge worthy show, I highly recommend.",10
North America,"When I found out that ortega, was gonna play as wendsday. I was excited! Everyone was too! And couldn't wait to watch it. When it finally released I watched it, seeing the actors and the details like the mansion and the personality of everyone on the screen it was enduringly GOOD. The camera shots and the lighting was perfect, and jenna ortega fits brilliantly in Tim Burton Wensday and gotta say the CGI wasn't as great as I hoped like some shots looks good but most of the time it looked not so good. For example the monster CGI looked like it came from the mask movie from the 19s. But watch anyway.",8
North America,"Don t know what has happened here? Tim Burton was part of this ?? As far as next stupid Netflix production does not surprise me, still in shock that T. B was involved in this.. and to leave a review here I need to have 600 signs... Jeez... Oki, so what else can I write, not funny at all, the history was not interesting at all, apart from some scene, it suppose to be movie for 10 years old. Music was ok, and probably the best part of this. Actors - nothing special, dialogues... ???! Was there at least one apart dialogue there???? No? 8 episodes and found 0 nice comments, the last episode the worst one. Wow finally 600 signs...",2
North America,"This is good stuff.The first few chapters are best, but the whole thing is real good.They nailed the casting and respected the Addams legacy.It's dark-ish, funny and entertaining all along.If anything, feels a little bit short, one or two episodes short. That's how good it is; no fillers, and you are left wanting a little bit more.There is just as much explanation as required, enough info to round up the characters and make you care about them,...
I won't spoil it, but the ending leaves you with a small hint of sadness. And that's good, because it means it made you care about it.The door for another season is left open.The novelty will be gone by then, as well as all the introductory arc where we and the rest of characters get to know Wednesday.They'll have a hard time topping this one. Here's for hoping they give it a go.Well done you!",9
North America,"Bit of a snoozer. It seems like the producers, writers, or powers that may (or may not) be, hung their hat on one character of what was an ensemble cast show back in the day. That's not to say that I was a fan of the old show, I'd seen it when I was young, but to me they took the prominent aspects of one character, accentuated them, and then tried to plug a storyline that could have worked with a recreation/adaption of any old tv show or movie that addresses or even abutted the strange, magical or supernatural world.In sum, the storyline might work on its own, or accompanied by a better backstory, but it ultimately fell short for.Also found it a bit immature.",3
North America,"I can't imagine a more perfect casting for Wednesday. The plot is a little hard to follow and people expecting this to be an Addams Family reboot will not be happy, but the show stands on its own. It's enjoyable and unique and definitely worth the watch if only for Ortega's performance. The cinematography is beautiful as well, everything is catered around Wednesday, so she stands out in every scene, even in a school full of ""outcasts"". I especially enjoyed the juxtaposition between Wednesday and her bubbly roommate. People who enjoyed Charlie and The Chocolate Factory and Series of Unfortunate Events will love this show.",9
North America,"It sounds strange, but the original Addams Family and the movies from the early 90s have heart - this does not seem to exist here.It is difficult to portray a character that was perfectly portrayed already, but I'm not sure if it is Ortega's doing or if this is how the part was written or how she was directed. Ricci's Wednesday wasn't self-absorbed or angst-ridden, she was part of the family unit and wasn't constantly out to prove herself. She was already confident and didn't need to be rude or defensive. She was mature beyond her years. She didn't want to die, she was interested in death.And while I know this show is focused on the one character, I find the absence of the family-first value we got in the earlier renditions of the Addams' to be off-putting.Maybe it's just not for someone of my generation, we already had our Wednesday Addams, and this one is just too hateful.",1
North America,"I had high hopes going in since I'm a huge fan of Cristina Ricci, Jenna Ortega and Catherine Zeta-Jones and Wednesday did not disappoint! It was a well-crafted and imaginative series that kept me guessing until the final episode! I grew up watching the original Addam's Family Series on reruns as well as the cartoons so was very happy to see that the new series stayed truer to the original cartoon depictions of the characters. I was nervous that it would be too similar Chilling Adventures of Sabrina given the setting at Nevermore Academy but was happy that it was just a dark yet possessed more dark humor and emotion than the Sabrina series. Fingers crossed that there will be a season 2 and beyond!",9
North America,"A great watch. Tim Burton has created a masterpiece series.Amazon and the Rings of Power creators should take note - Now, this is how you adapt a beloved, established IP.Well acted and a gripping story that unfolds across 8 episodes. Likeable new characters and a respectful rendition of the characters we know and love. Jenna Ortega and Emma Myers shine as our main protagonists but the whole supporting cast did a stellar job.The visuals and the music were also top-notch.You can tell that everyone involved poured their love into this project and it shows. Well done to all involved.Can't wait for a season 2 and I hope it lives up to this season.",9
North America,"Nice surprise, and gets better after a couple of episodes and the expectations of a classics Addams family story.Actually, this is more of a Addams Family meets Harry Potter, with lots of elements that hint on the atmosphere of a Hogwarts-like setting - the school, students divided into groups/houses, the peculiar headmaster, and so on...
Very nice show that deserves a watch.The nice touches given by Tim Burton are obviously a plus, such as having Christina Ricci in the cast (which makes us be constantly looking for the Wednesday in her).The plotline is pretty decent as well, even though the script is not a masterpiece...it is quite gripping.",9
North America,"How anyone can rate this highly I will never understand. The dialogue is so terrible that it makes the brilliant cast seem like terrible actors. If Tim Burton wanted to make Harry Potter movie then he should have done that. This is a huge failure of his attempt at that. I'm surprised that he directed the first four episodes. The cinematography is flat and boring. Nothing looks good or has any style to it. After four episodes I'm giving up. How this has an 8 rating is baffling. It's one of the worst things Tim Burton has done and the absolute worst thing Netflix has put out, which is saying a lot. I truly hope this does not get another season.",3
North America,"Once in a while a show comes along on there that I go wow... yes, this is what I am paying for. Now give me more. The season is contained but short. Ortega's Wednesday is exceptional, you will grow to love her and her supporting cast. The music and scenes set a great tone... (yes, I am listening to APOCALYPTICA: Nothing Else Matters as I write this)It's dark, with some clever word play to give it a lighter tone at times as a nod to the older shows but...it's not a comedy. Regardless, It kept me engaged right to the end and I look forward to more. I'd love to see a bit longer seasons...A binge worthy endeavor on the part of Burton and crew. They have done a masterful job with this series.",9
North America,I get that this is supposed to be a different universe and a darker version but I dislike that Wednesday resents Morticia. The point of the Addams Family is that they are a loving family dispite being creepy. I feel like that's the one line you don't cross. Also the CGI is really bad. The set up doesn't make sense to me. Pugsley was tied up and shoved into a locker. If he is an Addams shouldn't he enjoy being tortured. Also it was too cartoonish for normies to do it feels like something an Addams would do. I also don't care for what they did to Wednesday's. She went from deadpan to rude know it all. I know it's a different version but I just don't care for it. The pun game and quips we're on point though.,5
North America,"The best villains are relatable and fleshed out characters, not boring psychopaths that just run around terrorizing the townsfolk because they're supposed to as 'the bad guys'. But we'll get to that.First I gotta say: as a detective, Wednesday Addams comes across looking like a bonehead more often than I'd like.She stumbles through the series getting next to nothing right and constantly endangering her friends along the way, many of whom deserved more screen time than they got.And alas, the eventual payoff of the big reveal very nearly doesn't warrant the investment. Since at that point it wasn't much of a reveal, and it sacrifices some well-rounded characters by turning them into rote villains, wasting the effort put into their backstories in the first place.Jenna Ortega and her costars had a lot of work to do to make up for the shortcomings of the writing, yet while it is a near thing, they did manage to pull it off.7/10 Stars. I wouldn't say no to a second season, but I won't go looking for it any time soon.",7
North America,"It's the Addam's Family adapted for a target audience who wouldn't have liked the original Addams Family and I don't get why would anyone write and market a tv show around characters that don't fit the story that is gonna be told.I'm saying that because I've read a lot of comments from viewers afraid of watching this because they heard that Adams were kinda horror movie characters (which they aren't).It turned out like a cheap, generic Harry Potter mixed with a personality lacking Wednesday Addams. I hope to see Jena Ortega in other, more interesting roles, though, she's great! I'm not sure it will get another season.",3
North America,"Oh i am so utterly obsessed with this show! Wednesday is EVERYTHING! And don't even get me started on her character development because my god did that make me an emotional mess. Love how realistically painfully slow it happened too, it was so bittersweet to watch. The plot twist towards the end, which i was deep down fearing though, stung a tiny bit since i was really into that whole part of the show too and was rooting for wednesday but it's making me even more excited for a second season which is hopefully happening! Special mention to the very likeable characters of edin and eugene and of course thing!! <3.",10
North America,"Alright. First things first: yes, the dialogue can be pretty bad at times, for a couple different reasons. The dialogue between the students can be a little off, but Gen Z is a hard demographic to write for if you're not us. I get that, so I give it a pass.The other reason I can see people disliking the writing for this show is the campiness (a.k.a. Corniness). I personally didn't have an issue, as I feel like that's still pretty true to the Addams' Family tone.Now, for the stuff I feel is good. Firstly, hats absolutely off to the casting crew; y'all did fantastic. I don't think there was a bad performance in here (maybe with the exception of Luis Guzmán, but he still did okay). Jenny Ortega was brilliant as Wednesday and I can't think of a better actor after having watched.The set design was absolutely wonderful, specifically within Nevermore. I do also love the juxtaposition of a vaulted-ceiling castle with small town America; I feel it adds a good contrast and reasoning for some character decisions.The soundtrack and score bring a brilliant mix of classical, macabre, haunting to a fundamentally teen story, with good taste in song choice to match.The general plot and mystery of the whole season gripped me. There was a solid mix of clues that let you hypothesize and try to solve it alongside Wednesday, both from maguffins and cinematic cues. It kept me guessing the whole time, and questioning when things didn't necessarily line up. Overall, a genuinely satisfying mystery to watch unravel.I loved this show, and I'll be waiting with baited breath.",9
North America,From the start I thought I was watching a Slytherin character at a spin-off Hogwarts school but all in all the show goes well from start to finish with a nice witty character dialogue I found myself giggling at time to time listening to their conversations and Wednesdays need for a negative view on everything.my over all experience was met with satisfaction and I'm left wanting more season 2 please. It Would be nice to have more off the family the Addams gatherings. I was not sure if I would enjoy this but I was wrong in the end the show holds up well the acting is strong on all parts the cinematography is top notch.,7
North America,"I havent seen a better use of symbolism in any modern tv show. This show has an amazing storyline, characters, and intrigue. My main and only complaint was with the actor choice for Gomez Addams and Morticia Addams I dont think they were the best actors for the job and just did not do the trick for me, even though I do find Luis Guzmán to be a magnificent actor and i do think a mexican american actor would suit the role best, I dont think he suit the on screen gomez vibe of the late and great Raul Julia, But none the less he did a good job. The portrial of Wednesday by Jenna Ortega was abosutely magnificent.",10
North America,"I'm not sure if the people who rated and reviewed it watched the entire series in its entirety, yet. I'm wondering if the rave reviews and ratings are more for initial half of the season. I can say that I have watched it in its entirety and I would say it's between a 6 to 7 out of 10 with 10 being best. I was excited that the people behind Smallville TV show got together with Tim Burton to make this. Unfortunately, Tim Burton only directed first half of season and that's about the only part of the season that was most engaging to watch.The writing quality is uneven. It starts out strong first half which is important to first engage the audience, but fell kinda flat and drawn out after the first half of the season. I definitely feel the whole storyline could have been condensed to like 6 episodes instead of 8 without sacrificing quality. It's like show production got rushed and the writing got lazier from middle to end.Jenna Ortega's performance as Wednesday is the best part about the show truly. I've seen her in ""Scream 5"" and ""You"" playing similar characters that it's refreshing to see her show more versatility, showcasing her talent and acting range as a more different character.Spoiler from here down: It's one of those cases where as a viewer you figure out who's dunnit and becomes exhausting when Wednesday has pretty much exhausted all avenues before figuring out who's dunnit. It got annoying and my patience wore thin. And seemed like filler to draw the show out to have more unecessary episodes than it needed to have at the sacrifice in quality. By the time I realize the show quality goes downhill from here it's like I'm in it too deep to not finish at this point and I can't think of any other show I'd rather watch instead cuz I've felt like I've exhausted everything worth watching at this point. I also got annoyed when certain characters make stupid, obvious mistakes like for example a character turning their back on the villain they know is still there because their distracted by the villain killing a major character. While this level of stupidity of the characters is not unique to just this show, it's still annoyingly obvious and a sad attempt to add suspense and thrill in the moment and is a trope. Back turning against the bad guy happened about twice in the same episode.I would watch a second season. It's watchable. I do think because it's drawn out some people are gonna give up about about 5-6 episodes in cuz quality goes down from there and it gets a little boring and drawn out and the show doesn't quite redeem itself even with the conclusion of the mystery.It's got a similar feel to CW's Nancy Drew but lacks villain of the week and more villain of the season arc, but with better quality story initially and a lack of gratuitous sex scenes.",7
North America,"Wow i wasn't expecting to like this show so much since it was my most anticipated show to watch on Netflix and Jenna Ortega killed it as Wednesday Addams ! I love how dark but funny it is and i couldn't believe tyler was the hyde and that Laurel was Alive , i need a season 2 because it was that good of a show and Christina Ricci killed it as Marilyn Thornhill and Laurel Gates . I wasn't expecting to enjoy this show so much!!!! Go watch this show everyone because it'll leave you wanting more of Christina Ricci 's character and wanting a second season ................ I definitely recommend this show .....",10
North America,"Was sceptical at first on how they would make a hole season about my favourite character but I was amazed on how they did it. Jenna plays Wednesday so great, loved the whole story line. Tim Burton has done an amazing job of expanded on Wednesday character and who she is. Would love to see a second season about this. Definitely recommend. Was just great watching Wednesday grow as a person, how she was finding out more about her self and family. How her minds works and her abiltiy to be so detached from everything and everyone around her and yet making attachments at the same time was just great.",10
North America,"This show is by far one of the best Netflix has released in the past years. It certainly is my new favorite show! The characters are perfect, the acting is great and the storyline is entertaining and mystical. The CGI of the monster could have been better but it does suit the theme. The villain arc was predictable but still an absolute 10/10. Jenna played Wednesday insanely good and Enid, in my opinion, deserves even more screen time in season 2! Enid is just as interesting of a character as Wednesday is - great writers and show producers. The suspense is killing me indeed. Can't wait for season 2.",10
North America,"Wednesday joins school and is instantly great at everything, there is no heartless evil, no confrontation, there is just a mild competitiveness with the other children.... Previous incarnations of Wednesday would have tortured the room mate on the first day, turned psychiatrist mad and have burnt down the school... the actor looks the part and speaks amazingly but the character is simply just a mildly gothic person at school, nothing moreIf they are going to put out other seasons, they need to find better writers to make it more ruthless... have better one-line come-backs and less meaningless conversations to prove how Wednesday is better than other characters... lose the silly love interests and have consequences for people who challenge Wednesday.",6
North America,"When I saw the trailer for this series announced, it gave me a jolt of joy. Not least since I saw the films from the 1990's. And not being American I'd have seen the original series later.Now of course it would have been greater if Anjelica Huston had been in the role of Morticia, but all in all - not a bad choice in casting.The series is full of choice morsels of beloved quotes that fit the plot like a glove, and the masterful hands of Tim Burton is pure pleasure to watch.Actually I would love to, and I do believe quite a few would agree with me that it has an almost Harry Potter'ish quality over it.I am looking forward to the next season.",9
North America,"I enjoyed watching this so much. Tim Burton as always made an amazing job combining the mystery plot and fairytales. The jokes are funny and gloomy, really the ""Addams""style. I liked so much the irony of Christina Ricci playing ""Thornhill"" (don't wanna be a spoiler, so just watch the movie :D), since I personally adore her as Wednesday Addams, she played this role brilliantly (of course Jenna Ortega is also made a great job, very talented girl). Can't wait to see new episodes as soon as possible! I know that the story is concentrated on Wednesday, but hope that there will be a little bit more of all Addams, since they all have so noticeable personalities, it will bring more sparkles to the plot.",9
North America,"This is not your Wednesday Addams from the Adam family movies. Think more of Gothic version of Harriet Spy goes to Monster High. Ricci even playing a different character still steals the show.I thought the movie was be Wednesday, dealing with the teenage years, and learning to live in a society where she is the outcast. Instead we get werewolves, vampires, shape shifters and all sorts of past story line of the Adams that we were never told about. And we learn about a new ability the Adamas family have, which has never even hinted at it.Fun show but it not a classic like the movies. Made to compete with Monster High?",7
North America,"Such a great show. The dark sarcastic humour is very well delivered, I constantly burst into laughter. Episode one has a fantastic colour palette. I love the music, characters, acting and the dialogue is on point.The acting is so good, Wednesday casting is excellent, I want more of Nevermore. Love the story, twist and turns, good pacing.This is why I love TV series, we get to discover new talents and new gem such as this.Unlike block buster movies where you get stuck with the same famous stars for almost every movie. And if they're rich they'll cast themselves as the lead in their own movie :p, TV series has new actors/actress breathing life into new character, making them unique & memorable.Looking forward to season 2.",10
North America,"My family absolutely LOVE the Addams Family. However i'm not as big a fan as them, but i absolutely loved this show.Jenna Ortega was 100% the best person for this, every role she plays is perfect.Tim did an amazing job with everything: the costumes, the camera work, the characters depth and improvement, the plot twists everything is on point.And the fact that the original Wednesday Addams is in the movie (the redhead normie teacher) makes it even better.The fact that Wednesday never blinked in the entire show is amazing acting, Jenna really outdid herself with this.Even the side characters have you gripped into the story.",9
North America,"I have never done a review before, but this series is so good I've felt the need.Wednesday is witty, clever and resourceful. I'm in awe of how this series has been funny yet inspiring for many young girls and I hope it inspires girls to be more independent and trust themselves.I have literally loved every single minute of this series and I'm about to watch it again already.The music and instrumental incorporation is the icing on the cake, I can't praise this enough.I won't give any spoilers away but the cello solo towards of the end of the first episode absolutely mesmerised me.Please give the green light for the second season as I'm dying for more!",10
North America,"I expected this to be another typical failed reboot full of identity politics beating viewers over the head. There is some of it to be sure, but it was minimal and tolerable.My main complaint is Gomez felt miscast. I read that Tim Burton wanted to cast a shorter fatter actor as this was how the character was originally written. Luis Guzman is a great character actor when playing gangsters, but the hoodrat vibes just felt out of place. Also uncle Fester was annoying. For some reason he was portrayed as jewish saying things like ""oy vey"". It made no sense.Those things aside, it was a joy to watch the actress playing Wednesday and her deadpan delivery.",8
North America,"First off we go from Raul Julia to some fat ugly guy for Gomez. This is just wrong. You are supposed to believe that Gomez and Morticia are madly in love, not in some twisted guilt ridden relationship based on something horrible that happened when they were in school. Gomez has always been played by athletic, good looking and suave men who you can believe would land an incredible woman like Morticia. Not some fat slothful looser who looks like he will pass out from climbing a flight of stairs.Second, Pugsley is not some weak child. He isn't a victim type who gets bullied. He is tougher than that. He isn't insecure or mewling. He has Wednesday for an older sister. Bullies should run from him in terror.This is the big issue I see with this show, the men have all been castrated and are waiting for women to tell them what to do. Blech.",1
North America,"Because while I liked it I didn't love it! This would have been something I would of liked to take my daughter to see when she was a tween, I didn't really like how any of the Adams were cast whilst Catherine Zeta Jones looked amazing she was hit or miss in her acting. I love Luis Guzman but don't think that was a part he was really suited for and the guy who played uncle Fester( don't know his name) was awful! And as for Wednesday(Jenna Ortega) I wasn't thrilled with her! Her acting is very one note. Christina Rcci was much better as was the cast of the 90's movie. Any ways this was entertaining enough. The costumes, filming etc was done well and I did enjoy it. It's a decent watch for the evening and much better than most of the recent series releases on netflix.",7
North America,"Things have not been great from the Netflix camp of late, so wasn't sure what to expect, but have to say Tim Burtons 'Wednesday' has certainly given me hope that we may see some actual series worth watching on it once more. It was funny, emotional, dark and really good fun. Let's hope Tim Burton stays on board for the 2nd series (which there definitely will be, but wont spoil things if mot watched it yet) because I will definitely be watching it. The actress who played Wednesday was the perfect actress to play the part and the CGI for Thing was just superb. Personally I don't think I would have picked Catherine Zeta Jones as Morticia, but will let that slide, because of everyone else's fantastic performances.",9
North America,"The list of genres for this production should include ""mystery"" as the first one. This show is a crazy fun time and, while the family saw only two shows on Thanksgiving Day, my wife and myself binged the entire eight episodes on our own.Typically Tim Burton is known for his odd take on cinema and this work is simply superb...most everything seems plausible regardless of how it's portrayed.Excellent screenplay. Excellent acting. The entire production team should be awarded Oscars.Jenna Ortega is priceless and has captured her character Wednesday perfectly. Her demeanor reminds me of Arnold Schwarzenegger as the Terminator.",8
North America,"Without Jenny Ortegas performance as Wednesday, there would be little to recommend other then a semi interesting central mystery. The rest of the show is insufferable characters like Wednesdays roommate, Xavier, and Tyler. Watching Tyler act makes my eyes and ears bleed.When the central mystery is not the main focus, we have to suffer through the typical YA teen agnst drama. The target audience for this show will soak it up. If you ever thought Riverdale was a good show you will be right at home here. Hence the 8.5 on imdb.Wednesday might as well be another CW show, rotten tomatoes said it the best. If CW type drama, writing, characters is your thing you will love Wendesday. To each their own. I prefer a little bit more substance in my television shows.",5
North America,"Didn't know what to expect. Vague memories of the reruns of the original show when I was very young. Think I saw the first movie with because of my little sisters and was never a fan. Put this on because I was bored. It is absolutely brilliant. Each character is fully realised and Wednesday is fantastic. Yes, I knew who the baddies were by the 5th episode but it didn't matter because I believe it was intentional as the writers were continuing to so us that Wednesday was very intelligent and mature but also cocky and naive too. Very well done.How this show could come from the crap origins I remember is a testament to the writers and producers. Applause all round. Watch it!",10
North America,"I knew I was going to like this reincarnated version of Charles Addams' story of Wednesday during the series' first episode when Jenna Ortega, as the titular teen states: ""I find social media to be a soul-sucking void of meaningless affirmation."" She'll get no argument from me on that point. Apparently (and I hadn't known this), Tim Burton was the director originally attached (as they say in the ""business known as show"") to The Addams Family movies, but couldn't make it work with his Batman movies' post-production schedules. I don't know if the eventual director, Barry Sonnenfeld, was 100% responsible for the original casting of Christina Ricci, or if Burton had a role (he would use her in later films like ""Sleepy Hollow""), but the young actress created a memorable if not iconic character in two films. And she gets a nice, if light supporting role here. So why this series? Well it's now literally a new generation with an updated sense of cynicism and sarcasm, plus we've got to give Tim Burton his time at bat, don't we? He doesn't disappoint. And neither does Jenna Ortega's turn in the role of Wednesday (Full of Woe) Addams. I refer you to the dance scene in episode four. Memorable, once again. If I could award halfs, then the series would be 8.5/10 stars.",8
North America,"I loved this show- I really did, but I also did not appreciate all the liberal micro aggressions . It's too bad that all the new shows and movies that are made these days always have to have left liberals and their loonatic microagressive propaganda. So much is lost with the passive aggressive slips that take away from what could be awesome and wonderful to watch. There were so many things I really enjoyed about this series- but alas, too much was dedicated to the liberals and their demise of wellness. Sad that this is the new truth, but maybe someday it will get old and people can get over their agendas and go back to making good movies and shows.",5
North America,"Omg! I have been excited about this series for a few months and I was sooooo happy when it dropped on Netflix on Wednesday. I grew up watching different versions of the Addams Family and I of course love love the one with Christina Ricci in it. How cool was it that she's one of the main stars in this series!. Good to see Catherine Zeta-Jones and Luis Guzmàn, Gwendoline Christie from Game of Thrones always great to see her in character. Jenna Ortega was greatt playing Wednesday Addams!!. I liked the who school theme, Bianca was my 2nd favorite character. I'm 37 and I really enjoyed this. S2 please!!",10
North America,"As my first experience with any addams family work it was a great start, the series is super fun and addictive, you can't stop watching, endearing and relatable people, fun story, although in the last 4 episodes the quality has dropped a bit little, great direction by Tim Burton with an amazing finale with many reveals and an absurdly good final episode, and a cliffhanger at the end of the series for more seasons [The end. ?""songs, comedy, wednesday being cold, gothic and dark brighten my 7 hours of consumption of the series, along with several cool characters, Emma Myers as Enid was excellent, in addition to the entire cast that was incredible, very good series!",8
North America,"I cannot describe how in love I am with the whole story line, concept and actors. This is hands down one of the best shows I have watched in a long time and I really need more seasons. It's a totally new and fresh idea, which is literally suitable for so many age ranges to watch - I binged the whole show in 2 days! Best show on Netflix at the moment and definitely will be for a long time! It's like the movie but a million times better, with new in depth characters and stories! I really do hope they renew it for a new season and soon because I cannot wait!! A must watch for anyone wanting something new to binge!",10
North America,"Told from the start to the end, not 2 episodes of story and 6 episodes of flashbacks and backstories, not drawn out, not artifically stretched and convoluted, just a story with lovable characters, mixing the Addams lore with a huge chunk of Harry Potter and another one right from the old vampire slayer Buffy.I normally hate high school drama and the endless parade of 25-30 year old ""teenagers"" that have completely taken over every genre I used to like, so I'm positively surprised by this, especially since I've grown to fear overblown marketed series, but not just Burton and Elfman and the all-star ensemble deliver, but pretty much everyone on the set and behind it.Is it the bestest thing ever? Well, the bestest thing in this category for a while at least. It's funny, full of little twists, a little scary, quite mysterious and never really what you would expect, which is exactly what you'd expect from something with the Addams name.",9
North America,I don't even know why bother using the Addams family if all they wanted to make was yet another teen mystery drama.Netflix used their old bad recipe once again and they basically ticked all the boxes for a tv show that covers every genres.It's a teen murder mystery comedy romance fantasy paranormal superpowers drama tv show with a sparkle of martial arts and sword combat. Everything is so bad the only very good thing is Jenna Ortega acting and I am sure she will have a bright future. Wished she didn't had to do this as her first main cast role.Just watch it and forget it. People watched this garbage just because Tim Burton's name is on it.,4
North America,"I really love this show! It's hard to top Christina Ricci as Wednesday Addams but Jenna Ortega is amazing! She really nails Wednesday and she could carry this show all on her own. Fortunately, she doesn't have to because the rest of the cast is also great. Emma Myers is sure to be a breakout star from this show. Not since Willow in the original Buffy has there been such a wonderful ""sidekick."" Gwendoline Christie, Riki Lindhome, Joy Sunday, and Christina Ricci herself really make this show work as well.The writing and pacing of this show are perfect, too. Everything moves along at a brisk pace and you never want to stop watching. I really hope there is a season 2! Make it happen Netflix! You've struck gold with this show!",9
North America,"I'm not an especially fervent fan of the Addams Family so won't hold it against this spinoff that it doesn't follow its predecessor material 100% faithfully. However, it does seem to make some fundamental errors that go against the core of the Addams appeal. Firstly, a lot of the charm of the Addams' is them being unaware of how bizarre and frightening their macabre interests and lifestyle are to the people they encounter. To that end, Wednesday has too few such moments of juxtaposition and almost none of the Addams quirkiness is met with anything more than a quizzical look. That is partly down to the Addams feeling a bit watered down in this spinoff, but is mostly due to a bigger problem the series has: it's choice of world. Choosing to have the show take place in a school full of supernatural characters much of who are weirder & arguably more interesting than the Addams robs Wednesday of a lot of her uniquity. Where the Addams could previously shine against human foes, being a bit goth around actual vampires, werewolves and sirens seems a bit underwhelming.The series then also weirdly seems to forget that the show should be about Wednesday, and instead becomes a run-of-the-mill supernatural detective story that wouldn't seem out of place in half a dozen other series. You can replace Wednesday with any other character and the storyline wouldn't change much. Wednesday feels like a supporting character in someone else's mystery. Laurel Gates (not an established villain of the Addams) has come back to Jericho to exact revenge on the people she feels took everything from her family. She uses a Hyde to carry out her murderous plan which involves killing a coroner and mayor involved in a coverup, and destroying the school of outcasts that her family spent their lives fighting against. None of this really involves the Addams. There's a loose connection that's tried to be established - Laurel's brother was in love with Morticia and when tasked by his father to poison the school of outcasts, he instead goes after Gomez in a jealous rage and dies in the ensuing fight. It's quite a weak attempt to shoehorn the Addams into this mystery and the series itself seems to know this as Gates vs Addams isn't really the focus of the conflict, it's more Gates vs Nevermore. This becomes even more apparent when you consider that Laurel started her plan of revenge about a year before Wednesday was unexpectedly sent to Nevermore and so her plan wouldn't have involved the Addams at all.Lastly, the series throws in some tiresome modern social politics that all shows nowadays can't seem to help themselves doing. It's a bit too on the nose most times. When Xavier offers some advice to Wednesday about her visions, she says he's ""mansplaining"" them to her - visions she admits she only started having a couple months prior and doesn't know when they happen or how to control them, and Xavier's advice was coming from his dad who had been living with visions for decades. But sure, let's just tell him he's mansplaining. Enid's struggle with not having become a werewolf takes on a not-so-subtle parallel to gender identity when her mother suggests she goes for ""lycanthropy conversion therapy camps"". I don't know what it is about modern writers but they can't seem to get across admirable messages of acceptance, overcoming adversity, defying expectations etc without it coming across as preachy, jarring or having to put another group down in the process.The rest of the Addams, though they have little screen time, leave a bit to be desired. Pugsley is for some reason weak and defenseless when he should be just as intimidating and frightening to 'normies' as Wednesday is. Catherine Zeta Jones and Luis Guzman also just don't have the chemistry to match up to the iconic duo of Angelica Huston and Raul Julia.Jenna Ortega however does a sterling job as Wednesday; her delivery and timing is spot on but the script still somehow makes her feel tragically underutilized in a series that should be about her. Thing is excellently done and is probably the best portrayal of the character yet. The soundtrack is also commendable, in particular instrumental versions of Nothing Else Matters and Paint it, Black are superb. Gwendolyn Christie is also very enjoyable as an antagonist to Wednesday though succumbs to a cliched end.I overall still enjoyed the season, my few gripes don't detract too much from the positives and I'd be happy if a season 2 was announced.",7
North America,"Forced, hard to watch, and cringy. Could not even get through the first episode. I loved the movies as a child, but this series does not resemble the originals at all. I am not sure how people love it and give it such high ratings. Morticia and Gomez have no chemistry. Gomez was always very charming but in this, he is just creepy, and not in a good way. I agree with the others who said the values which bonded together the family in the original are missing here. It is under the ""comedy"" genre which puzzles me.When I saw the trailer, I was already skeptical and it saddens me that the outcome is even worse than expected.",1
North America,Jenna Ortegas extraordinary acting and the story are great in this show. The rest was kinda meh. Maybe would not watch it again but don't regret it. About the story: slowish on the first episodes but gets better towards the end. Loved the plot twist about the gates girl and her not being the obvious one. Some of the characters were definitely a bit childish and not the best. The Hyde was not at the expected level of sfx in my opinion. Directing was very recognizable Burtons work which I truly admire. Jenna Ortegas portrayal of Wednesday Addams was very good and somehow felt natural from the start. The back story was ok with the whole Gomez murder thing and whatnot.,6
North America,"These days it's pretty rare for a series this good to come around.Ortega plays Wednesday to perfection and it is surprisingly refreshing to see the character get more in depth, because let's be honest Wednesday was just a side character in the classic movies.This series succeeded every expectation of mine, which were very high. It's heartwarming to see that such a cult classic got such a good treatment.Tim Burton's style is present as expected and fits the series perfectly.I hope this Serie gets more seasons, but I'm almost certain it will when I look at the overwhelming feedback.Cheers to Netflix, I almost lost hope in you, but here you are giving me one of my favorite series in years!",10
North America,"Great adaption of the Adams family.Keeping Wednesday in character must've been a major challenge, which they mastered quite well.This time not a macabre comedy, but a black detective.They managed to keep the Adams vibe quite well. The story keeps you on your toes, while being amused by the macabre.Jenna plays her role as Wednesday very well. Thing plays a typical supportive role. Festers part is short bit fitting.Home's and Morticia's roles are a less convincing. They feel like ""forced into character"". Catherine seems visually fitting. But something is missing. For those who know the original comedies, Luis may not feel like a good choice for the role of Gomez.But their roles are limited and it doesn't really break the vibe.I enjoyed it very much and hope to see a fitting 2nd season.",9
North America,"I think the only way you could enjoy this series is if you had never seen the Addams Family movie or older series. Because if you had you could not help but be massively disappointed in this new show. It has lost all of the charm, warmth and wit of the previous show and movie and completely dismantled the original family dynamic. In this new series, they have completely trashed what made the original so wonderful - their love and support of each other and how they embraced and cherished their ""weirdness"".This show does none of that. Now I read through many 8, 9, and 10 star reviews and if they are legitimate reviews then I am happy so many enjoy this show. But I find those that rated it around 4, 5, and 6 stars seem more in touch with the reality that this show misses the mark in many areas.So if you like it, that is great! I might too if I wasn't so aware of how much they changed thing around in this version, and not for the better in my opinion.",8
North America,"I can't give this show less than 8 stars because honestly, it deserves 10 stars. The plot is very interesting and keeps the viewer invested. I enjoyed the mystery and Wednesday's pursuit of the truth around the school, and even the more ""slice of life"" moments like her having to find a club or the competition. Wednesday's actress portrays her exactly as I would hope,But the romance plot line broke my immersion and honestly just left me feeling irritated. The love interests are incredibly boring outside of the mystery around them. Except for his importance to the mystery, Xavier felt like your typical bland and overdone misunderstood artist. Tyler was the usually pretty boy with a dead mom and unsupportive dad that you see in a lot of stories. Every romantically charged scene made me groan and overall ruined my enjoyment of the series. Yes, it all lead up to a very interesting plot twist, but that doesn't change how badly it effected my viewing experience.I feel like there could be a better way to work the story to avoid a forced story, or even to rework the characters to where they'd be more viable love interests for Wednesday. But aside from my gripes with that aspect of the show, it was a fantastic watch and a very gripping story.",8
North America,Tim never fails to impress and I just couldn't get enough of Wednesday! I'll be waiting and praying for a second season for sure. Thank you Tim for the best show of 2022 you really checked all the boxes with this one. No spoilers here but if you're into dark comedy's this is the show for you. Left me on the edge of my seat and wanting more from the first episode to the last. I never write reviews but this one was worth taking the time to give a 10/10. I haven't been impressed by much the last two years show wise but this was as I said superb! Gratitude is all I have. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!,10
North America,"When I saw Wednesday pop up on Netflix, I kinda though it is gonna be another Witcher - Buy IP, bend it over, milk it and ruin it. But no. It was really enjoyable ride with great new characters and a pretty good take on the Addams family. The only thing I would say was subpar was Pugsley. He was much more timid and un-Addamsy than in other media, but it was handled pretty well. And for our protagonist? I adored her, she was capable, but not a Marry Sue. She was snarky and funny when needed and serious when it made sence. The plot is giant mystery that is kind of easy to guess, but the twist was well made regardless, because it made sence. It was not just a ""Dysney twist villain"" situacion.All and all, the actors were great, the plot was fun and intense, the score was amazing and it was really enjoyable!",9
North America,"""When I look at you, the following three emojis come to mind:
Rope. Shovel. Hole.""Mayhem * Murder * Teenage Animal Angst : The macabre Addams Family franchise gets a fabulous new series, worthy of binge-watching any day.The diverse cast, headed by Jenna Ortega, keeps the action seamlessly flowing along, serving up snappy dialogue and enough plot twists to seduce viewers into a ""just one more episode"" happy trance.The creative team gives a smart homage to Edgar Allan Poe's Murders in the Rue Morgue, by featuring Wednesday as the relentless Generation Z Detective Dupin. And hopefully Tim Burton's credentials are sufficient enough to warrant a few more seasons.",10
North America,"I find Jenna Ortega (Wednesday) portrayal of the character spot on. Uncle Fester was also well played by fred armisen. To be honest all characters are well played. But i must admit, there is a real liking for the character of Enid (Emma Myers) enid and wednesday work really well together and loved the ending of season 1? The way that enid kept trying to get wednesday. To show emotion was really well done, Everyone loves a hug. I didn't expect this show to be so good. , story was good monster was well done, camera. Work and visuals are spot on, this was a pleasure to watch.,and looking forward to the next season.",9
North America,"So I have grown up with the Addams family watching both the cartoons and the movies.Loved both. This is a diffrent version not like the others. For first we follow only Wednesday not the other family members. I didn't like the other members they're were not like I growned up with. It felt liked the actors was doing a bad cosplay version of them.My favorite Addams character have always been Wednesday but this Wednesday was not the one I used to love. She did have some matching qualities but this Wednesday was a angsty teen most of the time.I didn't like they're trying to do a drama show of it. And the classic triangle romance drama is boring.Wednesday have said herself she doesn't want to be a housewife. I think she better of alone then in a relationship.I would have liked the series better if it wasn't the Addams in it. It's like they took the Addams family and throw in harry potter, twilight and sabrina.I loved Christina ricci and Gwendoline. The Thing was the most fun and thats saying a lot.",7
North America,"Jenna Ortega just isn't Wednesday. From the old series to the movies, Addams family always had convincing actors. Christina Ricci was just excellent as Wednesday. Jenna Ortega just isn't, she is too smooth, too normal. Also all other known characters simply do not convinceAlso Addams is about over-the-top humor, and although it starts well with the piranha's, after that it is just never any fun and lots over personal issues and basic suspense.Can't imagine this is done by Tim Burton, it lacks his style and quality. The storyline of often illogical and the dialogues unnatural. So I guess he's lending his name while having a trainee do the work, or something like that.",4
North America,"While this is a series that feels aimed at teenagers.. the high quality production, sets and clothing, excellent camerawork, great pacing and a good execution of a simple murder mystery plot driven by an interesting character in an equally intriguing setting make for a generally entertaining series that anyone (that has 8 or so hours) can enjoy. It does remind of that latest ""Chilling Adventures of Sabrina"" series, down to the tone and romance woes.. as well as early Harry Potter movies' villain uncertainty and a tad of Riverdale (what I know about it from osmosis).The story as a whole is a bit tried and done.. and sadly, falls quickly into expectations.But the ""Addams Family"" connection gives it some leeway to unwrap itself differently and generate an identity worth pursuing.. even if the character Wednesday acts like she should in some situations and contradicts her herself in others.. like wanting to stop bad things from happening, you know, the core of the series. Personally, I don't crave their weird-charm (though, I do enjoy a good game of Gloom).. but it if is well executed, I can appreciate anything in any coat of paint. Not to mention the fact that Jenna does a fantastic job at continuing the mantle left by the talented Christina Ricci. Whom was a surprise to see again.. though, I had some expectations for her assigned character that were not off the mark. Beyond her, I enjoyed seeing Gwendoline Christie in another great role (an Actor that should get more roles), and I hope Emma Myers gets more attention after this.It's an easy watch, although I thought it could have been ANYTHING else besides the Addams, like a new adaptation of Mattel's Monster High.",6
North America,"I liked the cast. All of them. Characters and actors alike. Which is rare, especially among the recent products of Hollywood. I jumped into the show with little to no expectations, knowing it was just another ""Netflix remake"", and was greatly surprised. It didn't just use the name of a known franchise to capitalize on it. This was Addams Family. Well, mostly one of them, but still true to the original premise. The series reminded me a lot of Harry Potter: an earie school for ""unnormies"" with mysteries, secrets, rivalries, and monsters. With a healthy dose of Tim Burton flavour. Loved it. I'm down for another season. Hope it does well.",9
North America,"I wanted this to be a good new series for me. When i heard catharine zeta jones was going to be morticia, i was excited.She gets one of the stars, she was good. But only in 2 episodes. What. Gomez was good. 2 episodes. Uncle fester (not a fan of the actor, but the character) 1 episode.I get it, i get it, it is called Wednesday, it's not about the rest of them. That's the problem though. She needs the rest of them to work. Her relationship with her brother for example works.Here, she is just rude, unpleasant and doesnt work. She isn't likeable. So as your main character, that's not good. I get they thought her ""witty"" responses were funny, but they werent.It's why Wednesday only works as part of the family, not the main character. It's too much of the same.And dont get me started on werewolves, sirens etc.Just keep her with the family, keep her as the main character if you want, but have the rest as side characters helping her through her life etc.Oh and the other 2 stars are for the original and best Wednesday - Christina Ricci.",3
North America,"You just have to love it. Everything. From the cast, to the plot, the camerawork, absolutely everything! Wednesday is going to remain a great show for decades, that's for sure. Also, everybody loves Thing, it is a whole mood. So playful and funny! The morbid scenes are the right amount of frightening, you have laughter, crying, tension, love, hatred, teenage problems and more serious ones. It is quite inevitable not enjoying all kind of feelings mixed up armoniously. Everything is matching, making things that need to stand out to really catch your eye. It was expected to receive such a work of art coming from the well-known Tim Burton but this show exceeded expectations in the best ways possible!",10
North America,"I had no expectations on this show. Was I ever blown away! I've never been a big Addams Family fan but this show was fantastic!! I hope they do a second season!! I can hardly wait for it. Tim Burton I am a fan of as I like most of his work...Nightmare Before Christmas, Edward Scissor Hands, Corpse Bride....to name a few. All excellent films...so when I saw he produced this I had to check it out. I was not disappointed in the slightest. If you are a Tim Burton fan, Addams Family fan or both then this is a must watch!! You will not regret it. The second season if renewed can not come soon enough.",8
North America,"I found that this was definitely one of the better Netflix series I've seen. The camera work and colours chosen throughout was sublime ! The casting director done a damn good job as the actors played and executed their parts perfectly. The script was excellent honestly I was hooked throughout !. The only fault I really have about the series is I wish there was more episodes to watch ! I don't want to give to much away but I highly doubt you'll be disappointed if you decide to give this a go !It's also one of those shows you get so in to , it will probably only take you a day or 2 to finish. Hoping for a season 2 !Enjoy !",10
North America,"Exceeded my expectations! Kathrenine Zetta Jones is an almost Morticia we dreamt of, Luis Guzman is almost on par with Raul Julia (almost) but Jenna Ortega is simply stunning. This is the Wednesday I expected to experience as a teenager. To me these 8 episodes have been a smash, hope season two comes quickly!Also a few characters from the original theme come alive:LurchUncle FesterThe thing (amazing adaptation and effects)Story is as challenging as what one would expect from an Adams family adaptation.I really can't anticipate what to expect from the second season.Don't you dare not have one!!!!",9
North America,"Usually Netflix originals are compete drivel, and unfortunately Tim Burton hasn't been on his game for at least a decade but this was great fun.You're endeared to Wednesday perhaps even more so than in other adaptations, Jenna Ortega did a great job, as did the rest of the cast. Lots of misdirects to keep you guessing and no lazy writing to pander to the usual Netflix crowd.The character development for the main cast was great, everybody got their moment.Frightening & violent enough to make it feel naughty for kids to watch (very in keeping withe Addams feel) whilst keeping it interesting for adults too.There are enough nods to the source material and ealier adaptation that it'll keep older fans happy, but it is definitely it's own thing.Got a long wait for S2 now!",8
North America,"When I first heard of Wednesday I knew it was something that I had to check out. I am very glad I did. Wednesday is a show that will be sure to keep you entertained and wanting more. I found myself binging the show and was pulled into the story from episode one. If you're looking for a dark comedy show or just looking to try something new, I would highly recommend this show. Jenna Ortega does an amazing job on capturing the vibe of Wednesday and is definitely worth the watch alone. All the other cast members did an excellent job as well. I will be waiting and hoping for a season two announcement from Netflix to further entertain us with the fun and interesting adventures of Wednesday.",10
North America,"Tim Burton is a Masterful! & A Cinematic Genius! This series is and was creative, fresh, intense and artistically articulate. I could not stop watching after the first episode and I binged this series in two days! I can not wait for season two. The collaboration between Netflix and Burton is explosive. As one who grew up watching the television series The Adam's Family in the late 60's early 70's! This was a grand slam! The writing is amazing! The cast is superb, leaving little to no room for you not to simply be totally emerged with each and every character. Jenna Ortega hands down is brilliant as Wednesday Adams, quirky, quick witted and cute, rolled up into one. Congratulations Netflix!!!",10
North America,"I know I'm NOT the target audience, yet I went ahead and watched because Wednesday is one of the best true-to-themselves characters I've ever watched in shows and movies.The Good was exactly what I thought it'd be: Wednesday. The comebacks and brutal honesty are among the best parts of her character, and this series. Jenna Ortega is perfect regarding what the previous literature and screen adaptations of Wednesday have sought to be. She fails, time and again, but, while staying true to her selfish and lone-wolf roots, she continuously adapts to her situation, and even ""evolves"", not only her skills, but in the ability to trust others.She. Killed. It. I'll say it over and over again!The show's aesthetic and setting were great, too. The colors, contrasts, and costumes kept it light in saturation, but not too subtle to blend into the background.Now, the Bad. Unfortunately, it's another one of those Netflix/Hulu/CW/etc. Shows that has no redeemable white dudes (and almost no redeemable dudes in general). They're either villainous or incompetent, and tend to get in the way. It's a trend to try and force-feed or explain (no, not mansplain or womansplain, just explain) it to everyone who fits the above stereotype, but for those that don't fit into the agenda's crosshairs, there's a few reminders each episode that'll take you out of the immersive experience for a groan; And to those that do fit the agenda's sterotyping (leading to real-world racial-profiling), they most likely didn't watch the show, nor anything with the Addams family, probably. It'd be nice to have info regarding what groups this show is for/against. It'll never happen, but that would be nice for those that actually care.Also, Gomez ""look what they did to my boy"" Addams was a big whiff. Missing Raul Julia, and he is irreplaceable, but whether it was casting, writing, or chemistry, Luis Guzmán was cringe in the absence of charisma. In addition, Pugsley and Fester were letdowns. At least CZJ was a hit, but what wasn't was the writers' ideas to turn her into a remorseful and emotional wreck at times.Ortega carried (as expected), the setting was legit, the plot was predictable, and the supports were paper-thin as more copy-and-paste stereotypes to the subplot fodder.6/10.",6
North America,"Half of the show is about Wednesday Adams and the other half is a copy of Home Before Dark.It's strength is in it's visuals (theme, color scheme, effects, etc.) and characters which made it always enjoyable to watch but it's investigation story is a Home Before Dark knock off, I would have rated it 8/10 if it had a stronger more original story.Wednesday dorms with her opposite, Enid, they keep getting boyfriends but the best relationship potential is right in front of us the whole time, Wednesday and Enid, I was disappointed the creators didn't take it further, was the greatest missed opportunity in the series.",7
North America,"Not sure where to start, the characters are well written the story is well written, the visuals are very well executed, I went into this fully expecting it to be another 10 minute before turning off like many of the releases have been on all platforms of late, but no this had me hooked, it had my mind wandering towards how a scooby story should be written and executed ( unlike the future trash that is on its way) the throwbacks to the original Adams family and the films from the 90s were well placed and subtle, the casting was near on perfect, it's the first thing for a while I had no complaints. Disney Amazon netflix etc etc take note this is what you audience wants.",10
North America,"This show is definitely worth watching
I thought it was so well done I've always secretly been a fan of Tim Burton's work it's mind blowing
And kooky I'm hopeful for a second season and I had a.feeling that Tyler was gonna end up being the monster i would definitely go to nevermore. Xavier is probably more my Type not Tyler because he's the Hyde. For the second season I hope Wednesday still plans to get the monster. And go back to nevermore for another semester. Thing too he's definitely my favorite other then Wednesday the scene of Wednesday dancing at the dance was so great and the principal dying i didn't really like her.",10
North America,"Jenna Ortega is a mastermind. They could not have cast this show better. The plot, the aesthetic, everything was perfect. As a long time fan of the Addams family I was a little nervous for this one but I was hooked. This definitely did not disappoint! Another Tim Burton masterpiece to add to his collection. I wish the monster was a tad bit scarier but honestly it was fine the way it was. This is a creepy, fun show for the entire family. The only downside is I wanted more addams family time but all in all this show was fantastic! I binged watched it and I hope it renews so I can binge watch every season that follows!",9
North America,"I really enjoyed this series. Jenna Ortega was spot on as Wednesday, in my opinion. She was sharp and witty and delivered her lines without so much as a smirk and I loved it.What I didn't quite understand was the relationship between Wednesday and Morticia. I am not a die-hard fan of the original Addams Family show or movies, but I did see several of them and don't remember the tension and strife between the two of them, but maybe I'm just not recalling properly.Overall, I can't wait for season 2 to come out. I hope that this series ends up having a few seasons. I'm excited to see what is next at Nevermore!",9
North America,"I am 40 yrs old and have never watched any Addams Family movies, but I know the basic premise of the family's story. I don't have any kids of my own, but I am somewhat of a TV expert...some may consider me a bit of an addict. ??With that said, ""Wednesday"" was one of the best and most well done shows I've seen in ages. I was fully immersed in the world of Nevermore from the first scene. I loved everything about it...the style, writing (especially witty one-liners), characters, suspense, mystery...you name it, it had it all! I can normally guess how a show will end based on how it's edited...but not this time! It kept me guessing until pretty much the very end. I never thought I'd feel this way about this type of show, but trust me, you won't want to stop watching...and you will be super sad when it's over! I just finished it and felt compelled to immediately get on here and write this review, bc I want EVERYONE to experience what I just did while watching it. Pure amusement and joy!Now get off of your phone and go watch it...you won't be sorry!",10
North America,"I literally finish this in two days. The story was brilliant, and kept me guessing the whole time. I'm usually one of those people who can figure out mysteries pretty quickly. This one took me longer than most. Jenna Ortega IS Wednesday Addams. Christina Ricci has been succeeded by a beautifully dedicated and amazing actress. Jenna captured everything that we love about Wednesday. The creepiness, black heart, and dry humor are all there but it also comes with warm and caring for others.Some don't like Morticia and Wednesday not getting along. But I think it's just a teenager budding heads with her mother. Just because Wednesday and Morticia are goth doesn't mean teenage angst wouldn't follow them. I think with future seasons we'll see more kinship between the two. And we BETTER get more seasons, Netflix.",9
North America,"Wow, that was about 13% of what I was expecting. I certainly didn't expect the lovechild of Anya Taylor-Joy and Seven of Nine to be the next Wednesday.Eh, it was so-so. Of course, it was beautifully shot, scored and acted - all that was to be expected. I just didn't see why it needed to be 8 episodes. This could've easily just been a two-hour, stand-alone film.The title teen Addams is transferred to yet another school after, gasp, misbehaving and just think of it as a very, very scaled down Hogwarts. And just like Harry Potter, there are plenty of mysteries to solve before the end of the school year.While I didn't mind the casting at all, in fact, Catherine Zeta-Jones looked amazing and Jenna Ortega as Wednesday did good for the most part, I just thought they lacked chemistry as a family and I thoroughly didn't like this disjointed version of the Addams Family. Naturally anyone, including me right now, will compare this to the OG 90s duo (excluding the 3rd one.) I not only liked those first two films better than this whole season, but I even liked the 2019 animated movie more as well.Would I recommend? Eh, maybe. I didn't hate it and I did manage to stay through all 8 episodes with the first and last ones being the best ones. I won't watch any more. I prefer just to stick with the 90s classics.***Final Thoughts: Yeah, yeah, I'm beating myself up that it took me over an hour to figure out that side character is Christina Ricci.",5
North America,"This is basically the Addams family version of Nancy Drew. With that said, I was always a huge fan of Nancy Drew. I thought I would give it a chance and ended up binging it over three days. Good character development, twists and turns, and true to the Addams family feel and quirkiness. The actor who plays thing is excellent, incredible how he portrays a wide range of emotion. Several well-known actors also play characters, which was fun and a nice surprise. The mystery had you going in many different directions as to who was the perpetrator and it was wrapped up nicely with no loose ends. My only suggestion would be to have had more of the Addams family members incorporated in the plot. Hope they are working on season two.",8
North America,"There is clearly no understanding of the source material or what made the Addams Family such a beloved name. Everything at the core of the movies and shows is not in this series. There is no comedy or wittyness, it's all poorly written cringy, cliche, 'teen' dialogue. The weirdness of the family is completely muted because of the world being supernatural some reason. All the characters feel off. It doesn't feel cohesive.It's basically taking the worst of Riverdale, mixing some Harry Potter, and naming characters after the Addams Family characters. There is no reason for this to be tied to the brand. There was little to no effort done to make this a ""Addams Family"" show. On top of this, It's there has already been a show based on Wednesday before. By a YouTuber. Who not only did a better job made but understood the material a lot better. It's embarrassing that having so many people and such a massive budget produces such poor results.This would have been fine otherwise, but dragging a beloved IP into this lazy ""re-imagining'"", doesn't deserve anything past a single star. I'd give it half that if I could. I have nothing wrong with reboots as long as the spirit of the original is maintained. But this.... Do better.",1
North America,"As a kid I loved the original TV series of the Addams Family, and the 2 films were entertaining enough without ever living up to the TV Series. Wednesday Adams was always my favourite character, the sweet looking girl with a love of the macabre. Christina Ricci was standout in the films and for my money nailed the character. It was great to see her given a significant supporting role in this film but not at the expense of Wednesday being front and centre.When I saw this trailed I had high hopes and I have not been disappointed, if anything my expectations have been exceeded. In essence the original Addams Family series and the films are a succession of short sketches to play with the kooky and macabre for fun and laughs. Here we get a much deeper nuanced exploration of one of the characters outside of the family unit. This doesn't come at the expense of the fun, with lashings of Tim Burton's trademark dark humour thrown in for good measure.The series is expertly paced, without any weak episodes. The mystery and drama keeps you guessing while the dark humour is playfully woven around the main plot with plenty of nods to the originals and to horror film tropes in general.I have a minor gripe that stops me giving this 10 stars and that is Gomez and Morticia. While only playing minor roles in the story Gomez is portrayed as meek and subservient to Morticia and it grated with me a little as in every other version Gomes is a dynamic character in a relationship of equals with Morticia. This isn't a reflection on the performances of Luis Guzman and Catherine Zeta Jones who hold their own amongst a host of fine performances.Special mention goes to Gwendoline Christie who is imperious as Principal Weems, and especially Emma Myers as Enid, the day to Wednesday's night. The interplay and the developing relationship between Enid and Wednesday is one of the highlights of the series, as without Enid we wouldn't get to explore Wednesday's personality as deeply as we do. What we see here is a more grown up Wednesday than the ghoulish child we have seen before and so we don't have to worry about comparisons about who is your favourite Wednesday. They are different but the same if that makes sense.None of this would matter if Wednesday herself isn't front and centre. Jenna Ortega is simply magnificent as Wednesday. From the first moment she is on screen, you only see her from behind, and you immediately know she just is Wednesday. It is not just her expression but the whole way she holds herself, the way she walks, and then there is the eyes that tell you everything. The standout moment is the school dance.Everything you would want from Wednesday is delivered and then a few extra layers you don't know you wanted are added as a bonus.The series ends with a not so subtle hint that there could be more. I expect that viewing figures will determine that. I hope there is, but it would have to be Jenna Ortega, nobody else can play this version of Wednesday now. Christine Ricci owns the young version, Jenna Ortega own this older version.",9
North America,"I am not a great writer. This serial had me caught from the start. The actors, music, costumes perfect. Tim Burton at his best. An absolute Must see!!How to fill 600 characters? Usually I only write reviews when something is very bad, or very good. I really love this show and hope next season will be as good as the first. I love the macabre and I believe the main actrice will go far. This show gives me hope for Netflix in general. This show could become great, please don't mess up Season 2, where is Johnny Depp, this is a Tim Burton Movie after all. Johnny where are you ? You will come in Season 2 for sure.This show gets from me a solid 10.",10
North America,"Enjoyed the show very much. Wish there were more episodes, but also glad they didn't put too much filler in. Hopefully there will be a second season. Catherine Zeta Jones made a pretty good Morticia but Angelica Huston is still my favorite. Luis Guzman was not right fit Gomez though. He is more comedy that debonaire and to me doesn't compare to Raul Julia. Jenna Ortega was good at not emoting with her face and just using her eyes. I loved that Christina Ricci had a role too. I did not know that Wednesday was an aspiring crime novelist and the way it was worked into the plot was perfect but easy enough to figure out.",8
North America,"Wow! I was blown away! I fell in love with most pf the characters!! They had that Hogwarts, wanna eat em up appeal! Wednesday was phenomenal! Morticia! Love her! I always love Luis Guzman and of course he did a great job here. I guess we have to expect Tim Burton have his quirky weird ideas. I was a little put out in that being maybe the biggest watcher of Addams Family ever, my kids even looked like and pretended to be Wednesday and Pugsley at one point and my beloved dog was named Sonny Gomez, usually called Gomez or Gomey because he looked like Raul Julia! So handsome! FurLove of my life! Well, Luis Guzman grows on you anyway. And thankfully this is mostly about Wednesday who was amazing! She cracked me up so much! Typically atypical teenage girl!Gwendoline Christie was delicious!! I hope they find a way to resurrect her for more episodes! Now that we are spoiled! Great casting all around!I guess I will stop here because I don't want to spoil anything. I never expected to cry, in a good way, from a Tim Burton movie. This is richer and fuller. Well done! I am really curious about his process and how he went from making such kitchy and kind of silly movies to making something with so much heart. That could be a great story in itself!",10
North America,"I'm not sure what I expected but this is one of the best series Netflix has. It's a great mix of comedy, creepy, nostalgia and the graphics music etc are all entertaining. This is a home run for Netflix.Jenna Ortega nails this role. I'm not sure that's good for Catherine Zeta Jones though. Here's the deal about the 'Family' (and I get that the show needs Wednesday to be strongest but).... Anjelica Huston Was legit the BEST morticia since the original on tv. But Catherine doesn't have that morticia Adam's feel. Luiz Guzman doesn't feel like Gomez. I'm just not feeling him and the kid playing Pugsley def isn't a fit. The other actors and actresses in the series are GREAT. Like legit everyone. In addition to Jenna- The actress from Game of Thrones who plays the head of the school is SO good. Her name escapes me at the moment but she's great. The two boys that like Wednesday and her have a really interesting and strong chemistry too. The actress playing her school dorm mate is really good too. Christina Ricci is great too but oddly looks like an older wednesday lol. All the other cast of characters- on point.I really am surprised by the entire thing and really found myself enjoying it. Thanks to Netflix and they need to keep this one going a free seasons. It's like one of their best series.",10
North America,"I have watched three episodes and doubt that I will watch the remining ones.I realized the show was mainly about Wednesday, but not ALL about Wednesday. The one little, short scene with the rest of the family was fun and gave me the idea the whole family would be involved.The character of Wednesday is sullen to the point it is hard to like her or even be interested in her, and certainly not entertained.The story has gotten boring without much of a plot to it. I may try to watch some more of it later - but I sort of doubt it.It is hard to make a review that requires so many required characters.",3
North America,"8-episode series from Netflix and executive producer Tim Burton, who also directed the first four episodes (each about 45mns in length), which sees Charles Addams' morbid curiosity Wednesday Addams being shipped off to boarding school after being expelled from her latest public high school after putting piranhas in the swimming pool. In the first episode, Wednesday (Jenna Ortega) plots her escape from her Gothic confines, but all that is soon dropped (along with her therapy sessions) once Thing arrives to help our heroine adjust to her new surroundings, which includes a secret sect of teenagers--""Outcasts"" who have tapped and untapped supernatural powers--and unraveling the mystery of father Gomez's criminal past. There's also a monster tearing apart travelers in the nearby woods (one that leaves behind human footprints) and artwork from a mysterious book which appears to depict Wednesday herself in a fiery confrontation with a tall pilgrim. I hoped to detect some of Burton's sly humor in evidence here, but this series is needlessly overrun by boring teenage bullies (including in a flashback!) and a lachrymose sheriff (Jamie McShane) who keeps popping up like a bad penny but who never really accomplishes anything useful. Like most of the characters in ""Wednesday"", the sheriff is a plot function: he's there to move scenes along rather than to take a part in the action. Ortega is certainly well-cast (as is Christina Ricci, the '90s version of Wednesday, as a teacher at the school), but she has to carry this weighty thing a long way. The finale, a showdown between Wednesday and two villains plus another fight between CGI monsters (one of them Wednesday's ditzy roommate, who suddenly finds her true self as a werewolf) is pure hogwash, one in which Wednesday is unceremoniously dragged into the 21st century by getting her own iPhone!",5
North America,"I grew up with the awful Addams family cartoon airing on Cartoon Network and never really liked it that much, except for the character Wednesday. The same goes for the movie from 1991. So having some reference material I feel somewhat conflicted about this series and that's got mainly to do with the main character. I liked Wednesday at the beginning of this series but that feeling went went averse the closer I got to the end of the first season. She just doesn't seem genuine... for an Addams. I won't give away any spoilers but her acts throughout the episodes are conflicting the character she pretends to be. Now she just seems a teenager with Asperger syndrome rather than being a psychopath. I get it you know. They wanted to give the character Wednesday a bit more depth in her personality since a TV series runs longer than a movie but doing it the way they did it, didn't work for me.Speaking about characters. The other students at Nevermore Academy seem to be a bunch of dweebs and because of that I started to think who is this show for? I don't mind some teenage drama but this show is just filled with it in it's most simplistic form. Unfortunately it also includes the nowadays typical 'modern' inclusion propaganda that it could've gone without.It's not all bad though. The main storyline was entertaining although it got a bit boring while nearing the ending. Some details just didn't seem to match up making it sloppy. For me the thing that I perhaps liked the most was... well... Thing. It's by far the most humorous thing of the series. He might only be part man(?), or whatever he is, but somehow his appearances always seem to work out for the better.Also, according to the credits this is a Tim Burton's production but I didn't really notice much if anything of his influence. Perhaps he did the catering for the crew?",5
North America,"Typical modern Hollywood Mess. This show tries so hard to be cool it wreaks of desperation. The show moves along in a clunky manner and the acting is stiff as a corpse. Try as they may to improve on the original Addams Family, they flunk out on every subject. The casting is hit and miss with Wednesday and Morticia being hits and the rest misses.I just don't understand why this awful mess is getting any positive reviews, but it seems that these days people rate everything as a 10. Reviewers seem to forget that there really has not been that many true 10's in film, so why would this rate a 10?? Curious why it rates as perfect? It is quite laughable. Anyway, this show is just plain boring and awful.",2
North America,"There's barely anything connecting this to the Addams, just the name. Characters outside of Wednesday are boring. And on top of that it's just a bunch of teenage supernatural drama cliches and tropes we've seen already for over 10 years now.This feels like it was another show and Netflix decided to attach an IP to it to make it sell better. Pretty common nowadays but disappointed that this is from Burton. Most of his other fish out of water movies work so much better since there is more to the characters.I don't know, maybe I'm the wrong demographic for this or I'm looking at it the wrong way.",3
North America,"Wednesday is presented as someone out of her time. She doesn't use the internet (she prefers writing on a typewriter), she doesn't watch television, and she doesn't care about social norms/cues.So then why does she use a term like ""mansplaining""? How did she even hear that word if she keeps to herself and doesn't socialize? Why does she care about the whitewashing of history? Why does she constantly talk about colonization? Why does she talk like a twitter user 50% of the time? This wouldn't be a problem if a character like Enid talked like this, but it makes no sense coming from someone who is supposedly detached from everyone and everything. For someone who we are meant to believe stands out, she sure talks like every other teenager her age.",5
North America,"Overall I was satisfied with this series. It was not a home run, but it was definitely watchable. I thought Jenna Ortega played the part of Wednesday very well, and Catherine Zeta Jones made a good Morticia. The actor who played Uncle Fester reminded me of the original series depiction. I didn't have any major problems with any of the school mate characters or actors. The story and tone were on key, which I was happy with. It almost had a Harry Potter-esque vibe going on and a hint of Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow. The art direction was on point. The story stayed focused on Wednesday, which is a good thing. After all this wasn't an Addams Family show. The downside was the CG for the monster was a bit wonky and low quality. Also Gomez and Pugsley were a bit of a let down, but they aren't a major part of the show, so it did t subtract too much.",7
North America,"The Addams Family movies were truly my favorites as a child. I've seen them both more times than I can count. That being said, this show is not the iconic 90s film, or the old show, or the classic cartoon. So just don't expect that and go into it with an open mind. I absolutely loved this show. Binged it in two days. It gives Tim Burton does Harry Potter with a twist of Nancy Drew. Wednesday is completely endearing, perfectly macabre. Her one liners hit every time. I love the relationships she forms with her peers and I enjoyed the mystery of the storyline. The cast is spectacular in my opinion. Perfectly creepy, kooky, mysterious, and spooky.",9
North America,"I knew this would be fantastic before I even started watching it, as I am a huge fan of Tim Burton. And God, is he a master at what he does.This is utterly fantastic. It was dark, yet funny, yet heartwarming at times, which was honestly unexpected.Jenna Ortega's portrayal of Wednesday. Addams is phenomenal. I couldn't stop watching.Even better, I thought it was going to be incredibly predictable. And I won't talk about the ending, but I was incredibly surprised by the outcome.The only small criticism I have, I did not care of her uncle fester's part at all. And I would've liked to have seen a little more of Morticia. I loved Catherine Zeta Jones portrayal as Morticia.I really hope there's a second season. I can't wait for it. And I highly recommend the show!",10
North America,"I was not sure about this as we have seen so many Addams Family movies over the years, but this is quite good. Jenna Ortega is great as Wednesday and she plays the part so well. The story is good and keeps you watching to see ""who dunnit""?Gwendoline Christie as the head mistress is great casting and she is perfect in that role!BUT Luis Guzman as Gomez is soooo wrong. He comes across as very very creepy and not in a good way! Catherine Zita Jones as Morticia does not work either.The rest of the younger cast play their parts well.An enjoyable series that keeps you guessing and just when you think you know the answer....they get bumped off!",8
North America,"I wasn't sure if I would like this show and was not confident that the character Wednesday could be broad enough to have a stand-alone show, but I was pleasantly surprised.I binge-watched all the available episodes in no time, leaving me wanting another season.The only thing that disappointed me in the show was Gomez Addams, played by Luis Guzmán. While I like this actor, I don't feel he was a good fit for this character. Not sure how the casting director came to pick him; there had to be other actors who tried out. Fortunately, his character has a minimal role.Jenna Ortega completely steals the show with just enough darkness, dark humor, and goth romance to keep the show captivating.",10
North America,"But it's a solid 7 the actress who plays Wednesday (Jenna Ortega) is very good as is Christina Ricci and Gwendoline Christie where it falls flat is the casting of Catherine zeta Jones as Morticia who isn't terrible but not that good either and Luiz Guzman as Gomez, whoever thought that these two would be a good fit should be shot because between them they have zero chemistry and it's painful to watch, when I used to watch the old black and white Adams family and the later remakes with Angelica Houston and Raul Julia there was real sexual chemistry between the them and that's was what made it's so good but this lack that chemistry and even though they're only in a couple of episodes they felt awkward to watch but having said all that it's still a solid show and worth watching if you liked Sabrina on Netflix you'll like this it's very similar in that it takes away some of the humour and replaces it with horror.",7
North America,"The series was announced a few years ago. And all these years I, an ardent fan of Burton and Addams, have been waiting for a miracle. It will be just an orgasmic combo, such wonderful and perfectly combined 'ingredients' in one dish!However, from the very first minutes of the series, it became clear to me that everything was gone. Boredom... ringing boredom... No atmosphere, no worthwhile dialogues, no charismatic actors. Who riveted it? Did he even watch the original? The first episode, Mortisha's farewell to her daughter: Mortisha burst into tears from the fact that Wednesday talks to her unkindly. Seriously? Why turn a unique character of an infernal mother into an average American mom from movies?And Wednesday? Performed by Christina Ricci, she has become a legend! We still remember this amazing character. A psychopathic girl with a rod that you're really afraid of. What's going on here? Just a nerdy little girl in black clothes with a scowl.Judging by the general facelessness of the plot (and everything in general) and the similarity with hundreds of current youth series, it seems that Burton was rigidly placed within the framework of the modern agenda and he simply does not know how to fit into all this, so in trying to pass for his own, he makes a terribly clumsy 'G'.God, Timmy, how is this possible with your experience and spontaneity? You're a genius.That's it, I don't have the strength to paint this horror anymore, everything is bad there.",1
North America,Ortega did a FANTASTIC job as Wednesday. She is lovely and dark! Who I can't stand watching are Guzman and Jones as Gomez and Morticia Addams. These characters are so iconic. These two actors failed where others have been successful. Their acting failed these two characters. Gomez always had a positive upbeat attitude who was always passionate and over the top. Guzman falls flat in his interpretation as Gomez. Jones is beautiful and classy but she lacks the spice required to be Morticia Addams. I'm so glad most of the series lacks both of them and concentrates mainly on Wednesday and her mystery solving.,8
North America,"This show has got to be one of my all time favorites!On the first day of watching this i just got hooked and couldn't stop! In fact i binged the whole series in one day. The show isn't some spin off of the other Addams family movie, instead, it is a show about a new era of Wednesday. Wednesday is instead a high school student instead of a child. Wednesday is sent to a special boarding school where her parents met. Wednesday discovers that there are secrets within the school walls as well as the town it self so she decides to figure these secrets out for herself. There isn't much more i can say without giving it away but this is one of my favorite tv shows now that i have watched it and i recommend you watch it well!",10
North America,"I cannot believe how good this is for a teenage tv show! Loved it!After waiting a while to see something different on Netflix, this comes along.Although I didn't think to much of it in the first 2 seconds, it started to surprise me.I loved the Angelica Huston/Raul Giulia Adams couple a lot, but the new ones exceeded my expectations. Actors great, plot great! Settings awesome, the movie was actually filmed in Romania and looks amazing.It has the goth, it has the drama, it has the mystery and of course it has the magic. Give it a chance when you can it is completely worth it.Go go Burton!",9
North America,"You take the original funny, campy, dark comedy, intrigue on the original series, and meet that up with a darker modern version of said series. That's what you get with this. Gomez (whatever), Morticia (nicely done), Pugsley (whatever), Thing (perfect), Uncle Fester... I had my reservations because of the actoi, but he actually nailed it for this Addams Family type thing. And, Wednesday was supremely perfectly cast. Wednesday's not quite werewolf roomie was great. The entire cast was well done, and the story they portrayed was superb. If you like weird, funny, scary, odd stuff... watch it. It's worth it.",9
North America,"I didn't have high hopes - stand-alone movies were nice as they've been set on unknown territory and in result we could be getting pretty much anything and I loved that. It was a kingdom of catchie phrases (""Debbie, pastels?!""), funny cross overs and a bit of kids gore. Drop all your hope if your looking for this in burtons series.As Morticia I could forgive a lot but lack of quick and smart humor is just way too big pill to swollow. Sabrina, oh sorry Wednesday suddenly have feelings and learnes to have friends. Sorry - not my Addams story. Disappointing and quite flat and boring. The Netflix family filter is definitely not helping here. Such a waste of potential or maybe it's one of those should never been touched?",4
North America,"I thought this was gonna be a kids series like others on Netflix, with not much story line and mainly focus on school dramas etc... But I was hooked on the first episode. I'm a big Harry Potter fan, and ever since the series is finished, I am on the hunt for something similar. This show is it!It is a well rounded show. Story is written well. All mysteries are explained in the end. Characters are well written, except Tyler and Xavior. The show could have given them a more complex story, but no, all I know about them is that they have a fascination for Wednesday. The whole show they only follow Wednesday and try to get her to date them. Wednesday just keeps making mistake that gets her and her friends killed/injured, and she doesn't learn from it. But of course she is bullet proof as a MC, so the show runners think it's ok for her to do all these things without thinking. It just shows that she is not a very smart person.Some parts of the story are long. The final boss fight was disappointing and lack of climax.However, it is a great show overall. Lots of mysterious and magic elements. If the show runner writes well for the next seasons, this show could really be the next Harry Potter.",8
North America,"I really enjoyed this and it's so much more reflective of the original cartoon/comic by Charles Addams.Gomez was originally depicted as having a somewhat grotesque appearance, with a tubby body, a snub-nose, a crooked tooth and a receding chin. Luiz Guzman portrays this so well.Catherine Zeta Jones is so beautiful and elegant, I think she plays Morticia well, although Angelica Houston is a hard one to beat!Jenna Ortega is brilliant as Wednesday and was pleased to see Christina Ricci in the show too as one of the teachers.Loved all the other characters in the school.Really hope this is renewed for further seasons.",8
North America,"The best TV show in a very long time. The acting Was outstanding. Not only for the main actress playing Wednesday, but by everyone. The support cast were so strong. Catherine Zeta Jones was well cast and was great. I loved Thing, Heidi, the sirene. Shouted for joy when Heidi Wolfed out. Good story and well paced.8 episodes Was perfect. The cinematography was excellent.All the young cast have a big future in Hollywood.Give this a go. Hubby was also hooked. He originally thought it was just a high school bit of nonsense and was pleasantly surprised.It keeps you guessing pretty close to the end, and the dark humour just made it fun to watch.",10
North America,"Who would think that Addams family mixed with Tim Burton would end in a teenager serie trying to mimic Harry Potter. I expected more from Tim Burton and don't find the spirit of the movie but just another Netflix marketed serie for kids.The main character is now 20 instead of 11 in the movie still wearing braids and the story begins in a college nowadays...
The plot also is not really follow able. I can't follow an episode completely without feeling bored.But maybe I am not the target for this kind of serie. Only watch if you like teenagers movies.Only Christina Ricci and Catherine Zeta Jones are gorgeous in their roles but you don't see them often.",2
North America,"It's not an exaggeration to say this is literally ""Riverdale"" and ""Chilling Adventures of Sabrina"" story lines that got rearranged & copy and pasted for this show's plot, I know that because I did myself the misfortune of sitting through all these shows. It's a disappointment, with misleading trailers and reviews. It's so grossly over-hyped just for you to realize it's nothing but a lazy cash-grab, and that's why every promotion focused so much attention to the big names rather than the story or content itself. Something that you can unmask about the positive reviews is that none of them are critical or capable of a detailed opinionated review. Their reviews are vague and reason-less because they liked the decent looking actors, the superficial aesthetic, the good but basic indie/overplayed soundtrack, and the slightly Tim Burton atmosphere, but they're unable to pinpoint that because most of these reviewers are likely unaware of it. When it comes to the actual story, no way did anyone like this shallow plot that is no joke, a rip-off of ""Riverdale"" and ""Chilling Adventures of Sabrina"". The protagonist is a cookie cutter ""weird girl"" who always has to remind you every time she opens her mouth that she's ""not like other girls"" which gets old quick but lasts the whole series. No character, not even the protagonist, has growth, depth, character, or culture (which is ironic because of how much Jenna talks in interviews about representing her Latin culture). The dialogue the writers wrote for the protagonist is very clearly what a mindless person would imagine a thinking person sounds like but to anyone sensible she just sounds very pretentious and childishly edgy. While previous depictions of Wednesday made her a smart and funny character (and movies like Addams Family Values gave her growth), this Wednesday is hard to not cringe at. You can tell this was just a paycheck to the creators because they literally thought throughout this series that a one-off act done in the movies was some kind of deeper connection to her history. They took an interesting eccentric family and instead chose to center the story on boring cardboard cutouts of fantasy teen drama extras who are an unsubtle attempt to one-up the eccentrics of the family which obviously misses the entire point of the Addams Family. On the second watch, It really stuck out, how bad the acting is, most of the actors are either under-performing their parts or dramatically performing like Disney channel cartoon characters. In its most basic proposition this show had potential if there were any creative minds involved. The biggest disappointment is the reception, lousy cliche cash grabs like this getting positive support to this extent, just confirms people will eat up anything. If they like the aesthetic, the big names, and the heavily reused soundtrack, regardless of any effort or creativity on their end people will pay a lot more for copy and pasted formulaic media. We're in a never-ending cycle of unoriginal and uninspired remakes, reboots, redesigns, spin-offs, sequels, etc. Because big companies like getting rid of any shred of originality and people support milking out any creativity to the point media becomes this dry. It's frustrating because even the people involved in making this series have publicly admitted to rushing it and inserting the most basic and predictable cliches because of how little this side-project mattered to them.",1
North America,"Glad to see I'm not the only one that's seeing this.Normies? Muggles? Um, what?The headscarf with snake underneath?That rowing competition?The statue that leads into a tomb?The shapeshifters, the werewolves... I mean, if there is a season 2, will they reveal Cousin Itt to be an Afghan Hound?Also,
+ Twilight
+Chilling Adventures of Sabrina
+ that classic Simpsons episode where Lisa uncovers the truth about Jebediah SpringfieldCatherine Zeta Jones was a mid casting choice as Morticia. Also, it bothered me how they made Morticia some kind of preppy soccer helicopter mom that's trying to manipulate Wednesday.Jenna Ortega tried her best in the title role. But I found myself cringing a bit too much - but that was mostly the writing so can't really blame her for that, except that dance at the prom - 60's Wednesday knows how to break it down (iykyk).Tbh, I'm shocked that this show is being accepted so well.Shows/stories like this remind me of going to church where pastors preach the same stories/rules to a congregation that just laps it up.I found myself saying ""Wednesday wouldn't react like this"" so many times.",5
North America,"Absolutely horrible. Usually when something is this bad production is stopped mis project. Giving Wednesday super powers? How rediculous is that?! I see why there are many bad reviews and why Netflix is doing damage control and have them removed. Tim Burton's directing couldn't even save this monstrosity. None the the characters look like, act, match anything like they should. It is more as though this is a parody meant to mock The Adam's Family. I tried to find anything about it as to go so far to analize the camera work, lighting, dialog, anything. It was just very poorly done from the beginning. The cast is is full of greats but cannot perform the characters well, the writing is the worst, it is as though a bunch of Jr. Highers got a quarter million dollars for their project and had no guidance.",10
North America,"I've been so excited to see this series & it didn't disapoint me at all!Jenna Ortega was born to play Wednesday Addams & I really enjoyed watching her play this iconic character, that is loved by so many.This series is so funny, entertaining, well casted & totally awesome from the very beginning until the end. It's a nice addition to the Addam Family's legacy ??It was truly a delight to watch the amazing Gwendoline Christie play Larissa Weems. Her scenes with Wednesday were my absolute favorite. I love them & they both got my whole heart after their magical performances.When I heard that Christina Ricci had been added to the cast, I was so happy & her performance as Marilyn Thornhill were pure brilliance.Other favorites of mine from this series are Enid, Thing, Eugene, Bianca, Xavier, Tyler, Yoko & Ajax. I really hope we'll get a season 2, so we can see more of these wonderful characters.This might not be to everyone's liking but I really enjoyed watching it & totally recommend you to give it a try!",10
North America,"I have been watching this with my twelve year old daughter and it is absolutely awesome ??.Like most we were unsure if anyone else could match up to Christina Ricci but Jenna does an absolutely brilliant job of it and easily matches up to Ricci bringing her own slant to the role.The show has everything;
Awesome cast and acting
Stunning visuals
Humour
Horror
Special effectsBrilliant,easy to follow storylineWe are on episode four. Looking forward to the other four episodes!!It's worth it just for Wednesdays outfit and then dance at the ball.....
I guarantee you will smile from ear to ear ??Enjoy!!",10
North America,"What a great show, dark, funny and great story line. Lots of subtle nods and references to old school Adams family stories including actors/actresses from that era.Great casting of Wednesday she played the emotionless yet dark character perfectly!Hats off to the costume team as well for all characters new and familiar.It would be nice to learn more about the school and the different types of teachers but try not to go too hogwarts though with Tim Burton at the helm I'm sure it won'tWell done netflix another binge worthy series I'd happily watch again....so when is season 2 coming? I'd love to see more of how the school was created and who by.",10
North America,"I´m still amazed at Tim Burton´s last work (of art). Where to begin? The gorgeous gothic aesthetic? The excellent soundtrack? The magnificent performances? For me it´s reading in between (and not so in between) the lines. Who are the outcasts? The lgbtq plus community, the migrants, the weirdos, the freaks, every one that´s not a ""normie""? A normie according to whose standards? Wednesday is a cry against discrimination and exclusion and I´m effing loving it fuerte! Recomiendo este show to everybody, teens, grown ups and children as well aunque hay algunas escenas que son scary no es nada que les niñes no hayan visto antes. Desperately wanting more!",10
North America,"I have been looking forward to this series for months! I'd been counting down the days and really hoping that the series would live up to my expectations and not ruin Wednesday as a character. It surpassed my expectations and they didn't ruin her at all!This dark, spooky action packed mystery and still comedic at times, was absolutely perfect.I've always loved Jenna as an actress from my childhood programs and she was the perfect Wednesday- she looked the part and I loved the hair and outfits and the so very Wednesday facial expressions, and she acted to perfection. All of the characters were well developed and the plot had lots of unexpected twists and turns in it. I binged the show in a week.Although it's a twelve, it contained quite a bit of gore (I was absolutely fine with it ) but I advise you just to check that you'll be ok with it before watching, but other than that it's so good! Would 100% recommend and hoping for season two ??????",10
North America,"I watched the Adam's family as kid but never really thought much of it and wasn't a favorite of mine or anything.My girlfriend recommended the show saying people thought it was good and I'm open to try new shows so I agreed we should check it out.The acting is really good, the script is great, it's funny, dark, her character is not representative of anyone I know and it was really interesting to see the world through a different lens. My girlfriend said Tim Burton told Wednesday not to blink in the show, that was something I noticed. Really crazy.I'm a big fan of the fantasy genre and there was an element of this to the show which was great. To me it was a mix of a fantasy show, mystery and comedy. Highly recommend the show and we are really hoping for many more seasons if the quality stays this good!",10
North America,"This was a surprise I was not expecting. This show is here to entertain us and oh boy it did.Jenna Ortega did amazing job and so did all other actors. With these kind of roles it can get a bit sketchy over time, but not here. The story is interesting and the dialogues were written really good. There are some lazy writing fillers, but honestly they fit perfectly for the purpose to focus on bigger picture and not hang on endless details.Also fans of other movies that are made around magic and beasts will enjoy the Easter eggs this series have. Its almost like quiz to make you more invested into the show.I'm so glad I watched this!",9
North America,Holy crap this is the best show of 2022 it's worth the 2 year wait and I hope this isn't a mini series I hope this has 5 or 3 seasons it's absolutely brilliant way better than 1899 and walking dead it's very dark brutal and incredibly funny Jenna Ortega is amazing as Wednesday the first 7 episodes are brilliant the plot twist was unexpected the cliffhanger is so annoying cause u have to wait 3 years for season 2 the final episode I would give a 8.2 cause it's kinda confusing and strange like was Xavier the real Hyde that's what so weird u never find out who took the pictures of Wednesday I hope everyone enjoys this TV show I absolutely love it.,10
North America,"I adore the movies from the 90s, so I was absolutely wishing and hoping this show will bring back the charm, comedy and eccentricities of the Addams', considering Burton is directing this one. Boy was I wrong. This hits all the wrong spots to the point where it's just not the Addams family.The whole premise revolved around the clash of this unique family with normal vanilla society. So we get mermaids and werewolves? What? This literally makes Wednesday lose what was special about her, because she's actually the most ordinary one in the bunch. She's just a goth girl with mediocre teenage angst and the rest is every high-school show you've ever seen.Remember her going to camp? That was classic. This is what I was expecting. What I got was just a teenager going to school Scooby-Doo mystery with none of the ingredients that made this family magical.I'm not even going to get into the casting of the parents, each a disgrace to their former counterpart's brilliant and charismatic performance. They could have just put a black dress on a tree and call it a day. Below zero chemistry.Then you have this horrible relationship between Wednesday and literally everyone. They used to have such amazing family dynamics. It was the perfect contrast to their absolute horridness that we all loved.Where's the dark comedy? Where's the craziness of this twisted family while presenting it completely normal? I gave it 3 stars purely because of production value, but content is zero for me. Bored out of my mind.#justiceforwednesday.",3
North America,I started watching this and can't stop watching it now. Was not expecting this. I was surprised to see Catherine Zeta Jones playing Morticia. All the Adams Family are back. Really enjoy watching Thing. Also surprised this was a Tim Burton's work. So neat to see Christina Ricci in it as she is a past Wednesday. It kind of reminded me of a dark Harry Potter. Hoping there will be a second season on Wednesday.Gwendoline Christie it is nice to see this actress out of her Game of Thrones character.The only disappointment is Gomez. He does not have the charm or good looks as the movie Gomez. Could have been better cast.,10
North America,Like most others i'm sure they weren't expecting too much from a netflix adaptation. But i was pleasantly surprised it was in in my opinion an easy watch. In my case it kept me coming back for more. I think Jenna did an amazing job of portraying Wednesday. My only qualm is they could've made her more like the original. In the way she was always trying to kill her brother she had no problem doing something bad. She wasn't just dark she was also a little evil. They could've done that with the whole family to be honest. They all seemed a little soft. But i still give a 10/10 because i still thoroughly enjoyed there adaptation. And i'm hoping for a second season where they can redeem themselves in that area.,10
North America,"This is the most delightfully rendered fun thing I've seen on TV in years. No heavy philosophy or critical issues just sheer enjoyment and charm.Jenna Ortega is key and I can't imagine her losing to anyone when the award shows come around.The director's awards are far more tricky, but if it were up to me, I'd crown Tim Burton best of the lot. We're about 4 episodes in and in each one there have been signs of true genius in his choices and they're almost incomparably exquisite. As an example, his take on Thing goes way beyond the call of duty.When I think of the cartoon series and how Burton saw something he could work with and how easily I brushed it off as not my thing back in the day, I feel bad for myself.What a gift!",9
North America,"I don't know where to start, I can only say that this series was able to show the paradox of the character in the best way and establish an admirable relationship between the audience and himself despite the mysterious character of Wednesday.Considering the cold atmosphere of the story, we can safely say that this series has been able to maintain its comedy mood well.In fact, it should be pointed out that there is room to work on special effects, and on the other hand, it should not be forgotten that characterization and storytelling really do not matter.Finally, I suggest you not to miss this series because I guarantee you will definitely not regret watching it.",10
North America,"This is not the reimagining of the Wednesday Addams. Now she is like a broken heart girl who wears punk fashion without any Addams DNA. The Addams are close to each other in the family because they have their lifestyles, which are different from the others but don't make them lonely. They have friends and fun activities and are not afraid of sad emotions. Tim destroyed the Addams by giving them the loser character to all the family and making them normal.So please find the 1993 version or some cartoon and feel free to watch it then; you will see what I mean and you will understand how funny this family.",1
North America,"After acting like a grown adult, and giving the show a run through, i'm hooked. Jenna Ortega quickly takes on the role of this reimagining.Her delivery of the beloved character is definitely her own, but just as entertaining. She's quirky, strange, and dark humored just as anyone would expect. There are some cheese moments but then again so did the original Addams family material.In a way, it's refreshing that the show runners didn't take this the full brooding, dark, and insincere serious tone that a lot our other childhood favorite comics or original films have opted for as of recent.Definitely give yourself an episode or two acclimate. It'll feel just right in not time at all.",10
North America,"When i heard that there was a series dedicated solely to my faviourte character from the addams family coming out, i was exited. I thought that maybe the series will be dark and a bit spooky but not much story line. Well i was wrong Tim Burton suprised me with an absolute mastetpiece. Its suspensfull spooky and funny much more than i ever imagined. The whole cast is simply amazing and everyone fits perfectly in their role, even though i was used to the old addams family and at first thought that morticia and gomez where not casted propably, but again i was wrong, latet in the series you can only be amazed by both their acting. The background and music always fit perfectly, small little details(roses in both hospital room and bedroom from the therapist) were stuning. Until the last eposode you never truly knew who the mastermind was. Waiting patiently for season 2.",10
North America,"Tim Burton's new TV series was great. The two year wait, was worth it. I hope they will renew it for a second season. Jenna Ortega was brilliant as the titular character, she really brought Wednesday life. The design of Thing was completely the best thing I ever saw. The other actors were strong and well played, the only thing I would change. Would be Catherine Zeta Jones as Mortisha, I felt her acting was flat and never screamed Mortisha. I would still recommend this too my family and friends too watch.Enid finally Wolfing Out in the episode 8 was great.Thing almost dieing in episode 7 was heartbreaking.",10
North America,"Burton and Elfman have collaborated on so many over the top masterpieces that a person might believe the subject matter and actors don't even matter. They could take the lamest wokest most cliche'd set of tropes, or, for instance, one of the insufferably adolescent Stephen King stories, and turn it into something magic and memorable. That being said, the lead actress is stellar, capturing a morbid cloud and still emitting rays of humor and beauty. It is also a surprise and delight that the giant warrior lady from game of thrones is quite a salty actress in more tame surroundings. The only other point IS the selection of material. The Addams family, which kind of invented dark slapstick, is really a daunting subject for a remake/sequel. Never fear. Or, should I say, always fear.",9
North America,"I love anymovie that tim burton makes that so i love this one when i found out that tim burton is the director of the series, i guessed that it must be a good series and he has created another wonderful world. I'm waiting for next season , soooooon please. My favorite character in this series is thing. It's so funny and cute. Also character of enid. I think their relationship was so beatiful. She made wednesday able to express her feelings. The last scene of the movie, when wednesday hugs enid, was very emotional. And i wished i had a friend like that. In general, this series is great for those who love the fantasy genre.",10
North America,"All the right pieces were there to make something great, something unique, instead they chose an easy way out, creating a dull, uninspired mystery show combined with cheesy teenage drama you'd normally find on CW. Jenna Ortega, Gwendoline Christie and Luis Guzman (and all other comics-inspired characters) put on a captivating performance. There's still a bit of heart present in the show, but in the end it chooses to omit its most interesting ideas and it pains me to say that in the end, it was not worth it. Should've been a mystery-of-the-week kind of thing or just a 6-episodes mini-series with more of the Addams family's fun adventures!",6
North America,"This series has it all... comedy, drama, romance, mystery and action all wrapped in a delightfully quirky package. It's rare that I binge watch anything but I was riveted by this show. It's clever. The writing is smart, the costumes and scenics are dazzling and the cinematography took great advantage of the location work in Romania. This level of acting, production design and visual effects are rare in a television series and more what one expects on the big screen. I would've liked a slightly longer season than 8 episodes, I feel 10 would have been better. Still, this show is a winner. Watch it.",10
North America,"That any other thing said would be pure pompous redundancy.From now on in this review I will just write any random jibberish, since the minimum required number is characters for the review is 600.Less is more. If you need to prolong your opinion for so long, it sounds like you are not certain about your logic.Precision is the key. Concise arguments are sharp, short. Hit you instantly.But rules only exist to be broken. If this imdb policy shall not be quickly reviewed, the tool will became increasingly irrelevant. Amazon's fingers are too deep rooted steering its directions away from neutrality.",10
North America,"Tim Burton is back with a very fun, dark and dynamic show - a reminder of his talent.Finally, he chose a representative and diverse cast, with outstanding performances by all the actors involved. They all do a fantastic job with their roles, with Jenna Ortega stealing the show. It's like the role was written for her, she is humorous, dark and beautiful (the 'dance scene' in episode 4 is just magic). The chemistry between the actors was also spot on. I enjoyed that throughout the story the characters bring up themes around loneliness, death, love, emotions, family - existential aspects we all hold close to us.Great direction and cinematography, nothing less than expected from Tim Burton. The music accompanying the show is syncing amazingly with the scenes. He takes you to another of his magical worlds with the Addams family in the centre of it.",9
North America,"Going by the fact Netflix was producing this and the promos were making this show out to be ""CW-esque"", my expectations were pretty low. The only reason I gave it shot was because it's more or less a spinoff of The Addams Family.And after slogging through a lot of poorly paced and terribly written western TV shows this year like Rings of Power, various MCU shows, and whatever Alex Kurtzman passes off as Star Trek these days, ""Wednesday"" is like an Oasis in a desert.The show is basically Veronica Mars with Wednesday Addams, or a Goth version of Nancy Drew for those who never watched the former. What that means for the layman is that it's a murder mystery show with Wednesday Addams being our titular detective at the center of it all. And oddly enough, the premise actually works.The first episode does a good job of setting up the premise and introducing all the characters, quickly establishing everyone's relationship dynamics and their place in the show. And most importantly the main plot thread of this season-a mysterious creature that randomly kills people around town, and several seemingly unrelated side mysteries.So, every episode is usually juggling multiple plot threads at once, whether that be character building moments or making progress on one of the several different mysteries running simultaneously. Every scene serves a purpose, which more than I can say about Andor or Rings of Power, which both squander or pad out their runtime with pointless filler or stretching out an already thin plot.Now the all important question, is it woke? Yes & No. It does have a diverse cast of characters, yet it doesn't feel like they're going off a checklist. Most of the men in the show aren't doormats for the female characters, save for a couple of them-and even then they do stand up for themselves when they're pushed to far.None of the female characters are infallible, including Wednesday herself. While she does excel at many things; she's not invincible, nor is she perfect, and surprisingly she is wrong from time to time. And she does have to rely on other people-a good bit of them being men. The biggest surprise is that she actually loves & respects her father Gomez-she's actually grateful for all the things he's taught her over the years.She makes a few obvious snipes about ""the patriarchy"" and people ""mansplaining"" to her, but they are few and far between and even then the people she's saying this to either don't know what she's talking about or they're rolling their eyes at her, and never dwell on it-kinda the same way shows like ""Daria"" use to do it back in the day, but in this instance it's to a lesser degree. And unlike most female protagonists these days, Wednesday actually tries to learn from her mistakes, and experiences some personal growth.And there's like one lesbian couple in the show, who are parents of one of the side characters, but they're not obnoxious about their inclusion, they're just there.Does it bash White people for no apparent reason? Actually, it never comes up. At least not overtly. They do make references to the colonial days where they use to burn witches (or in this case outcasts) at the stake, so to speak. But the race of said people were never brought up.Are Minorities (POCs) treated like the paragons of virtue that can do no wrong? Nope, they're treated like regular people/characters with no special treatment, and fill a wide variety of roles in the story like any other character would.So, yes it's diverse, but diverse in a more organic way. And all the characters have a story arc, even some the antagonists experience some growth. Nobody stays static in this show.After binge watching this show in one sitting, I'm really looking forward to what they're going to do next season.",9
North America,"Wednesday is a gothic introverted show that is spooky and quite simply awesome and I have watched it twice now, it's worth the watch.I absolutely love the story, the actors are fantastic and the Edgar Allan Poe references are just superb. The detective work that Wednesday does is easy to follow along too and of course her intelligent remarks about the school and the town are enjoyable.Jenna Ortega as Wednesday makes the show, she literally took a fictional character and made her absolutely outstanding. Straight away you are hooked, her mannerisms and the way she speaks in multiple languages make her a very intriguing character.The fashion alone in the show is calming and completely matches everyone and everything within the story. I found every character interesting and the acting very convincing, this honestly helps the story because you really want to find out ""Who done it?!""I adore Tim Burtons work, he is one of my favourite directors. Danny Elfmans music makes every scene either suspenseful or spooky. It's a really great way to add to the scene, so you don't have to rely on the visuals alone, audio is a great clue.The storyline makes complete sense and it really does make you go ""omg no way!""
I really do recommend watching this show, it's perfect for any introvert who loves spooky and fantastical shows or movies. Better yet this show is great for all the quirky people out there that are simply different.",10
North America,"When i first saw this poster for the show i was super excited since i used to love Adams Family! And guess what... This did not disappoint!First of all, the actors were fantastic but especially Jenna Ortega. The cast worked great together and i could feel the chemistry though my screen.This show was not what i was expecting out of an Adams Family reboot but i think Tim Burton did an amazing job with giving Wednesday a new storyline and background. This show came with a lot of fun but insane twists that will leave your jaw on the floor every episode. And to be completely honest i wasn't expecting that last one which just shows how unpredictable this show can be! Definitly one of my favorites this year.",9
North America,"Not the worst thing I've watched but was disappointed in the show. Plot is pretty predictable, and I agree with others how the Addams family are weird and unique but then to throw them in a whole world with vampires, werewolves and sirens(and even more), they are no longer that weird and unique. Especially Wednesday, the actress that played her did wonderful but the actual character was just a teenager who was clearly miserable like most of the other teenagers out in the world. I think the only thing that saved this show enough for it to be rated 5 stars was its humour which again was delivered by Wednesday and also Thing.The character Enid is terrible and extremely annoying. Very unrelatable and wouldn't be any 16 year old in reality.... She was just so over the top. I understand them wanting to create a character that is opposite to Wednesday, but they either need to hire a better actress or tone down the character because it just didn't deliver. It also made her seem extremely childish compared to the rest of the cast, even Bianca who acted childish for most of the series. That's just how bad Enid was.Now let's talk about the hyde and Enid's wolf. For Enid's over the top, annoying and too colourful character, she gets to turn into THE ugliest wolf. The sirens in the show look beautiful and creates more of a magical atmosphere, but I was disappointed to see that Enid's wolf looked so much like the hyde monster. Was just not fitting. The hyde is supposed to be creepy and that but again why would you make Enid's wolf look so awful given that her character is so colourful? Especially after she spends the whole season worrying if she's going to change into a wolf or not. Expected her to change into the most elegant and beautiful wolf and attack this monster and come out stronger from the experience. It just made me not want to vouch for her even more.Lastly, I think this isn't a terrible watch but honestly I can't say I'm on the edge of my seat anticipating every moment working up to season 2(which their most likely will be). I also feel these higher reviews are from people that either don't care about the flaws of this series or have fallen head over heels for Wednesday(and the actress that plays her). Because really she saved the series but still wouldn't be able to rate higher given the amount of flaws in this series.",5
North America,"Been loving this series. I like the spin on this series, but no surprise here. Me and my family Love horror, dark themed things, and anything Tim Burton!! If you like Addams family, Sabrina the Teenage Witch, or the new darker Riverdale, you will probably enjoy. It's like mixing Addams family with Monster High and the new Sabrina the Teenage Witch. The casting has been perfect. It also gives Wednesday more depth and seems as though it'll add more depth to the rest of the Addams. A nice dark detective-like series with goth and monster influence. The more gorey details with blood and big deep cuts or slashes are a fun addition.",10
North America,"I won't go into long detail about the story line other than that it follows Wednesday as she gets sent off to boarding school and separates from the Addams Family but I will say that the acting is great, the story is fun, the directing is on point and Thing should have always had stitches (it just looks better). They did this show right! They didn't put a bunch of BS in it like more and more shows are doing now days, they just stuck to what it is put in great effort and I think it's going to pay off. Really hoping for and looking forward to more seasons on Wednesday. Kudos to Netflix, Tim Burton, the actors and everyone involved- a job well done.",8
North America,"I loved all the movies of Family Addams and was very happy, but skeptic when I heard that they would do a serie on Wednesday. I was hooked from the first minutes. The character of Wednesday Addams is beautifully interpreted by Jenna Ortega. Thing is always so funny and I love uncle Fester. However, Morticia and Gomez lacked the chemistry and charm that the actors gave them in the movies. Hopefully, they were not often on screen so they do not influence my rating of the tv show. I loved the contrast between Wednesday and Enid. Enid is such a good character and I loved that each characters were so well rounded. So much action and emotions... I binged watched the tv show in less than 2 days. What a show! I really hope they will do a season 2! Watch it you will love it! If you loved the movies you might have some places where you find that this show is not accurate. However, the story is captivating.",9
North America,"Ok, so we have Wednesday Addams - from the Addams family who is meeting vampires and werewolves etc in a teenage drama/detective mystery in a Hogwarts/Veronica Mars/Riverdale setting. Wednesday begins to have visions, becomes an amateur detective in a murder mystery, gets drawn into a love triangle, and learns to socialize. So teenage drama.This is not necessary a bad idea though - the original series basically had one pitch only. The Addams family is an family where every-thing is the opposite of what is expected. They hate cute, nice things like dogs and happyness and love vile, strange things like torture, swamps, depression and dangerous beasts. The creepy and the kooky but also the dangerous (even if the 60s show in general was a bit tame) and every episode had normal society interact with them in some way. This was followed by the later 90s movies - movies with great actors but with a script that was a bit so-so and too much focus on Fester. In short - Addams need to branch out a bit.In this spin-off, Wednesday is getting the focus due to the characters popularity from Christinas Riccis acting in said 90s movies. She has clearly grown to high school age (she was very young in the 60s show and very underused) and is enrolling in a Hogwarts like place for freaks and outcasts. Again not a bad idea. However, while I get that they want to focus more on the sarcastic and antisocial parts of the Addams brand, the character was also sadistic and death-obsessed. The initial Piranha scene works well, but then she becomes way too sympathetic. Not necessary a huge problem, but her Addams Root is weakened - you could have simply invent a new girl, remove the Addams name entirely and go for that. In addition, the script in general is pretty weak. Its a bit too generic, too YA for it to really work. They should allow more gore, maybe letting Wednesday murder, torture or maim a classmate or something. I get that you could call it growth - but I am not sure I want to see her character evolve that much. In some episodes she is joined by other members of the family, but their scenes are mostly forgettable. The show is not about the family.However, this is saved by in general good acting and a pretty decent Tim Burton aesthetic. I would call it amazing, buts decent and cute and that can be enough. Just don´t do in expecting something really creative and unique here and if you are a hardcore Addams fan, you might want to skip this completely, since the focus isn´t really on the family and their kookyness. But it is very charming and that can be enough.",7
North America,"I walked into watching this thinking it was going to be great, bring back some much loved childhood memories and amaze me. Jenna Ortega managed to make Wednesday into a far more interesting character and her recital on the rooftop was brilliant not to mention the Nothing Else Matters overture at times.Even if you have never watched the original material, anyone can pick this show up and have a woefully great time. Thing for example manages to amuse, entertain and leave questions ""Where the hell is the rest of him?"" not to mention ""How do they get Thing to be alive?""Well worth watching and I look forward to more.",10
North America,"It's like the Addams family , Harry Potter and a series of unfortunate events had a child. This is better than I expected! To me Christina Ricci will ALWAYS be Wednesday but wow, Jenna Ortega really brings it! It's witty and fun and is a fun watch. Im super excited to see where this show goes!!!Jenna Ortega as Wednesday Adam's is truly fun. She nails the cold dark vibe to Wednesday , the no smile , the dark eyes and the iconic pigtails. The way she delivers her lines is a great start to this show. Her wardrobe is fun ( even if it's just a uniform). And we can't forget about thing! Truly a good time.",8
North America,"Jenna Ortega IS Wednesday Addams. The young actress is the center of the TV series and definitely she is perfect for the role. If you are looking for a worthy option to watch after Harry Potter film franchise, this is it. It's a delicious dark dramedy where you have smart writing giving great black humor along with a compelling mystery, all wrapped in a respectful lore of The Addams Family. Maybe Gomez and Morticia could be better performed but after all, this is not about them, this is about Wednesday, this is her show and as I already told you, Jenna Ortega just nailed an improved version of the character even way better than the film version by Christina Ricci but never forget her since that actress appears in the new TV series too. Also Gwendoline Christie shows her wonderful acting skills as the mysterious principal of Nevermore Academy. Moreover almost all the characters are well done and giving value to the story. Totally recommended and without a doubt, this masterpiece from the mind of Tim Burton is one of the best new TV series of 2022.",10
North America,"Wow where to begin!Jenna Ortega totally owns the role as Wednesday Addams. She portrays the incredibly intelligent and witty script perfectly..she totally nails it. Her eyes are ridiculously mesmerising, the feelings she manages to relay through them is simply unbelievable.Tim Burton is a genius and i thank him immensely for bringing Wednesday to all of us.Luis Guzmán as Gomez & Catherine Zeta-Jones as Morticia were perfectly cast as Wednesday's parents.Gwendoline Christie as Nevermore's principle was fantastic.Mr. Victor Dorobantu...although we never saw you..we all saw your hand as you played Thing! Being Wednesdays side kick and protector we thought you were amazing..how a scarred hand can be cute is hard to describe but it's true.I was greatly impressed after watching an amazing 8 episodes..thank you to everyone involved and looking forward to season 2! Bravo!",10
North America,"I only watched the first episode of Wednesday and feel uncertain about continuing with the series. The music and special effects are amazing! As well as the actress who plays Wednesday. The huge downfall is that in the series, Wednesday and the Addams Family are seen as ""mean spirited."" That is not how the original series was at all. In the original series, The Addams Family, the family loved being weird, and could not understand why a normal society, (seen as strange to the family) could not accept them. They still loved each other, and were kind and considerate to each other. The pairings of John Astin and Carolyn Jones as Gomez and Mortica, along with Ken Weatherwax as Pugsley. And Lisa Loring as Wednesday showed a family that loved and cared about each other. Who all liked to do strange things. But they almost never had evil intent to hurt others. In contrast, they would feel puzzled about why a visitor's behavior in their home would feel strange to them. To the Addams Family, they saw their world as perfectly normal, but very rarely would they act or react with threats of violence, unless a visitor was really a threat to them. However, the Netflix series, Wednesday tries to compensate the flawed premise of Wednesday Addams being evil, by using great music and special effects. The result is brilliant CGI animation and music. But this can't save the flawed characterization of Wednesday as mean-spirited, when the real Wednesday Addams was not. Fans of the classic 1960's show may want to stick with the original series for these reasons.",5
North America,"First Impressions:Wednesday Addams... The name needs no introduction, at least not to fans of the ""Addams Family"" franchise. This series captured Wednesday's experiences as a student in a frightfully fantastic gothic light that made it everything, and more, that fans like myself have been expecting to see. If you consider this show a live-action version of the 1992 cartoon series, many of the creative elements you'll discover as you go will make exponentially more sense.The Crew:Tim Burton, Gandja Monteiro, James Marshall did exemplary work directing this series. They captured some nice yesteryear ""Addams"" vibes while including some newfangled twists.Alfred Gough, Miles Millar, Kayla Alpert, April Blair, Matt Lambert's writing was aces and deserves high praise. It might not have been easy to script a series of episodes around a multi-generational fan-favourite character, but they succeeded in that endeavour.Chris Bacon and Danny Elfman's musical scoring was brilliant. It was a balance of familiar and fresh that will be an auditory treat for fans of this franchise. The soundtracks were great as well, especially the covers and instrumentals.David Lanzenberg and Stephan Pehrsson's cinematography contained a world of captivation and wonder. It was immersive in all the right ways.Mark Scruton's production design was great.Set decoration and art direction were superb.Editing, sound effects, and VFX were amazing.Hair-makeup and Colleen Atwood's costume design were outstanding.The stunts team did remarkable work.The Cast:Jenna Ortega as Wednesday Addams was perfection. She also double-acted as Goody Addams, her distant ancestor.Christina Ricci as Marilyn Thornhill was nostalgic and brilliant.Gwendoline Christie as Principal Larissa Weems was unforgettable.Isaac Ordonez as Pugsley Addams was good.Catherine Zeta-Jones as Morticia Addams was interesting.Luis Guzmán as Gomez Addams was funny and good.Fred Armisen as Uncle Fester was noteworthy.George Burcea as Lurch was good.Victor Dorobantu as Thing (the hand) was an amazing addition to the show. His 'character design' was great.Hunter Doohan as Tyler Galpin was outstanding.Emma Myers as Enid Sinclair was captivating.Georgie Farmer as Ajax Petropolus was memorable.Percy Hynes White as Xavier Thorpe was notable.Calum Ross as Rowan Laslow was quite good.Joy Sunday as Bianca Barclay was enchanting.Riki Lindhome as Dr Valerie Kinbott was good.Jamie McShane as Sheriff Donovan Galpin was great.Moosa Mostafa as Eugene Otinger was engaging.Sophia Nomvete as Connie Jorgensen was a pleasant surprise.William Houston as Joseph Crackstone was good.Gracy Goldman as Gabrielle (Bianca's siren mother) was captivating.Amanda Drew as Esther Sinclair (Enid's werewolf mother) was quite good.Plot Summary & Analysis:Wednesday Addams went to school *snap snap*. Classic ""Addams"" vibes and relevant corny-cool elements enriched the series to no end. I loved how they gave enough freedom to Tim Burton to work his singular magic on the show. How could I tell? The quality contained in every episode spoke for itself. Netflix made an impeccable decision in choosing Burton to tell this story and tell it right.I admired how they covered Wednesday's emergent psychic abilities. They made her a heroine who didn't desire to follow in the footsteps of her parents - Morticia (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and Gomez (Luis Guzmán). Those portions of the script were compelling and credible. After all, nearly every young girl and boy will find themselves in a position where they need to express their own individuality. This plot-thread mattered in connection with Wednesday's motivations.Now, let's face it, Christina Ricci previously did a brilliant job capturing the heart (so to speak) and soul (again, in a manner of speaking) of Wednesday Addams. It therefore pleased me to see Jenna Ortega seamlessly recreate the character in this series while still giving it her own spin.Speaking of Ricci, I was enormously impressed and overjoyed to watch her being re-cast in the show as Marilyn Thornhill, one of the teachers at Nevermore Academy. It spoke to Ricci's humility and versatility as a person and an actress to even have said yes to the role. Then again, when Tim Burton calls, any creative soul will answer.Two schools were in focus in season 1 of ""Wednesday"". Nancy Reagan High (initial portions, anyway) and Nevermore Academy. Both brought their own admirable elements to bear on the script. As for Nevermore, it gave off distinct Hogwarts vibes; if Hogwarts were American and smaller. Nevertheless, every inch of Nevermore was 'awe-chitectural' eye-candy to me.I also liked the older-sister vibe Wednesday brought, especially how she took care of her little brother Pugsley (who gave an interesting performance, btw).As for Catherine Zet-Jones, she paled (pun unintended) in comparison to her predecessor Angelica Huston who owned this character in subtle and sensual ways. However, Zeta-Jones' emotional scenes were something to behold. Luis Guzmán was great as his own kind of Gomez but, again, he lacked the energized je ne sais quoi Raul Julia originally brought to the character.Their younger versions, though - Gwen Jones as Morticia and Lucius Hoyos as Gomez - gave us criminally brief moments of the classic goth-couple vibe that fans have come to adore about these two iconic characters.Fester was a mischief-crazy addition to the cast, but he wasn't given too much screen time this season. Lurch (George Burcea) was interesting and looked the part, but was barely given screen space. I was looking forward to hearing him give that signature exasperated moan, which never came.Gwendoline Christie as Principal Larissa Weems was a perfect fit for this franchise. I've always been a fan of her work, so I was glad to see her shine in this role.The storyline in ""Wednesday"" 2022 was neat and elegant. It evoked ""Addams Family"" moments I remember cherishing when I watched the 1991 movie (directed by Barry Sonnenfeld) and the 1992 animated series that aired on Cartoon Network.Back to Wednesday's psychic capabilities... This was new. It wasn't exactly confirmed in any of the other characterizations of Wednesday over the years. The way they delivered this plot-point, especially the style with which they used Wednesday's newly blooming psychic skills to lend her an air of gravitas and power, was splendid. I thought I would come to dislike this inclusion in the overall story, but I ended up giving it my vote.In addition, Wednesday proved to be quite the detective, particularly when it came to solving a series of monster murders - the creature was known as a ""Hyde"" - that took place around Nevermore. Making her a savvy sleuth truly elevated the show from anything that came before it in the Addams-verse. Instead of sardonically or sarcastically pointing out the obvious, Wednesday instead found opportunities to collect and connect clues to help solve serious issues.They even gave her character a nice literary touch. Wednesday writing novels as a hobby was captivating, to say the least. Her fictional cases were conducted by a girl-detective named Viper De la Muerte who was quite like the author herself in several regards. In addition to moments like these, so many other features in the show displayed a flair and fervour for traditional old-school ""Addams"" wordplay and tropes.From martial arts to fencing, cello playing to classic line-deliveries, I loved everything about Wednesday Addams and Jenna Ortega's take on the character in this Netflix series. Her dance in E04 was groovy (word intended), The Cramps' ""Goo Goo Muck"" soundtrack was perfect, some evocative steps from past Wednesdays made me fan-scream, and the ""Carrie at the prom"" finish (especially in regards to Gwendoline Christie's contribution) was brilliant!Also, I managed to guess the identity of the Hyde monster early on, but Burton and company wove their red herrings so cunningly that I could never quite be sure until the actual reveal (rather, bold-faced confession) happened. It was simple but effective misdirection worth admiring.Superb characterizations all round, captivating back-stories, and noteworthy pacing were some of the many elements that made this show an iconic production to hail from Netflix this year.Final Notes:In just eight episodes, Wednesday proved that capturing the old ""Addams Family"" magic was not impossible if summoned by the right hands. I do believe that Tim Burton made this Netflix series work in more ways than one. Christina Ricci did not disappoint, either.The series contained a little bit of everything, from school-time sentiments and crime-drama tropes to horrors and comedies galore. It portrayed the Nevermore alumni as a batch of oddities and outcasts, who included vampires, werewolves, gorgons, and sirens. All of it gave Netflix's ""Wednesday"" multi-pronged possibilities to use in future.By the time season 1 ended, I was genuinely weighed down by sadness to realize it was over and that Netflix was yet to greenlight a season 2 of ""Wednesday"". Hopefully they will, and soon. Otherwise, in classic Wednesday Addams fashion, someone is going to have to drop a bag of live piranhas in the executives' private swimming pool if only to remind them they have a great thing going here.",9
North America,"I was so surprised at how kiddyish this show was. I knew it would be a generic Netflix show with their typical style and flavours restricting it from being anything too original, but I didn't know just how ""Young Adult"" and silly it would be. I guessed every single twist and every single reason for everything and I wasn't even trying. It was all too obvious. The monster looked laughable, and the drama... Honestly this show reminded me of Stargirl or something else from the CW. It's rated 15+ but it's just SO kiddyish and silly. The character Wednesday has had everything interesting and kooky about her stripped away and now she's just some Daria clone who just talks without emotion and has no other defining character trait. This looked and felt way too silly for a show supposed to be for older teens and adults. It's feels like a show that was made for a 13 year old girl. Extremely unsatisfying show that took everything fun and kooky about Addams family and just made a Netflix cookie cutter Riverdale/Stargirl clone that is predictable as heck, and insanely kiddyish.Ps. Take a shot every time someone says 'Patriarchy' in this show or any other Netflix produced series, and you'd be dead. Bonus shots for 'mansplaining' to really seal the deal. Seriously, Netflix is cringe.",4
North America,"It's good... as an entertainment.The series doesn't do what it proposed to: Show the teenagers how to deal with themselves. But that doesn't happen. It proposed to be so amazing and have that nostalgia taste for the older ones and lessons to the younger ones, but it doesn't. The show just looks like a homemade movie inspired in Addam's Family. There's so much information in a short period of time that we can't process so many plots. We need to have notebooks to write down the wide range of loose ends. As a teenager show, the route tries to have created a romantic air, but never has a conclusion in it. No matter how the show tries, just make it's worse. The show tries to adapt the history of a really deep character, Wednesday, opening she sides wide, as being gothic and also adapting itself to the colorful ambient. The show tries so hard to do it that can't take deeper the act of Wednesday or none of the characters, making them so egoistic as their original generation's and so egoistic as the crew generation. The Show fails to represent teenagers in general that seems the whole series has been taken out of American Pie or, as the show promotes, TikTok videos. The series just confirm to the public how a big production can't show in a real form how the so-called ""Gen Z"" is. The performance of the cast is amazing, but doesn't is in the right place.They should pick actors and actresses literally with 12-17 years old, as it was supposed to be. The job of cast that was picked was excellent and express the stereotype that all people are all the time trying not to be.",5
North America,"So I binge watched Wednesday and finished it Thanksgiving morning.I thought it was utterly brilliant.Jenna Ortega is incredible.While keeping Wednesday's stoic facial expressions, she does a phenomenal job of communicating through her eyes, the emotions being the stoic facade.Emma Meyers Enid was the perfect counter to Wednesday. The bubbly colorful roomie was perfect.The adults were well cast. It took me a little time to adapt to a Gomez Addams that wasn't Suave and Debonair like John Aston or Raul Julia.The mysteries were the perfect tool to drive the story.I can't wait for season two!",10
North America,I've always liked the Adam's Family. Mainly the black and white tv show but I have to admit this was pretty entertaining. I pretty much binge watched it with forced intermissions for life. Tim Burton has always been one of my favorites but lately had fallen off my radar. I was a huge fan of Beetlejuice and the Keaton Batman movies and this gave me the same nostalgia. There is definitely a strong pull to the Adam's Family of old but this is definitely an update with a woeful flair. Jenna Ortega was simply terrific and Christina Ricci was a wonderful nod but also refreshing to see how quirky wonderful she is. I also have to admit Fred Armisen is not my favorite actor but as Fester he was amazing. Hopefully this continues ........ The END?,10
North America,"After watching the trailer, I was excited to see where Tim Burton and Danny Elfman were going with this and it is without a doubt, one of the best series that Netflix has ever put out. The dark and intertwining juxtapositions of everything that one has ever seen either on television or the movies in the realms of horror and history is packaged in a beautiful symphony of the macabre, including dark laughs. Jenna Ortega is the find of the 21st Century. Her portrayal of Wednesday Addams is dead on and magnetic to watch on the screen. Now we know how that sweet girl in the TV series became what she is today and Ortega delivers it hook, line and sinker. The storytelling keeps you captivated and never idiotic or redundant in it's delivery. I am glad that Luis Guzman's portrayal of Gomez is reflected from the comics, not even insulting the fans who loved John Astin and Raul Julia in their roles as Gomez.Catherine Zeta Jones's portrayal as Morticia is great and relish every scene she is in.I have only watched one episode and I will stand by my review until the end. I hope that this series continues onwards in further seasons. I hope Netfilx delivers the 2nd season during Halloween, it would be so appropriate due to the nature of the show. Thank you Tim Burton for great direction and Danny Elfman for a music score that ranks as high as his previous works such as Batman and countless other Tim Burton movies.",10
North America,"I have been looking forward to this show ever since it was announced, especially when I heard that the great Tim Burton would be at the controls. Well, let me say to all of the Tim Burton and/or Addams Family fans out there (which are legion) that you are in for a treat. This show is funny, scary, mysterious, suspenseful, and - above all - incredibly entertaining. Yes, the stories are completely ridiculous and make very little sense, but you won't care because it's so much fun to watch. Most of all, though, the biggest credit for the greatness of this show has to go to the amazing Jenna Ortega as the titular Ice Queen. Her performance is easily Emmy-worthy. Make no mistake - put this show on your must-watch list as soon as you can.",10
North America,"First, let me say that if you're looking for the comedy and playfulness of the original TV series or the movies (I haven't seen the direct-to-video version or the cartoon), you'll be looking long and hard. There are some comical moments, some outrightly silly and some dark humor, but ""this is not your father's Oldsmobile,"" as the saying goes.The casting of Ortega was magnificent. She captures the spirit of Wednesday and does display emotion sparingly and only when appropriate. Catherine Zeta-Jones was a nice Morticia. I was unhappy with Luis Guzman until Wednesday breathed a sigh of relief at his acquittal (I won't offer a spoiler about it) and said she was sure he didn't have it in him to be a murderer. The look on his face was priceless. It was an almost, ""Well, I'm happy you're happy, but I thought I was all scary and such."" I think I laughed harder at that look than at anything else in the show.It's a good mystery, a fair bit of horror, and a good dose of dark humor and sadness mixed into a thoroughly enjoyable outing. Since it ended on a small cliffhanger, I am hoping it doesn't get the Netflix axe treatment that so many decent shows seem to be getting. I look forward to a season 2 and am eagerly awaiting to see if they can capture the same spirit they started with.",9
North America,"It's Tim Burton's magical touch that transforms us into a spooky yet beautiful world of Wednesday where everything is black and white for her, He made sure that we all get carried into his world of spookiness and enchantment and yet mortal world.Wednesday stands tall on her terms, which sparked the likeness of others towards her.The emptiness of her soul yet empathy towards the end adds tremendous magic to the show,
And the reason I fell in love with her character.All the supporting characters are well played to add more value to Wednesday's life.It's about unconditional love, friendships are pure and simple.",10
North America,"I started watching it because of Jenna Ortega and without knowing what to expect from the series and what it was about, but it was unexpectedly good and interesting, I recommend it for everyone who's interested in mysteries and sci-fi. It's the best adaptation of the Adams family, like I was never interested in movies which were related to the Adams family before but this series is different a lot better then the movies out there and other adaptations about the Adam family. It's entertaining and grabs your attention from the first episode till the end.I am hoping for a season 2 and more, loved it and it was worth my time.",10
North America,"I did not expect to like it so much. The story got me curious from the very beginning, I watched the TV series in 2 days. Now I have to wait for season 2, I hope it's coming soon. The actors were great (can we have a moment and appreciate how fine Tyler is? Thank you). I was surprised (and also happy) that it was filmed in my country, Romania. Eugene is my favorite character and I hope he gets more screen time in the following season.Jenna Ortega did a wonderful job playing Wednesday, she is an amazing actress and I hope she will get other bigger roles too. She truly deserves it.Please give a chance to this TV series, it might surprise you as well.",10
North America,I really didnt know what to think before I started watching. But I started watching and could not stop. So I watched it all and its great. It has that odd fuzzy feeling to it that Tim Burton movies have about them. But well all 8 episodes. What I remember from addams family it seems to be lore friendly it has a few absolutely lovely easter eggs for the sharp eyed viewer. The characters are fleshed out and do thing for a reason and arent just stupid for the sake of the lore like in Chilling Adventures of Sabrina. There is a villian or two and they are fleshed out too and not just bad for the sake of lore. Also the villiand arent overpowered like in many fantasy series so it kind of makes sense. Oh and the acting was great too. Ortega is great as Wednesday and Myers brough great contrast to the show as Enid. Also costums location and filming all great. And the thing is still my second favorite thing about the Addams family.,9
North America,"I was pleasantly surprised by how great this series turned out. It truly does keep you guessing with enthralling mysteries and adventures, and it adapts the Addams Family franchise in such a fun, creative way, though I never had much of a connection to it prior to this viewing. Wednesday and Co. Are very likable characters that you want to stick around for, brought to life by an incredible cast. There are some characters and plot lines that could have been developed better, as well as some of the humor being somewhat repetitive. However, I really want to see more of Wednesday's Nevermore experiences in a 2nd season.",7
North America,"Hit play by accident on this one. Glad I did.This was nothing like what I expected. The remake movie was not appealing at all to one who grew up with the Addams Family. This series doesn't imitate the movie at all.The actress who plays Wednesday did an amazing job of carrying the whole series. She started off coming across similar to Jeri Ryan's portrayal of 7 of 9 but by the end of the second episode had well and truly made it her own.This version is less child friendly than the movie and the original as it is quite dark, but having said that, there's little in there that's not suitable.Half hoping there's a second series coming and half not, as they won't top season 1.",9
North America,"Beautiful and interesting title of year. But in 1st episode they make 1 sad mistake which does not fit in my head. When the girls are brought, ostensibly, a black orchid, we see something like an aster. Not even Orchidaceae. A very stupid and painful mistake for normal viewers. After all, you can literally buy an orchid in a store, at least paint it black. Or God bless him, plastic.I hope there will be no further such mistakes, because according to the Addams, to do something suitable is to have experience and skill.I hope there will be no further such mistakes, because according to the Addams, to do something suitable is to have experience and skill.I will stick to principle until the end of the season. So far they have few competitors. Yes, and on New Year's Eve, good luck)",9
North America,"I was a big Addams family fan growing up, could even say Christina Ricci's Wednesday might even have been my first ever crush, i was excited by the trailer and have been looking to see how the show turned out. I have to say i was very amused with this show. Jenna Ortega nails Wednesday maybe even more than Christina Ricci did. Great story keeps you guessing untill the end. Great supporting characters wasn't sure about it at first but its really well done. Some great cameo's and good choice for Gomez and Morticia too. There's room for more let's just hope it's as well thought out as this one can't wait to see more.",9
North America,"Wednesday, the gothic daughter of the Addams family, is getting her own mini series on Netflix - how does the young Addams do, since she is a misfit even in a school for misfits? Jenna Ortega is the perfect choice for playing Wednesday.Bad, sensitive, especially towards her brother, a bad wolf, rational and talkative in black and white - that's one The Addams Family fan knows and loves Little Wednesday (Ortega)! But she also needs to be successful and above all to reach her full potential. Nevermore Academy should take care of her, where her parents met and fell in love...Growing up with the Addams family, I never thought a retelling of the beloved family would be any good.Dang, I was so wrong.Even the idea of the thing was in my perception boring in todays day and age.Boy, even there I was wrong.Just watch and make up your own opinion. It really was touching me in creepy ways...",9
North America,"Surpassed my expectations. Beside the fact they did Morticia and Gomez dirty, the show was overall impeccable. It had been a long time since Netflix made such a good series. The plot was unexpected and quite interesting. The whole story made you work your brain cells to try and find who the murderers were. It was very entertaining and not cliché which is surprising from Netflix. I loved how Wednesday never got really soft or had a major character development. She stayed true to herself, I enjoyed her character deeply. The way she didn't care and openly admitted to it was a first. It was like all those others maim protagonists who pretend they don't care, she truly didn't and it was amazing.I strongly recommend watching and hope for a second season.",10
North America,"The first trailer had me interested, the cast and creative team had me intrigued, the first episode had be hooked and the final one has left me yearning for more.Jenna Ortega who plays the lead of the show - ""Wednesday"" herself, brings such a unique performance to the role yet makes it feel nostalgic and reminiscent of those who came before her. Speaking of which, it was incredibly smart to bring back Christina Ricci for a role in this show as a nice easter egg for the fans of the prior. Ortega fully embraced the character and ""became"" her on another level. Time for me to check out more of her work for sure!The cinematography is very ""Tim Burton-ish"" with a modern twist to it. You can feel his directive presence throughout the entire show. The writers did an incredible job as well to take an already existing iconic character - which is a bold move - and dive deeper into her personal story and life. The music and sound design was also very much like the theme of the show and the previous ones. The nailed the atmosphere and overall vibe for me really well.I was afraid at first that they would ""normalize"" Wednesday too much. After all, I feel she should remain an intriguing and morbid character with surely a lot of underlying depth underneath her deadpan witty personality. She was exactly that in this show and I'm very happy about that. Wednesday remains to be an absolute boss, as she should be. She was humanized in subtle ways and with slow steps without forcing any narratives or uncharacteristic traits.The acting was pristine. Jenna Ortega was the perfect pick for the role and she crushed it. Her co-stars manage to not disappoint either next to a presence like hers. Gwendoline Christie's character surprised me a lot. Her performance (subtle emotion, motivation, traits) elevated her character and transformed her from a ""somewhat"" antagonist to a beloved, awesome figure whos presence was constantly felt throughout the show. I was also presently surprised by Hunter Doohan and Emma Myers, whom respectively play Tyler and Enid. Great things await these brilliant actors.I thought the casting of the other Addams' family members was just perfect and worked well as an addition to the show. The way ""Thing"" moves and communicates brought back some very nostalgic feels, I love It. The twists were great and some more unexpected than others. The detective-ish theme of the show had me hooked from the beginning 'till the end. I truly hope they'll release more seasons, which I assume they will since this show will no doubt break the internet. Not doing so would woe my mind.",9
North America,"If anyone is on the fence about watching Wednesday, watch it, it's very good, the cast, direction, plot and style are all excellent except for two things.Gomez and Morticia are awful, awful actors acting awfully and completely miss the passion of the characters reducing them to the effect of teenagers in the back of a pickup truck, but thankfully they aren't in the series much.Morticia doesn't spark the dark sarcastic cold note of the character but hams it up not in a good way.Gomez is a parody of a great character who is meant to me stylish, debonair, witty, clever and focussed on the love of his life being everything. This character depiction is reduced to stupid hair, acting like he's a teenager with raging hormones and awful one liners referring to Wednesday. It's an awful depiction in my opinion.Thankfully they are only in the series a couple of episodes and I'm hoping that will continue in series 2
I cannot imagine that there won't be a second series as there is so much to love about it.Enid and Wednesday are perfectly cast as are the rest of the crew and the plot will twist and turn sufficiently to entertain and make you laugh etc.",9
North America,"Very well made ! Excellent story line with lots of parallel story lines to keep you on your toes definitely not just another teenage show it's beautiful and complex displaying lots of topics including change growth friendship and relationships I love how they made it relevant to today and now with the little gen Z slang. Spot on when it comes to casting ! Specially when they show their younger "" selves "" . The cast did an phenomenal job acting all the characters the vfx are brilliant. And to top it all off the music and sound effects were my fav part of it all ! I had to pause and search the sound tracks! Can't wait for the next season ????",10
North America,"Had high hopes for this as I love the Addams Family films, but this series is just terrible.It doesn't have any of the dark humour from the films, apparently the directors washed it down for the overly sensitive generation z for fear they will attempt top copy everything done in the film in real life. You can really tell it is washed down, to the point it is terrible.The setting of the series feels like a complete rip off of the Harry Potter story...
A school for unique kids (vampires/werewolves) instead of wizards.4 school societies, just like harry potter.A championship between the societies, just like the quidditch game where people tried to sabotage other teams.Pugsly is portrayed as a wimp instead of the confident prankster.The casting seems poor too, gomez and tich had no proper romance between them, it seems very cheesy. They are also normal parents, ashamed of their kids bad behaviour instead of proud of it.Also, why they made Luis look so weird I don't understand.Wednesday, a sadist and social recluse starts making friends and has romantic feelings towards someone... This alone screams it's watered down for overly sensitive young kids.Very disappointing overall.",1
North America,"Wednesday is Tim Burton his young-adult take on the Addam's Family story and it shows. Everything about this show feels alive and kicking. From the surprisingly cool murder mystery story to the set designs, customes, music and even the faces of the actors, everything just works to bring the absurdity to life. Blending the over-the-top world of this spooky family with Burton's masterful macabre abilities feels like a masterstroke, quickly elevating this to one of Netflix their current top shows.The support of castmembers such as Zeta-Jones and the original Wednesday Christina Ricci certainly helps, but it's young Jenna Ortega who steals the show effortlessly. Her ice-cold depiction of deeply sarcastic Wednesday Addams is of Antarctic-freeze levels and will leave you all warm and fuzzy when watching her bend her entire world to her dark and brooding will.A must see for any Tim Burton fan and anyone who loves some dark comedy really. It's alive.",9
North America,"I've grown up with the Addams family and watched the show BEFORE it went into syndication :)I read some of the BAD reviews and almost didn't watch the show but glad I did. I binged it in one day because I had to know who the monster was.I found it entertaining, intriguing and well acted. All the nuances of the original Addams family such as the ""You rang""... the double snapping of fingers... and even the night time angles of the school looked EXACTLY like the Addams family mansion.I gladly look forward to more seasons of this show and hope it continues.Only those who want it to be a replica of the original series will be disappointed.",9
North America,"As Wednesday Addams begins at her new school Nevermore, she finds herself attempting to thwart a series of monstrous killings all while attempting to navigate her new relationships at school.When I heard that Tim Burton would be directing and producing an Addams family spinoff starring the phenomenal Jenna Ortega as Wednesday Addams I nearly fell out of my chair. It immediately became one of my most anticipated shows of the year and after finishing it did not disappoint.Jenna Ortega has possibly the most potential amongst the younger actors and actresses working today and to see her in what looks like the role she was born to play is truly incredible. Every scene she is in is phenomenal, and her ability to take over a scene with showing basically no emotion and focusing on acting with her eyes and body is phenomenal.Burton is known for his dark, gothic style of directing and it shows in this first season. Every scene involving Wednesday is given a feel unlike the rest. Even if they are in a place such as a coffee shop or a classroom if Wednesday is present Burton adds a gothic style that is perfectly well done.The plot itself is a well written mystery. It keeps you guessing throughout the season as clues are discovered and killings continue. My only real issue with the script is the the writing for some of the side characters. I found that anyone under the age of 18 who is not named Wednesday were not super well done. When the story shifted towards a character for the purpose of a subplot rather than using them within the solving of the mystery I found that I was less interested. That being said if they were used in the context of the mystery I didn't mind their character and thought it worked well. Enid on the other hand is an exception to that, I thought she really worked as a counterpart to Wednesday and I felt her subplot was well handled. It was characters like Bianca, Tyler and Xavier that I felt could have been handled better. The older side characters on the other hand I really enjoyed. Gwendoline Christie as Larissa Weems is amazing, there is one scene in particular where her and Wednesday are in her office and she gets a little agitated and leans towards Wednesday it gave me goosebumps.The final thing I will touch on is the use of the entire Addams family. I won't go into into spoilers so I'll make the blanket statement of I liked the castings and I liked how they were used.Overall Wednesday is everything I wanted it to be, a great showcase of Tim Burtons style using a childhood classic piece of fiction all while Jenna Ortega gives what may be her best performance to date in a well written murder mystery.8.5/10

North America,"But I just can't with Netflix « vision ». And I hope the show was written according to Jenna Ortega as the lead. And not JUST to have her in it. I don't know if she's the only gifted young actress these days, or if being a Latina gives her an advantage in the industry. But she kind of works as this rereading of the Wednesday character. That being said, I really don't get why they picked an actor who could play Fester, as Gomez. But I guess it was also Netflix way of « rebranding » the franchise. Nothing bad to say about Zeta-Jones, though. She's perfect and gorgeous as Morticia Addams. And the little bro, is just too irrelevant to care. Now, I won't lie. The premise sounds a awful lot like all of the platform's teen fantasy series. And as entertaining as this one can be, it lacks originality. And is surprisingly tame coming from the anything but commonly Tim Burton. Maybe he just signed his name, and left it to other people to develop the concept. Which would explain a lot. But I can't honestly suggest this to people who loved the movies. Or warn them to not expect to find any ressemblance with it.",1
North America,"A centrist view of the Addams family designed to not offend and to average out competing expectations.Plot was a bit slow and weak as well as unnecessarily
convoluted. Luis great as Gomez, Morticia not so much, but who can touch Ms. Huston's portrayal anyway. Unfortunately the main acting problem is actually Wednesday herself. I think the script and or the direction made her too strident, not enough of the fantastic dead pan we saw with Ms. Rici.. Also Wednesday's interest were never so conventional, and teen angsty. Trying to appeal to the widest possible audience I suppose under the guise of well she is older now? I don't know. Just not a good switch from her esoteric almost random interest and penchants to a laser focused Nancy drew. Doesn't fit character or the Addams in general.Let the haters begin, this is just my opinion and I am still glad to have seen it and recommend it. Just don't think it is all that and that it could have been made much better with out too much being done differently.I respect other point of view.",7
North America,"I sat through this because my wife wanted to watch it.It's not the worst but it's very drawn out.It's Harry Potter meets the Worst Witch meets Sleepy Hollow meets Colombo.I won't go into too much detail but my wife and i cracked the case by episode four out of eight.There are the usual twists that are either predictable or convenient and since Cristina Ricci is in it, it was unfortunately predictable what her character became.The final 'Boss Fight' with the pilgrim guy was rubbish and the character was fairly laughable and somewhat of a contradiction as to his motives and abilities.Also, leaving the show the way they did in final scene wasn't necessary, leaving it so open to another series.Even Tim Burton stopped caring and didn't direct all of the episodes.If you want a new angle on the Addams Family then by all means give it a watch but you won't be missing much if you don't.",6
North America,"Other than using the Addams family name and a few characters from the original show - this series is absolutely nothing to do with Addams family. It's absolutely awful, such a childish teenage show that's so obvious at every turn. How this show is getting the praise it's getting is beyond me. The monsters look ridiculous! The stories are laughable. The only thing that's actually good in this show is Jenna ortega as Wednesday but even shes not enough to save it. Such a pathetic attempt to use an old name and turn it into something new. It's basically the same as every other teenage show Netflix creates and what makes it worse is the fact Tim Burton had anything to do with this abysmal series.If you enjoy this show and you're over the age 18, please ask yourself why?It's terrible. Typical teenage bullS##T.",2
North America,"My family really likes how the creators are making his show their own and not sticking with the traditional Adam's Family. Jenna Ortega is an excellent Wednesday! Awesome special effects too with how they created Thing with it's personality and relationship with Wednesday. It's really cute and unique. Unfortunately, though we are not fond of the actor that plays Gomez. He seems to be trying to act to hard to fit the character, but it just feels off. The chemistry at the start of the show with him and Jones really seems uncomfortable. Like every show there are up's and down's, but this one is still excellent. We hope Netflix can take this show further with several seasons.",8
North America,"The script was just abysmal, making mediocre performances even more mediocre. Wednesdays character had promise but poor execution.I know it's hard to act bad characters and the writing left so much to be desired, but the performances felt like they'd be more comfortable on Nickelodeon than a series designed to be dark and uncomfortable.It was unclear where Wednesdays line of creepiness was, and the idea of the men following her round with their tongues lolling out was reminiscent of a fanfiction written circa 2007, uninspired and unbelievable.Premise of never more also confusing regarding whether it was meant to be a known or unknown secret. Had to stop watching I couldn't bear the cringe.",1
North America,"Perfectly morbid, superb acting throughout and smooth! I enjoy anything with Jenna Ortega is quite talented and she's great as Wednesday based on Adam's Family. Tim Burton is masterful at weird/intriguing characters that are excellent to watch. The bulk of the time I use other services, this is a perfect reason to use Netflix. I love that this is focused on young folks, anything bizarre and beautiful 4K quality colors. Quite surprise form Tim Burton a lot of his projects didn't have much horror, mostly Sci-Fi, adventure, and drama. Wednesday is a pleasant surprise after all the promotions I've seen I highly recommend it!",10
North America,"The Addams Family was FUN, this show is not fun - far from being a fun comedy.Misandry. Definition: dislike of, contempt for, ingrained prejudice, or hatred against men. Is this all that Netflix knows how to produce these days? Gomez is a fun and romantic man but here he is just creepy - all men are weird and creepy in a bad way while the females are weird in a good way.Wednesday is not the lovable Wednesday Addams that we know and love but a dark angry girl. The core of the plot is the empowerment of a condescending anti-social aloof angry toxic teen female with an attitude of superiority over everyone else - bravo. Wednesday does not provide any sort of a positive role model for young girls.The writers today do not know how to create, only to destroy.Shameful Netflix, shameful.BTW - what is the anti-Pilgrim discrimination?Anti-religion propaganda?",4
North America,"So the Acting is alright for most and great for the main characters. The Tim Burton vibe is rocking it! The teen highschool drama predictability is breaking it slightly! They should tone down that part.Now this does still make it remain a 9,4. Tim Burton, the main characters, sound effects and visual effects are just that good!Hopefully they turn down the typical teenage highschooldrama for the next season. This series does not need that cringe to fill the series. They should have the main storyline in the hands of Burton but maybe this is the place to experiment with the teenage highschool drama theme. Not changing the two main characters though that story does just work.",9
North America,"""Wednesday"" - is the reincarnation of the ""The Addams Family"" created in 1938 by artist Charles Addams. For the first time, his creation was published in the form of a comic book and was published in The New Yorker magazine. Screen versions appeared on the big screen in various forms: films, series and animation.""Wednesday""Tim Burton, known for his love of the gothic style, is behind the latest adaptation of the life of the Addams family. He called the young talent Jenna Ortega for the lead role, and also made the cast recognizable with the help of Gwyndolyn Christie (Game of Thrones) and Christine Ricci (who played Wednesday Addams in The Addams Family in 1991).PlotWednesday Addams is expelled from another school for ordinary people. Wednesday's parents find the only solution to this problem and send her to a school for outcasts (a school for people gifted with unusual abilities: werewolves, nagas, vampires, etc.). According to Addams, this school will not teach her anything, and she is going to run away. But on a fateful night, she becomes involved in a mysterious story that she intends to unleash.The relationship of the characters fuels interest in the plot. History is full of betrayals, distrust and secrets. To unravel the mysterious tangle, Wednesday will have to go against her principles, which distinguish her from all the outcasts.ConclusionWednesday isn't just a mind-growing teen show. Everyone who looks will find lessons for himself that will be useful to him in life. Also, the picture is seasoned with black humor, which will appeal to many and excellent soundtrack.",8
North America,"Spooky, funny, and entertaining. Jenna Ortaga as the Adams family character Wednesday was fantastic. She was smart, stoic, and an absolute gem. The mystery she eventually solved almost killed her but she still managed to catch the culprits and save the day. Just like in Scream the killers were somebody she knew. Jenna has already became one of my top favorite scream queens, along side Neve Campbell,( my absolute favorite) and Jamie Lee Curtis from Halloween. My hope is that Jenna gets another season with this show because I think more creatures could be told and also because it's a masterpiece.",10
North America,"I love this serie, (hope for more) the Wednesday interpretation by Jenna Ortega is expectacular and the side characters are great. The Addams are one of my favorite of all time and Tim Burton directing is a need to see!!!!The story is about Wednesday adventures, a book story to be published. The ""friends"" Wednesday have and the past stories she discover were great. Some mystery to solve and some lives to save.Nevermore Academy is a good theme for monsters and outcast to ensure more chapters in this series.I really recommend this series and enjoy watching it. With only 8 chapters is a great weekend view.",10
North America,Just watched WEDNESDAY for the THIRD time. It really was a fun adventure and the beautiful friendship between Enid and Wednesday made me cry like a baby. I loved every episode but the finale was superior. Tim Burton didn't disappoint he never does. Gwendoline Christie is one hell of a woman she is a Goddess. I really loved her in this.DANNY ELFMAN! I love him I listen to Batman Returns soundtrack weekly.I also love the Easter eggs to past Burton projects.I'm a Halloween baby that was always called Wednesday because my black braids. I still wear them to this day watching Wednesday. Loved this!!I know let's make another season!!!,10
North America,"Wow, what a wonderful adaptation from the original movies.This series strikes a wonderful balance between the dark gritty feel of the Netflix Sabrina series, and the world of wonder, colour and delight from the first Harry Potter movie.All the actors do really well in bringing their characters to life. Needless to say, Jenna Ortega brought her A game and did an amazing job.Took a bit of time to get used to the way they depicted Wednesdays parents. I know they're based on the original comic but I was expecting to see the flamboyant Gomaz and expressionless like Morticia Adams. But I must say that the quirky warmth plays well to Catherine Zeta-Jones. She did a good job portraying the loving but complicated relationship between a mother and a teen.Luis Guzmans' portrayal of Gomez was good as well, the character grew on me especially after I watched the series for a 2nd time (it's that good).The only thing I feel could've been done better was the Hyde monster.I hope the series comes out with a second season, and they keep it true to this first season, slightly bright and maintaining the development of All the characters and storylines.",10
North America,"I'm new to writing reviews, so bear with me.... Tim burton at his best! This was non stop intrigue from start to finish! Jenny Ortega is the perfect embodiment of a more mature Wednesday. Loved Christina Richie, always have. So glad she was a part of this project. For those of you like me, who are not always a fan of straight horror, give it a try. It's horror drama with beautiful splashes of dark comedy, and the nods to other adaptations makes you nostalgic. It's a sweet mix of Stranger Things and Harry Potter shown through the macabre eyes of Tim Burton. My only complaint was to see Gwendoline Christie's character leave so soon. It was great to see her again after Game Of Thrones. She's statuesque and a beautiful actress. I binged the entire first season in one day, and I guarantee you will too! Can't wait for the next season!!!",10
North America,"The fact that Tim Burton was not the director of the two films from the 90s' is quite surprising. I'm amazed it took this long for him to do any sort of adaptation to the Addams Family.The premise is very simple. Wednesday is sent to an outcast school, Nevermore, and attempts to solve a series of murders by a monster within the school.For those looking for a project that reflects some of Burton's early work, this is it and it is the perfect style for this type of show. I love the set designs and the cinematography is tremendous for a show like this.This is a show that is really driven by its cast. Jenna Ortega is wonderful as Wednesday, giving a very hilarious deadpan performance. Catherine Zeta-Jones is a surprisingly perfect Morticia. Luis Guzman is an odd yet humorous choice for Gomez. However, my favorite performance, outside of Ortega's, is Gwendoline Christie as the Principal Larissa. She so delightfully creepy, that she fits this show like a glove.There are only a couple of minor problems with the show thus far. For one, some of the shows scenes with the teenage characters can come off as rather formulaic. Also, one of the highlights of the original source material and the two films from the 90s' was that the rest of the world contrasted the Addams family completely. The real world in this show is very much Tim Burtons version of it, which sometimes doesn't differentiate itself enough from them.So overall, a great show that really brings Tim Burton back to his roots as a filmmaker. If you are a fan of Burton or just the Addams Family in general, you will love this.",8
North America,"I thought Wednesday was amazing, I just can't get enough. I grew up loving the show, animated series and the movies so I was surprised to see quite a few people complaining but I noticed one thing in common; they want the same old 9 year old wednesday when she's 15 now so of course it's going to be a little different. But it still has the Addams Family vibe and she's still Wednesday Addams.Overall, it's my favourite show this year. It has mystery, suspense and a plot twist at the end. Go into it with an open mind and I guarantee you'll love it. Also holy crap I did not recognize Christina Ricci at all!",10
North America,"I loved it!!Jenna Ortega did a spectacular job, the story is awesome, the Addams' family vibes are exactly the way we know! Wednesday's dance was something that we didn't imagine we needed hehe. Thing is on point too! The whole suspense about it getting attacked really got me worried, uncle Faster appearing was an amazing surprise and it was in a special moment, seeing Wednesday so vulnerable with him because of Thing was very special and important. She's such a great character, Jenna definitely slayed!! The romantic scene about watching a terror movie was also splendid, her personality is super well written.",10
North America,"Its really complicated, the ending was a Disney ending as you know it, but the rest of it up until then was fantastic in my opinion. Wednesday is becoming more and more outgoing, making good friends with the others but staying very true to herself which is good. Shes also getting less pale than she was before, whether that just came across to me or was just like that to show that she had changed in the face of feelings etc. Put aside. The episode was really good the ending left you wondering why they released the villain why didnt he kill anyone with the staff so nobody was ever really hurt and the headmistress was just killed straight away even though she had great potential and could certainly fight, the potential was not used which is tragic. But you can still leave the ending as it is, Im looking forward to the next season and I hope that mistakes like those made by the headmistress or in the final fight dont happen again, otherwise the series was really good.",9
North America,"The expected hauntingly macabre humour and the dark mischievous wit is no where to be seen. It's too tamed, too soft, too dull and too blandly predictable to be enjoyable. The show has sucked out every bit of morbid sense and left it with a generic vanilla teen murder mystery show. Emo girl wannabe detective with her unknown powers and her trusted preppy side-kick, trying to solve a + something years old mystery and you guessed it - a Prophecy involving her, dun, dun, duuuun....Honestly it's like Veronica Mars meets Scooby Doo meets Monster high, set in a dupe Hogwarts. I suppose I should be thankful that they didn't make her an orphan to the boot.Honestly hard-core Addams fans know that the paranormal and supernatural is something that was supposed to be uniquely Addams. Their whole charm was that they were the oddballs in a normal world. Wednesday being in a society of likes makes it less whimsical and more bland.To think that I had such high expectations for something that turned out to be nothing but a lackluster G-rated teen fantasy.This show could have had soo much potential and yet it was squandered away by its too many non-Addams characters. Not even Jenna Ortega, who was doing an admirable job as Wednesday can save this show. Tim Burton has lost his touch.",1
North America,This show is absolutely perfection in every way possible but I have to reduce 0.5 score because of the terrible CGI monster it looks so bad it literally looks like they reused the head from Snake Beetlejuice hopefully next season will have a bigger Budget because the major secession already of Wednesday I've already re watched it 2 times personally. I don't know whose idea it was the cast Jenna Ortega as Wednesday but I applaud you and not to mention the villain is played by the original Wednesday from the movie. I love this series so much and I'm just waiting for season 2 it better come because I might throw hands.,9
North America,"Binge watched it in a day and already want to watch it again. The whole cast was amazing! Jenna Ortega killed it (pun intended) as Wednesday! Every episode kept my interested and there was never a dull or boring moment. I wish I wouldn't have watched it so fast, but after each episode I couldn't stop myself from starting the next one. It looked good in the trailers but I didn't have high hopes because Jenna Ortega had big shoes to fill. It definitely blew me away and went beyond exceeding my expectations. Kudos to the cast and crew on their amazing work! It kept me guessing and on my toes. I'm hoping there's a season 2!",10
North America,"Tim Burton's sense of the dark and Ms Ortega's surgical skill in deadpan delivery make this an explosion of smart, fun escapism. It is as effective at creating an alternate/undiscovered reality as the Harry Potter series.Cliches approach, and then are dashed. Lots of stereotypical characters are introduced, then the cover is opened to reveal the book inside. So aside from all the deliciously morose humor, the mysterious monster, and tension between the townies and cutters (ref: Breaking Away), is the wonderful and sometimes painful interaction of the students as they themselves grow and sometimes grow together. Aside from the ones that die.",9
North America,"You'll like this if you liked ""Chilling Adventures of Sabrina"", ""Riverdale"", and other cookie-cutter CW supernatural teen dramas. I'm not personally a fan of those shows, but I have seen them and can confirm that the plot of Wednesday is simply a reorganized retelling of plot-lines from those shows.Although I didn't like the show, I know not everything is meant to appeal to everyone and so I'd rather give a mostly optimistic review for my negative experience. Some of the few ways this show exceeds those other teen dramas, is the show knowing it's simplicity, the devotion to the autumn aesthetic, some songs that are overplayed in mainstream movies but they're still good songs, and giving us a slightly different protagonist even if it's a very basic Gothic ""weird girl"" type. I can't make this review without talking about the writing, and I simply can't sugar-coat how awful the writing is. It felt like the writers intentionally inserted cliche phrases, barely researched concepts, and googled ""uncommon words"" to over-complicate very basic terms which just stood out. They put all of that into the script like a madlibs game, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and excuse it as a maybe rushed project. With how horrible the writing was, I'd like to focus the attention on how Jenna carries the bad dialogue and softens the blow making it seem not so bad with some of her delivery. She does her best to make up for the incompetent writers who did a horrible job, but she in her role, couldn't fix their short-comings. The bad writing is more apparent in the side characters who truly feel like extras due to how little character they have. Even the love interest has the personality of a plank of wood so when the forced relationship happens, the protagonist just increasingly looks dumb. There's so much more I can rant about, but I feel like I got my main conspicuous complaints off my chest.",4
North America,"Great watch, full of twists and turns. High level of unpredictability and keeps you entertained. It's dark yet light hearted with comical moments. The perfect balance of mystery, drama, dark, fantasy and comedy.Great acting by Jenny Ortega, her character is intriguing and quirky. They nailed it with this spin off and have revived the Addams family for these modern times. Caterina Zeta Jones plays Morticia and Christina Ricci plays Thornhill's character. Great cast & plot.You could binge watch it in a day or two, super awesome. I hope they make a few more seasons. I Look forward to season 2.",10
North America,"... I would have skipped this after E4 (the one with the extremely cheesy highschool dance)... The series has much promise, but dabbles WAY too much in teeny soap. Jenna kept me watching, she's got a ton of charisma in this role... BUT: then they take away all that by evolving her character from everything that makes her interesting to just another girl infatuated with the handsome artsy guy... who then hands her an Iphone for saving his life... that's bad on so many levels... This series could have set a counterpoint to mainstream, instead the protagonist falls in line. If there's a second season and it picks up where this one left us, I'm out...",6
North America,All I honestly have to say is that who they chose to play Gomez is terrible. Where's cancel culture when you need it? He doesn't fit the bill at all. Out of all the Hispanic actors they could have use they chose a 3rd rate actor? What happen to a Gomez that's accurate to what he's supposed to look like? I feel as if everyone else was a great casting choice. The choise of Wednesday was 100% perfect. The casting for Morticia of that's how you spell her name was also great. Heck Pugsley was even incredibly casted. Lurch is possibly my favorite character casting in the show. He is 100% casted. What does everyone else think ?,8
North America,"I thought this was a really fun, and interesting take on Wednesday Addams. It has much the same feel as teen dramas like Riverdale and Sabrina (which I enjoyed), but without the sex, cursing, and never ending meanness that pervades those. The acting is great, and the writing is high quality. There are a bunch of twists, so although you may guess the ending, you can still enjoy the ride.My husband complained that she was not as biting as in the Addams Family movies, but I think that's a good thing, it would be hard to maintain that level for eight episodes centered entirely on her. .You follow Wednesday as she tries to solve a series of murders at her parents' alma matter, which is now her boarding school as well.Tim Burton maintained the humorous tone the Addams Family is known for. It has a lot of funny or lighthearted moments without being slapstick.",8
North America,"I started watching this show with anticipation having seen the trailers before it's release on the streaming platform. I loved the classic tv series and the previous films with Raul Julia. But the more episodes I watch of this new Tim Burton produced series, the less interest I had in continuing. The production quality is good and expected given Tim Burton is directing it. But there is just something off about the tv series that make it so different from the previous Addam family shows. I didn't care for the X-Men like school of odd balls or the ScubbyDoo Mystery at the heart of the film. This show just had too much of a Disney vibe to it, especially with the casting. Yeah, this wasn't for me but perhaps it will appeal to the newer generation who grew up with the X-men, Umbrella Company comic book films. Sad, because I thought the first episode was good. I like what Wednesday character did at the pool, that was funny. But the mystery behind the Hyde monster, not so much.",4
North America,Jenna Ortega is a star. Depthful acting for a challengingly one dimensional role. The supporting cast is excellent. I was truly surprised to be charmed by the whole thing. Jenna also manages to be quite alluring as Wednesday.I don't know if this is a second season show or where it will go if it does but it is a truly satisfying series in one season. We have done the family so I suppose it being Netflix a second season is inevitable.I had seen and not really noticed Jenna in the Scream reboot/omage. She was good and cute and strong but I didn't really see her until Wednesday. I think Charles Addams would approve.,10
North America,"Grotesquely engaging and darkly funny. The timing and dry comedic writing is cleverly superb. It's like Hogwarts meets Xavier's school for mutants meets Adams Family with a sprinkle of Twilight.Just plain fun all the way around. Excellent job of casting Jenna, Catherine was good as well, but honestly Luis Guzman should have been someone else. I guess Banderas or Javier Bardem wasn't available? Sigh.The story does get a bit confusing as they add more and more backstory to the storyline, but at that point just watch the pretty pictures!It's believable and will keep you binge watching for at least a few hours if not days.",10
North America,Well....this was just amazing from start to finish. I normally pride myself on being able to guess the killer quite early on but this had me guessing and re guessing all the way through. Fabulously written and even more fabulously acted...particularly well done to Jenna Ortega who is by far the most talented young actress out there at the moment.Jenna played the most incredible and believable Wednesday Addams so far.Move over Harry Potter...there's a new magical and mysterious world that everyone will want to be a part of.This HAS to have another season and then another and another...please.,10
North America,"Everything about it is done perfectly, the entire cast, crew, set (I read on here that it was filmed in Romania, wicked cool) everything about this was just perfect; the black cello, the macabre, the monsters, the murder mystery, the dedication of the fountain with Wednesday playing cello, snap twice, Thing, costumes, the half and half glass window, the cello solo in the first episode, I know that I mentioned cello thrice but it was Awesome. I am gonna get that song she plays outside her room for my ipod. Thank you all for doing such a wonderful job with this show, whomever was involved, it is perfect.",10
North America,"Such a good serie, really captivating. Watched the entire season in one night. And CAN'T wait for season two, if there's even one... But it has to be, right?Love her very own dark character, on the other hand wished she was maybe a little more dark and murderous but in her own ways? Those of you who have seen the series understand.Recommend this serie to everyone, can also be seen as a child as it is not too scary and bloody. My little sister aged 7 and my mum aged 48 loved it as much as I did aged 22.Will probably have time to watch it one or two more times before season two is released, and I will!However, they need to make the monsters better, the monster (without too much of a spoiler) looked terribly cartoonish. That is the only thing that drags down the ratings and, the end (those of you who know, you know) that person looked ridiculous and not scary at all.",10
North America,"A lot of twists but not all that complex, just shifting the uncertainty around and never any doubt that the ""good"" guys would win in the end. Jenna Ortega is brilliant as Wednesday Adams. Easy and breezy and visually stunning with a Tim Burton twist. Better than most shows I've watched on Netty-flix. I hope there's a season 2 with a bit more darkness and bite.It's funny that the show seems to borrow from legally blond, a girl out of place in a new school, smart but in unfamiliar surroundings. It borrows from a few high-school tropes, which sounds kind of cheesy, but Jenna and Tim Burton make it work.I still think the show is missing something. When it's all over, it feels like it was more of a flashy appetizer than a meal, but still very good. Solid 9 stars.",9
North America,"Loved the show. Didn't care much for Uncle Fester as he seemed like an unnecessary distraction. There were a few moments where her attitude felt tedious but overall, a perfect rendition of the wit, ability and fearlessness of the Wednesday Addams character. Jenna Ortega did a masterful job as the stoic young woman where slight nuances of facial expression were subtle but expressive moments of character development. I enjoyed all the performances and the story line was engaging enough. I remember watching the original Addams Family TV show and this in depth story on Wednesday was a worthy rendition of those characters and a lot of fun to watch.",8
North America,For the life of me I cannot figure out the absolute terrible takes that the rotten tomatoes website has on actually good TV shows and movies. They literally called this a CW show with Wednesday Addams. I was shocked because I'll be honest this is probably the best experience I've had watching a show on Netflix since the first season of stranger things. Not only is it one of the best shows I've seen this year but it's probably one of the best things that Tim Burton has done in a very long time. Jenna Ortega is the best part of the show but all the other characters are extremely likable as well and nobody is perfect. Which is also the thing that I like the most is that everybody in the show is flawed. It's not super over the top cartoony dark like some of the movies are but it takes a little bit more of a realistic approach with the Addams family personalities and relationships. The Burton monster elements are still there though and they are awesome to watch. If you look at it more through the angle of Wednesday trying to find empathy and a reason to care about the people around her you get a lot more out of it. So for me personally I really don't understand why snobby critics just accuse us of being a cheesy teen drama with a consensus that you would see on CW... because it has a lot more to say than those types of shows and it's also very smart in the approach that they have with the Addams family and their relationship with each other and the people in the town that this takes place in. Please give this a watch this is a good show!,9
North America,"Let's start saying that this series, finally, pushed me back to the ""binge watching"" feelings.Lately, nothing caught me up like this.Well written, the characters are perfect and (forgive me), Wednesday is lovely!(Inid too)But:It was advertised as a ""Tim Burton' series"".. at least he directed 3/4 episodes.. for the rest, just an executive producer. (Better like this.. I don't like the late Burton's style)Truth is that is a Millar&Gough's creation!Great soundtrack selection!!!(Just to mention..... Apocalyptica..)
Elfman's theme is greatAnd it's a very good creation!!!WATCH IT!!",9
North America,"I really wish they would make a movie or series involving the Addams, that was just the good ol' dark satire and humor, but without trying to make a political statement!This series at it's core is basically kind of a fun whodunnit! With little tidbits of humor thrown in once in a while.The acting was really good as you would expect from a Burton directed show. And the cinematography was really good also. With lots of beautiful New Englandish fall colors.Netflix did a really, incredibly exceptional job with the Enola Holmes movies. Wednesday is kind of along the same lines, but not nearly as much fun. And the added political and social commentary took away my enthusiasm for show. I wound up not really caring who dunnit and just wanted the last couple episodes to just end.",6
North America,"The acting, soundtrack, imagery, dialogue, and characters are what you'd expect from a Tim Burton production. It's comforting, yet somehow strange, that Tim's style and tone are still consistent so many decades later. If you have enjoyed any of his work in the past 2-3 decades, you'll thoroughly enjoy this show, even if you must ignore the plot holes and repetitive storytelling techniques.There aren't a lot of negatives I have to say about this show, but it feels obvious that Tim doesn't know how to do a TV show. The writing becomes thin as it drags and tries desperately to find cliffhangers and stretch the story to the next episode. The number of times someone goes in and out of the local jail and is almost expelled but then forgiven, or something ""terrible"" may or may not happen to whatever character gets ridiculous in the last few episodes.I hope Tim continues to the second season and figures out how to write several unique episodes that organically tie together. Unfortunately, each episode just started feeling repetitive; the only thing keeping me engaged were the characters and their various arcs.Beyond that, as many have already said, Jenna Ortega is Wednesday, Addams. It's also nice to see other Addams family members pop in and out of the show. It would be nice to have at least one episode in the Addams family house.I look forward to a second season, ideally with a better story and plot.",7
North America,"Didn't really like it but I wonder beside brand name why use Wednesday Addams?It would work much better as a new character, because this is not Wednesday or the Addams family for that matter, at the heart the Addams were always about familiy and while they had a weird lifestyle they were all good at heart, Wednesday is cruel not only strangers but also her parents and even Thing one of best friends.Of course Wednesday is not a real person so she varies from adaptation to adaptation, but she is just really unpleasant and boring, using a lot of time for some forced drama of what she is not, its just boring.",3
North America,"I think this is my first review on here. But, I'm going to keep this quick and simple like the title. Watch this - for a clever intertwined story. It's been forever since I've watched something so well written.Read beyond this for spoilers:
Although, avid film and Tim Burton fans may pick up or make some educated guesses. The way the story is written and woven together is beautiful. The way it keeps shifting and revisiting little snippets is fantastic.The only bad part is when Crackstone comes back and legit looks like ""The Leprechaun"" haha. I personally loved it and found it funny, but it was in necessary. If he had a spell bound he could have looked normal or like anything, but they chose the make him a 6ft version of the. Leprechaun hahaha.",10
North America,"Was expecting just an Ooky, Kooky kind of show in the Addams Family tradition. But I started watching it, and ended up binge watching the entire season. Jenna Ortega absolutely embodies Wednesday, she was amazing in the role.The whole story line was very interesting, and, in most parts, flowed well. It lags in a few spots with some of the tertiary characters stories, but that's a minor complaint.The only thing that grinded on my nerves was the casting of Luiz Guzman as Gomez...he didn't fit the role at all. Not meant to be a shot at him as an actor, just not for this role. Though his role in the series is minimal, it took me out of the story whenever he appeared. Fred Armisen.as Uncle Fester makes up for it...he was hilarious.If you're looking for fun and entertaining show to watch, I highly recommend this one.Jenna has my vote for an Emmy on this one.",8
North America,"WOOW WOW WOOW! To any fan of this story, the original, believe me when I say you won't be disappointed at all. Tim Burton, Jenna Ortega, Christina Ricci and the whole cast & crew did an amazing work! I won't deny it, I was originally worried the original essence of the story would be lost 'cause recently a lot of revivals are not delivering what you originally know of them; and WOW! I've known the story since I was little, and I loved every single minute of this series. You can still feel the original essence of it with the perfect modern twist as if they, the Addams family, where truly alive.",10
North America,"My only review is I am loving it. I love mysteries, and this was not at all what I was expecting. Jenna Ortega is so good, her ability to act without any emotions is awesome. She portrays Wednesday so well. I hope there is another season. I can tell Tim Burtons imagination was greatly involved. It was perfect for Christina Ricci to be in this, what better then the best Wednesday to be in this. It is a typical high school kids environment but with a twist of supernatural, monsters, comedy and mystery. I don't know what took them so long to make this. Unfortunately, only Wednesday was cast well.",10
North America,"A real gem of a show but I am afraid to like it too much given the tendency for Netflix to cancel original content after one season or, almost as bad, taking YEARS to come out with another season.In short, this is better than anything ""Addams family"" that I have ever enjoyed. It sort of reminds me of Harry Potter but with a much lighter story. It's quirky and funny and just generally a blast. I can definitely see kids dressing up as Wednesday Addams for Halloween this year. The quiet little girl of the original television series has been fully developed into the best part of the family. I'm not too keen on Gomez Addams but the rest of the gang is awesome! Watch it and you won't look back.",9
North America,"This adaptation relies almost entirely on the nostalgia of the Addams family.Firstly we are expected to believe this is a school for outcasts but you'd be forgiven for forgetting this as we rarely ever see why the students are outcasts/gifted. The contrived way ""Woe"" was included in every title with clumsy puns was embarrassing and unnecessary, this isn't Friends.Obviously Wednesday is portrayed as a continuation of her original character - a cold stoned hard ass- but none of her actions are worthy of this portrayal, she is consistently being saved by everyone else; Edin, Golly, Eugene, Bianca, literally everyone and she still has the gall to say lines like 'this isn't going to end well for you' microseconds before certain death if it hadn't been for all her saviours. I loved Harry Potter but this was my main gripe with Harry and his almost exclusive use of the expelliarmus charm BUT at least he never pretended to be a cold stoned hard ass.Then there's all the build up of the plot only for the main villain to be easily defeated, despite his superior strength and powers, thus having a minuscule amount of screen time, without any significant death, destruction or consequences. She even needed major help to eventually discovery who Laurel really was, she had no idea who Laurel was before Eugene mentioned the red shoes (after already incorrectly accusing the psychiatrist and Xavier), what if he hadn't have woken up or woke up after she got on the train (oh yeah the Hyde would have intercepted and killed her). There were at times comical moments but few and far in between and they eventually became predictable and clichéd.Usually a big fan but woefully disappointed in Tim Burton with this adaptation, he probably should have retired a while ago with his legacy intact. People have watch this due to the original Addams connection but this will be quickly forgotten, if they release season 2 (of course they will, they always bleed cash cows dry- the end?) it will take a noise dive in ratings as it won't be as nostalgic and the storyline is dead. Some of the acting was good, writing was ok.",4
North America,"I was excited about Ortega playing this role. She'll do it well. Zeta-Jones is perfect for the role as well. Guzman is the worst possible choice for the role of Gomez. Gomez Addams was never a repulsively ugly and creepy character. The original Gomez may not have been insanely handsome, but he wasn't repulsive. He was debonair, suave and still good looking. He didn't make you cringe when he obsessively fawned over Morticia. This actor is just slimy, creepy and repulsive for this role.As far as Pugsley goes, I have nothing against the actor. He seems fine. What I have an issue with is the writing of his character being emotional and weak. Pugsley was never a crybaby. I fully expect this to be dark and twisted (after all, it IS Burton and that IS what the public craves) so it should be well done. I just can't bring myself to keep watching Guzman in this role.",3
North America,"There's absolutely nothing new Wednesday adds to the genre. It's the same cliche story you've heard a thousand times already. A coming-of-age story of a teenage girl that turns into a Nancy Drew murder mystery. Seriously, how many times has this been done at this point? Not only is the entire plot a copy and paste from the last ten stories that have done it, the writers couldn't have even bothered to put any decent twists into the story. I'm not going to explicitly state any spoilers in this review, but you should be able to solve the mystery on your own before you get to the final episode. It's a 4/10 because the only unique thing about the show is that this time they decided to cash in on the Addams family, which is a franchise that needed more love, but it definitely deserved better than this Navy Drew, Harry Potter knock-off.",4
North America,"We can all walk into this knowing it will never compare to the movies from the early 90s, so let's get that out of the way.Wednesday is a writer, a fencer, a cellist, a ninja, and a seer. Sounds kind of badass, but she's more b*** than badass. She doesn't have any likable traits, at all. They've tried to recreate everything about what made Ricci's portrayal of Wednesday so iconic, and overdo it to an extreme that made her so unlikable.Also, The casting for this show is really subpar as most of the actors included have mediocre talent, at best.They've managed to make all characters, especially the MAIN character so unlikable, it's not even worth going past the first episode.",1
North America,"What Chilling Adventures of Sabrina COULD'VE BEEN. (i'm joking obviously)It's like Tim Burton watched Chilling Adventures of Sabrina (Part 1, the only part of that show that's worth watching) and said to himself ""I can do A LOT BETTER!"" And he SUCCESSFULLY did.The similarities are as follows: Pilgrims. Witches. And pilgrim witches. A look into a strange past involving pilgrims burning witches. Visions. Visits from spirits. Ghosts. A boarding school in the woods for supernatural students. Outside a small town that is mostly toxically patriarchal, filled with small-minded town folk who just want to appear accepting in a shallow way, while covering up/just forgetting their history with teenage boys being bullies and causing problems. A strange and mysterious destiny that seems inescapable to the female protagonist who believes they are evil or might become evil in the near future. The female protagonist has a very supportive family. The female protagonist has a complicated relationship with their mother (or mother-figure). The female protagonist has a teacher that is even more supportive, telling her whatever she wants to hear in an obviously grooming her kind-of-way. The female protagonist rejects ""normal"" and has no real interest in s*x/physical relations in the way her family has taught her. The female protagonist likes to do things and handle problems ALONE, but will put her friends/loved ones in mortal danger. Takes her loved ones/friends for granted a bit. She likes to challenge authority. Witch hunters. A love interest that is a normal boy who helps her although he doesn't know much about the supernatural, what she's planning and is also somewhat afraid/spooked of the supernatural with a dead mother and strained relationship with his father, and for whatever reason seems to be interested in the female protagonist. A semi-love triangle with normal boy (who wears a lot of plaid) and a boy who's not normal, immediately interested in the female protagonist, popular, strange and suspicious. A mean girl who has a history with the supernatural love interest, is in choir and whom becomes an ally. A best friend to the protagonist who has her own struggles but is mostly positive and is also supernatural. In the end something supernatural happens that makes the protagonist ""fall out of love""/walk away from the plaid-wearing love interest and returns to strange and suspicious love interest who is ""more her kind"". Oh, and a brother (or brother-figure) that the female protagonist is close to. And a sidekick who will help her with whatever, especially spying, and is not human.End of joke.LOVED this show. I was surprised to see that Morticia Addams was a little less darker than I'm used to, and also she doesn't speak French. And the whole family is Latino (?) I think.The whole cast is very talented. I do hope that this isn't one more show that Netflix goes ""oh the cast isn't completely/mostly white? Well we can replace that with something else, we're sure it won't be missed."" THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE SHOWS LIKE THIS ONE. For the sake of the baby goths of the future generations (joke) but no seriously, I really hope there will be a season 2.The only real flaw was that it wasn't longer (felt a bit rushed near the end), but Netflix rarely gives more than 8 episodes to something with a big budget like this one. I CAN ONLY HOPE THAT SEASON 2 WILL BE PICKED UP QUICKLY, and maybe contains more than 8 episodes this time.I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT.",8
North America,"I'm giving it a 10/10. Sure some things were predictable, but you can't deny this series was seriously good. The casting/acting, the plot, it all worked so well. I really enjoyed Jenna's portrayal of Wednesday. She did a wonderful job. I loved how prominent ""thing"" was. I loved the no bs lines & subtle inclusiveness that allows this show to reach a wider audience. Plus throw a classic love triangle in the mix and I'm hooked. I wish there was a little more of morticia and Gomez, but alas this is called ""Wednesday"" for a reason. I really hope this gets a second season! It's definitely great as a stand-alone, but with how well it's already been received, I think a second season is well deserved. Another win for Tim burton in my book!!",10
North America,"I grew up loving the Adam's family, so I was looking forward to this show since it was first announced, and man did it deliver. The cast was perfectly chosen. Ricci is hard to forget as Wednesday, but Ortega was made for that role. Her dark sarcasm hits every single time. I especially loved that they casted a Latina, since the Adams are Hispanic in the first place. The show was just so much fun! Wednesday's growth through the episodes was such a blast to witness, she is hilarious. Honestly, props to the writers and directors and literally everyone involved because this was an absolute hit! I liked it so much that the silly cgi can be easily overlooked. I can see this show and this version of Wednesday becoming huge. I recommend everyone watch this, you won't regret it. The bad reviews are from people who are stuck in the past. You're allowed to enjoy a remake without it taking away from the originals, if anything this adds more to the past characters we loved. Give it a chance!",10
North America,"I don't know if this was based off the cartoon or the original tv show (the remade movie with Huston and Julia was similar to the TV show. I know nothing about the cartoon except seeing some ads for it a few times. But the Gomez in Wednesday looks similar to the Gomez in the cartoon. So when I make any comparisons it will be based on the tv show and the Huston/Julia version compared to Wednesday characters.First, Gomez, horrible casting except he looks like the cartoon. In the TV show and the Huston/Julia movie you could feel chemistry between them. Huston gave a dark, somber version of Morticia which was similar to the original. Julia was the suave and lovestruck Gomez. Gomez is OK in most of his roles but a suave and deadly with a sword type he is not. Zeta Jones just doesn't have what it takes to be a Morticia. She was an OK actress when she was in her prime and IMO her looks carried the lackluster acting. To be honest both are too old for the roles.Wednesday did a good job of being the dark and cynical Wednesday. You could picture her as the younger version from the TV show. When she went to the dance and actually danced I thought that is out of character and then I remembered the episode in the original where she was showing off the latest dance craze.Uncle Fester was a fairly decent reproduction of the original. Pugsley I was not impressed with. Lurch...Well what can you say about a character that mainly walks around and groan. While it was funny in the original it just doesn't seem like Lurch. I wonder if we will be seeing Cousin It and Grandmama in future episodes. My only question was other than being weird what was the justification for the Addams going to Nevermore? Supposedly Thornhill was the ""first"" normie at the school. They have vampires, werewolves, sirens, gorgons, shapeshifters and other things but I don't believe they have ever said what the Addams are.Anyway, if you liked the original then Wednesday is a good reproduction if you overlook Morticia and Gomez. Now if this was based on the cartoon and that is how they are like that then forget this whole ramble :) But for some reason I picture the Gomez cartoon character as more like a weasley Igor type.",7
North America,"IF NETFLIX BREAKS MY HEART BY NOT RENEWING FOR SEASON 2 I WILL NAIL GUN THEIRS. ??I loved Addams family as a child. I grew up adoring my favourite, Morticia Addams! But damn, I love Wednesday and Thing now!Obviously it has its own weaknesses here and there, but as a whole it was lot more interesting and cool, actually made me binge watch!Sometimes it was hard guessing who was behind all of that, but sometimes there were also predictable moments. Yet it was awesome and was saved by breathtaking performances!Yeah, you have to be a little weird to like our Kooky and Spooky Wednesday! Anyhoo she doesn't care if you don't! ??",9
North America,"I give it 5 for all the visual production values. If this series would've been called ""the adventures of goth-girl, starring Thursday Maddams"" it would've been okay, maybe a 7. But this is NOT THE Addams Family. It's a travesty. They ""harrypotterified"" the concept of The Addams Family, and almost all the characters are nothing like their counterparts from the sixties OG series or the 90s movies.And maybe because there's one key element lacking: humor. At the core of TAF, even the original cartoons, lays humor. The blunt contrast between every day ""normal"" life and people and the Addams' weirdness. And all that is completely missing in this series.The story is ok, but kind of very predictable, as it is with many products these days.The cast is almost ok, very much like the original cartoons, but there's something missing. I guess maybe Raúl Julia's Gomez settled the bar very high. This is not an argument against Luis Guzman's casting, but the characterization is very far from what we've seen in the og series and the 90s movies. It's the same with all the characters, except foe Uncle Fester and Thing, although the last one also lacks some of the humor from the originals. Jenna Ortega does a very fine job as the titular character, but she's written almost flat. Well, I mean, the original character, especially the one from the first movie is almost a punchline, and is better fleshed out in the second movie. In the end, she's just ok.Tim Burron and Danny Elfman are mere shadows of their former selves. They could've hired anyone as director and the results would've been the same. Maybe the hired em just for the weight of their names.Bottom line, this series it's just another ""big mac"". Another burger combo made for streaming. I'm baffled with so many uber positive reviews, but be it, it's ok, watch it if you want, but it's just another proof of the lack of innovation and imagination in a decaying medium, and it's consumers' taste.",5
North America,"Let me prephase this by saying I loved the Addams Family movies. The 90's versions were my favorite and Wednesday was among the top reasons, if not the very top.Now with that out of the way this series is just amazing. Everything from the plot, to the atmosphere to the repartee is extraordinary! My only issue is the casting of Gomez and it's got nothing to do with anything that the current actor did, it's just... Everyone's a step down from Raul Julia. I'm sorry but when you've seen the best, it's kind of hard to stomach anyone else in that role. Having said that the rest of the cast did a great job especially Wednesday herself. Whoever decided to cast Jenna Ortega is a genius. I can't think of anyone more perfect for that part and she delivers perfectly.10/10 this is how you revive a show the proper way.",10
North America,"I love the person acting as Wednesday. She did a great job and couldn't do better. I know a lot of people are talking about how this is like Nancy Drew. It kinda is but... well, there is Thing and Uncle Fester there to help with that. Thing and Wednesday carry the show. Uncle Fester is just the icing on the cake. The only thing wrong is the people acting as the parents of Wednesday and her brother. I'm looking forward to season 2. I have already watched all eight episodes twice, and I'm looking forward to watching them again. It got me hooked and I had no idea who the killer was. I had some questions, but I researched them. I'll put them down below in case you guys are wondering the same thing. Don't look if you haven't watched all eight episodes!What powers did Eugene have? He can control bees.How did Crackstone have powers if he hates outcasts? His staff has powers.What are sirens? They can control the sea and are mermaids when underwater. They also can sing and with their song make you do things or think things.Why did the monster kill Rowan and not Wednesday? The teacher needed Wednesday on a blood moon for the sacrifice.I had no suspicions about Tyler except at the end. I knew that Tyler was a bit odd, but the scratches on his belly when Wednesday and Enid and Tyler went to investigate the Gates house set me off track. I have watched this series two times now, but still have questions about the third episode. At the very end, Wednesday was talking about how she didn't believe in coincidences. The screen showed different scenes of different people, like Ajax turning to stone while Enid was getting mad and was attacking the bus out of rage. It also showed a scene of the principal and the teacher, and those I didn't get. What do those scenes have to do with coincidences?I'm sorry if this review contained spoilers. To be honest, this is the best Tv show in the world. It got me stuck in the house for almost 2 days straight watching it. I finished the entire season twice in around 3 days. I am so hyped for season two. If there is one, of course. I have another question though. At the very last scene, it showed Tyler transforming into a monster, because he is a Hyde. My question is, does Tyler need a master to control his transformation? If so, who is the master? If the answer to the first question is yes, then there will probably be a season two. I also love how Wednesday said at the end, ""I know the suspense is killing you."" That makes me think that there are more episodes coming, and I cant wait!",10
North America,"I'll start this off by saying that i'm not super familiar with the source material, therefore I will be judging the show on its own and a standalone piece of fiction.This show is unbelievably bland and generic, the protagonist is an overly edgy teenage girl whose response to everything is ""i will kill you and murder you ahahah"" who hates her mum like every other teenage girl and doesn't wanna be like her. She's written like a protagonist from a self insert wattpad fanfic written by a 13 year old girl.The other characters aren't exactly riveting either, they're pretty bland and generic and fit into personality archetypesThere are very cringe references to pop culture along the lines of ""You should post on instagram, snapchat and tiktok!!"" that kinda just seem to scream ""these kids are hip and topical"" but only serves to make me cringe.The special effects and CGI are noticeably not great x everything looks especially fake and like it doesn't belong but I understand it has a budget of a netflix original and not an MCU movie, but i've seen originals with better CGI such as Umbrella Academy.Overall it feels like this show was made to market to preteen-teenage girls and is not especially riveting or engaging.",3
North America,"How could anyone compare to Christina Ricci's Wednesday, I thought going in to this. Jenna Ortega nearly did, possibly would have if the story didn't focus on her, and she could have just deadpanned one-liners here and there like CR's Wednesday did. But since the show is all about her, well she's darn awesome. JR is definitely my second favorite Wednesday behind Ricci. Which is saying a lot because Melissa Hunter's 'Adult Wednesday Addams' was pretty amazing as well.I won't give away any spoilers. I'll simply say this is a must see entry for any Addams Family fans. I like Luiz Guzman's Gomez better than John Astin but not as well as Raul Julia. Catherine Zeta-Jones is servicable as Morticia but no one will every be able to own role as Carolyn Jones did, and Anjelica Huston was a little more enjoyable as well.The supporting Nevermore cast were all quite good as well. Do yourself a favor and watch this. It's fun, even if you aren't a Addams Family junky.",9
North America,"Teens written by middle aged YT men just needs to stop. This feels like a higher budget CW show that stole from Harry Potter. The darling unique and charming Addams family are made pathological and weird.I love Luis Guzman, but due to makeup, hair and costume choices, his Gomez Addams is grotesque. Catherine Zeta Jones as Morticia is lovely, in spite of costume design that isn't glamorous or very flattering. She is a passionate, energetic actress and so I did miss the more cool and regal self possession of previous Morticia;s (just my personal preference). Sadly the best thing about the Addams isn't portrayed well for most of the series... their love and unconditional support for each other and unity as a family. More emphasis was placed teen drama that makes no sense (such as Wednesday despising her mother).In the show a line reads ""I've always hated the term 'write what you know'"" and some thing about stifling creativity. That feels like the motto of the writers on this show (and sadly many others streaming today) where ""creativity"" seems to mean pulling poorly planned series out of your a$$-pirations.Wednesday is skillfully acted and really, really fun to watch, but she's written with such discontent and often malice. And they felt the need to write her an origin story??? Wednesday doesn't need an origin story, she is a fully formed character by nature of her family. It's quite insulting.It was uncomfortable seeing Mortician and Gomez act apologetic and embarrassed, not to mention absolutely having no chemistry. Pugsly is written as if he is an afterthought. The principal is fantastic & one of the better creepy elements of the show. Most of the other actors are very well done.One last thing that really bothered me are the gross jokes and innuendo throughout. Enid is made the butt of some especially crude and disgusting jokes. Fred Armisen is especially abrasive and you're left wondering did he write or embellish his own jokes??",1
North America,"This show has very little to do with the original Addams family show or the movies from the 90s. I don't know whose Wednesday this is, but I don't recognize her mannerisms, actions, nor aesthetic.The beauty of the Addams Family was that it was an eccentric family living in the normal world. So choosing to place her in a school for outcasts defeats the whole point. What was anyone thinking while making this?Love Jenna Ortega as an actress, but her face is too conventionally beautiful to be Wednesday. They should have casted someone with a quirkier look and essence. She relied on these Gen-Z esque quips to show how eccentric and cold she is. Television and movies seem to have lost the art of ""show, don't tell.""Catherine Zeta Jones and Luis Guzman were so unsexy, I don't recognize them as Morticia and Gomez. No chemistry.What's with the teen romance being so prominent here? In Addams Family Values, Wednesday and the outcast boy like each other at the end, but it was more organic, not shoved down our throats from the beginning.However, aside from this baffling portrayal of Wednesday and the family, it is a well made show. I was able to finish watching the series. So if you like teen shows of the 2010s and beyond, you'll enjoy this. I do not like this category, so I personally hated this show.Also, it was extremely predictable. Good luck!",6
North America,"This is..... disappointing. That's it. Very very. To be honest I wasn't hyped for the movie cause i already knew it was not going to be to my taste. Netflix adapting Addams family. It was going to be a waste of time. But then I actually watched it and I felt new depths of disappointments. Turned the movie into a ""teen supernatural romance"" kind of movie and removed all the dark humor so as not to offend anybody? Lol. When did Pugsley become such a wimp. I couldn't even feel the love between Morticia and Gomez. I wouldn't too cause Gomez has never been a fat, ugly, creepy man. They are supposed to be a weird misfit family showing their love in their own kind of way to each other. But the parents are not proud of their children's behavior. I'm suprised with all the tens I'm seeing. I'll have to say they come from people who haven't seen the original. Cause this is definitely not the Addams family. This is some cliched teen supernatural romance where the weird girl falls in love. I'm done with this. I can't keep watching. Enjoy.",1
North America,"""Wednesday"" TV series from Netflix is quite good. They even managed to keep the intrigue till the middle of last episode, which is quite rare nowadays. My only wish would be to have a better world-building, because it is almost non-existent here outside of the plot-related stuff. Maybe people more familiar with Addams' lore can better navigate it, but I have quite a few open questions about the world.Regardless, Ortega was good in the role, and I certainly would not mind another season. Luckily, the ending does suggest a possibility for one. Would not surprise me if it will get 3rd season, too.",8
North America,"As there are so many positive reviews, I almost did not bother but that would be unfair to such excellent storytelling,, acting, set design and direction of this series.It is very worth of Bing watching as you try to solve the culprit or culprits through the series.Jenna Ortega steals the show as Wednesday and is obviously going to be a world class actress for the future. There are scenes where you just feel there is no way she could have kept the Wednesday poker face when filming them. I think there would have been a lot of laughs making this, The supporting cast are first class.Personally, I enjoyed the direction of the series both light for comedy value and dark when required. If you are not a Tim Burton fan this maybe a negative for you.I would sum it up as Harry Potter meets Fantastic Beasts meets Scobby Do meets the Adams family. An absolute joy to watch.Do I want a second series? Very rarely do I say this but yes please with even more mystery than this one.",10
North America,"This series is a masterpiece. It has the right amount of everything, horror, action, drama, and the most difficult to get right which is black humor. Balance is the most difficult to achieve in this genre of series/movies. Personally, I found the original Addams to be too much of everything. Wednesday is dark, proper dark.Jenna is extremely talented and well suited for this role. I hope we witness her evolution through this series. The famous dance scene is a sight to behold. Tim Burton has also done a great job.The costumes are great, especially Jenna's outfits. The atmosphere, as well as the magic and mystery provide a harrypotterish vibe.One star is removed due to abuse of contemporary terms such as ""mansplaining"", but mostly due to the mass violence scene in the first episode. U. S. Schools have had enough of that already. Kids need to learn how to defend themselves and resolve their issues. Blind rage and violence is not the solution.",9
North America,"Show wasn't bad. Just wasn't amazing. Zeta Jones had the right look, but didn't have the right mannerisms or attitude. Gomez was probly the best surprise in the Addams family. Wednesday could have been better, pugsly was weak. And of course netflix had to add wokeness into it on more than one occasion. All in all it was a decent watch. But I won't watch it more than once. Definitely not my favorite, and definitely not on par with the 90's version.Really had higher hopes for this show. And really had high hopes Netflix would do it justice to the original. But it fell flat to the movies. If you just take it for what it is, it won't be a disappointment. If you compare it to the movies, it's a complete let down.",6
North America,"This show seems very specifically targeted for tweens. It is full of teenage drama. I decided to give it a try despite my reservations because the score was so high and Tim burton has made many excellent movies. This show should be on the CW. I can't believe Tim burton made this. It doesn't have that feel at all. It also doesn't have the adams family feel. At this point, why even make a reboot? Why even make something that already exists and change it until it's nearly unrecognizable? Where are the original ideas? I only could force 3 episodes because I was so bored and I hate shows about teenagers. The casting of Gomez was so awful it was distracting. I was literally cringing when his gargoyle looking self was trying to caress the stunning CZJ. Gomez is supposed to be smooth, handsome, romantic. This Gomez came off as a creep. CZJ tried. She was beautiful at least. Wednesday did fine, but so much of her charm, quick whips, and deadpan was missing mostly because her dialogue just wasn't funny or sharp like the original. If you have watched the original show, or the 1990s classic movies, you will probably be disappointed. This show feels more like a knock off Harry Potter. Don't believe the score, and don't expect much. If you can stand stupid teenage problems, this is the show for you. If you are a mature audience and love the originals, just skip it. It also can get a little preachy at times with its messaging. I'm guessing a lot of people won't exactly like the message. I didn't mind it, as I mostly agree with the views, but I'm just warning people.",5
North America,"I have to say that I was a bit hesitant at first, scared it was going to be a standard Netflix flop. Let's just say I am positively surprised and it's definitely one of the best series of the year. Brilliant, funny, dark, a bit gory and beautiful visual scenes. The casted actors are just what I imagined the Addams family to look like, almost nostalgic, and they fill the role perfectly with a touch of individual personality. As the series progresses you really start to pick apart each character and every detail seems well thought trough, from costumes to scene lighting. I am already waiting for season 2!",10
North America,"I just finished it, and it is really, REALLY good, undoubtedly the best new Series on Netflix. Lots of expectations when Tim Burton put his Name on this Series, but kudos to him and his Creative Team for delivering the Goods big time.It just so good on so many levels, first is that it is not only about the Dark Humor and quick, witty Dialogue, there is a lot of multi-level Storytelling also involved, giving most of the Characters a lot of depth.A lot of talk about how Jenna Ortega was absolutely perfect for the Role, but for me it just wasn't her, most of the other Actors and Actresses also did very well, helping contribute to just how good this Show is.Take Catherine Zeta Jones, for example. I wasn't sure if she was going to be a good Morticia Addams since Anjelica Huston in the Role was a pretty hard act to follow, but she delivered wonderfully, proving that she could indeed still be good in a Comedy Role.You know this Series will be full of dark, quick wit, but it still catches you wonderfully off guard at various moments every time it comes, like when Wednesday told Gomez she knew he didn't have it in him to be a Convicted Killer, then Gomez says he forgives her even if what she said ""stings"".The Soundtrack is also pretty good, something that is certainly noticeable, they were turning Classic Songs from the 1970s onwards into an Instrumental played by an Orchestra.SPOILER ALERT (Don't read this if you don't want Spoilers), I'm glad the previous Wednesday didn't just go into the Series in a Cameo Role but was in fact quite a Pivotal Character. We may even see more of her in succeeding Seasons.Anyway, this THE Must-Watch Series on Netflix right now, and looking at all the buzz it is generating it seems a lot of other People agree with it, too.",10
North America,"Jenna has finally done it with this one everything she did in this show was amazing & fantastic she really surprised , shocked me with her acting in this i hope to see her in more bigger projects now since this one is becoming her biggest project yet good to see her achieving big roles & tim burton is finally back and set it off with this one as an major fan this is now one of his best projects aside all his amazing projects proud to see him back and giving us an masterpiece and can't wait to see what else he has in store for us and hope to see this receive a lot of awards. Hopefully we get season 2!!",10
North America,"I never write reviews but for this one I definitely had to ! By far the best I have seen. It's so interesting that once you start watching you can't stop . Undoubtedly this is the best new series on Netflix. Jenna Ortega did an amazing job, also the other casts they too did so good , they just got so perfectly. With all the twists and turns , it keeps you guessing right through the series . Hopefully Netflix doesn't cancel it and hopefully there's more seasons to it .I can't wait for more .Thank you Tim Burton , you definitely did an amazing job . Honestly the bad reviews I don't get it. Personally I loved it .",10
North America,"From time to time, you find a tv show that makes you spend a whole day consuming every second of it. It doesn't happen quite often, which, for a lot of people, is the point for considering if netflix is really worth the price. But with ""Wednesday"" on the catalogue, it's totally worth it.Maybe this is not a masterpiece that deserves a 10 star rating. If i dissected the show, maybe i'll find it's flaws. Nevertheless, what's the point? I loved it! Sometimes we just have to embrace a good show and enjoy it, without trying to look for ""mistakes"".I can say that i was felling pretty confident with my ability of solving murder mystery's, after reading countless books about it. But with every episode i had to reconsider my suspects. I had to finish the tv show in that day, because simply needed it to know the end!It kept me hooked throughout the whole time, and let me tell you, it's been a while since that happened.Wednesday is a must watch!!!",10
North America,"What an amazing achievement this is. The casting is en pointe!! Catherine Zeta Jones is the perfect Morticia in this brilliant horror tale that will have you biting your nails in a delightfully tense way!Tim Burton has delivered yet another master peice; Wednesday is well portrayed as are the other characters.With utter brilliance, the story unfolds, interesting and draws you in from the start. The costumes and scenes are spot on and are the adding touch to a well written story.Lastly and but not least, how wonderful to hear the clever music of Danny Elfman who has eluded us of recent days, his score is awesome. The music compliments every mood of the series. Well done to all and thank you all so much.",10
North America,"It is one of the serials that are started without expectations, to fill free time, but watched and finished in a single breath.It both took us back to our childhood and ended the season leaving a good taste in our mouths.And the tim burton signature already makes it one click ahead of other series.The series is a classic Tim Burton piece. It has become a watchable series with a cool character network that does not tire the subject, which is enjoyable to watch. Of course, there will be those who criticize, but the fact that even a garbage producer like Netflix could not spoil it shows how high quality the story is. I liked the lead character very much, I don't know if I internalized it because I found inspirations from myself, but the story drew me in a lot. I hope it continues.",10
North America,"To be honest, this series is one of the best of Netflix. Jenna Ortega is fascinating in her role as Wednesday. She plays it so good that you always want to see Wednesday in every scene. Except that, all the characters, the topic, the places, everything is spot on. It gives a bit of a Harry Potter vibe with the school etc but it's definitely one of the best TV series I've ever watched! You might think the series seems childish or disney-like but i can assure you that I've thought the same at first but it definitely was something else from both Netflix and Jenna Ortega. Plus, we all know Tim Burton who directed this series, and we know he's extraordinary. Definitely worth the watch!!!",10
North America,"Truly I wondered what this would have in store when I first heard about it. The first glaring problem I saw was the fact that it didn't even seem like an Adams Family edition. It did seem quite contrived for what it was. Almost all Netflix shows I've ever watched are beautifully shot, well casted, and has decent action. The only thing that they lack in is the writing department. This is no exception to that.It truly just seemed like another Netflix teen drama that is an unnecessary dissection into Wednesday Adams only to repaint a feminist icon into the new geist of what is today. A twist to add in all of your political criteria while bringing in the ethos of what many younger women feel they are today; intelligent, self-sufficient, witty, sarcastic, and with a little bit of angst and cynicism. I know this is how the character is in a nutshell more or less, but this rendition seems more Gen-Z and contrived compared to the nuance I think the character should have.If it was done in a film or mini-series format it might have sat better with me, but them turning it into a Tv show is where the unnecessary dissection really comes into the foreground. I'd give it a 5 for me but maybe for people who are actually less like real personality of Wednesday Adams, you might enjoy the watch.",5
North America,"This is every other CW, ABC Family teen drama, nothing new, nothing special. Somehow they made The Addamses boring, except Wednesday, which in this version is a stereotypical whiny brat teenager. They don't think too highly of the audience either, everything is dumbed down to the lowest common denominator, then spelled out and repeated just in case it went over your head. Charles Addams made comics that were separate from the norm, the 60's show brought them into the ""suburbanite"" world and highlighted them as different from the 9-5 husbands and housewives, the 90's movies rewrote Fester's backstory and added to Gomez and Morticia's physical and emotional attraction, this makes Wednesday look dull and especially vanilla. Luckily it's very forgettable.",2
North America,"Wednesday 2022 is an unoriginal combination of Harry Potter, Gossip Girl, That's So Raven, Twilight, Veronica Mars, with the characters from The Addams Family but only the characters, not the family. It uses the Tim Burton label for marketing purpose with only 4 episodes directed by him. It checks its production checklist but failed at telling a good story.My problems with the series (spoilers):It undermined the weirdness of the Addams by having a school full of so called weirdness which made it less weird. It's not the family against the world but rather the magical world against the normie world. But whatever, I can accept this setup, this is the least of my problems with the series.Nevermore is supposed to be a school for the outcast but it also chooses to outcast certain monster types, like the Hyde? It's just a magical school, not an outcast school, and you still have to fit in to be a part of it, which makes me think the creators of the series doesn't really know what it's like to be an outcast/misfit.Why would the villain go through all the troubles to try and resurrect a normie? Crackstone was evil but he had no real powers, he just hate magical beings, without his followers what can he do? But then he's resurrected and suddenly he had a magical staff out of nowhere and became a powerful sorcerer? And if you need magical power to destroy the magical school, then your hate has no base. It's just a silly plot device. The villain could have had those killings to drive a wedge between the normie and Nevermore and seed the hate between them and have some real damages.You have Ricci, the original Wednesday, should have made her a permanent role to side along with the new Wednesday, instead of making her a poorly written villain that barely had any screen time and only lasted a season. What a waste.The series is not too bad, Ortega gave perfect performance, the colors and cinematography are great, but the series is just not that good. Too many people seems to like it and giving it too high of an appraisal that it just doesn't deserve. I have no intention to pretend to be a film critic, but I'm a film lover and a fan of The Addams Family, so I give my opinion.",6
North America,"Wednesday is so good , cute , warm, pleasant series that I have watched recently. It is combination of movies and series that I watched and liked. I think it is really similar with with Harry Potter. Like Harry Potter in Wednesday has magical school, 4 houses , competition like triwizard tournament , friendship ant etc. I wish they should show school life , vampires ,sirens , wolves more.Netflix should give more budget for this series. Because visual effects at some point was not so quality. But places, set , general ambiance which is created by G. O. A. T Tim Burton can changed eveeything in a good way and you even dont pay attention to the effects.Jenna Ortega was iconic as Wednesday. She is such an great actress and has real potential. She was born to play Wednesday.Christina Ricci who played Wednesday in the film in 1991 plays Miss Thornhill in this series. I was surprised when I heard. Even an episade where she said to Wednessay ""we are similar to each other and have something in common"" was subtle detail and she also played perfectly.Screenwriters wrote lines splendidly. Of course there is Tim Burton factor. We need to appreciate screenwriters who write scripts, lines , character so perfectly. Jokes are so much funny ,humorous, laughable and lines that given us in the sentences which showed how family is unique , extraordinary and maniac was perfect.If you like Harry Potter , Stranger things , Chilling adventure of Sabrina , Fear Street
You are going to love it.",10
North America,"Netflix has a documented history of butchering characters from other sources. I give Tim Burton credit for not doing that here. I was not expecting a murder/mystery series but this worked well. The writers left very few clues so that you don't know for sure who the villain(a) is until closer to the end. I personally prefer there to be Easter eggs pointing to who that is but this leaves it open to be anybody.Regarding Jenna Ortega, I think she did an amazing job. Considering she is 20 and portraying a 16 year old, she brings a lot of experience and skill to the role. At the same time, it also makes you appreciate how well Ricci did in the 1991 movie. She was only 11 and did a remarkable job and still portrayed some innocence.Ortega does a great job showing teenage angst and rebellion against their parents, like so many teens do. Understanding the two are portraying the same character but at possibly different ages, allows one to believe in a continuance of the character; like the series The Crown.",9
North America,"This is a very well done show with great acting and perfectly morbid undertones. Ortega nails it as Wednesday from start to finish and really carries the show... brilliant, talented and dark! The sutures on Thing's hand were a nice touch, and it was good to see a few of the other characters get an introduction, including Lurch and Fester. No Itt or Grandmama yet, but most at least had an appearance.The only real gripe I have is the casting of Gomez. Gomez is supposed to be a sword fighting, lion wrestling, non-stop energy force of nature, and they cast a morbidly obese actor for the role. He's a fine actor but just all wrong for Gomez Addams. He's only in a couple scenes in a couple episodes, so it doesn't really matter, but that was a huge miss. Pugsley and Morticia were perfect though, and Fester was fine.Other than that, it's fantastic... I hope they pull an Emily in Paris and just announce a multiple season extension on this gem while the actors are still the right age... 3 more seasons would be amazing. Highly recommend!!",10
North America,"Season One: 8/10Themes: Paranormal, Mystery, Romance, Crime Solving, Comedy, Outcasts, Anti-Social Behaviour, Monsters, Dark, Serial Killer, Family, Love Triangle, Friendship, Gothic & High School.Review: This was surprisingly fun with a hint of darkness. The main character has an interesting and macabre personality, which results in an engaging mix of strange things she does and says. Seeing her interact with other people is often humorous, and a lot of her relationships managed to capture my interest. The plot was also pretty well-developed, albeit slightly repetitive. Overall, I thought this was a good show with a nice vibe and some decent acting (especially the main actress portrayed her role well).Top five characters: 1) Wednesday Addams, 2) Thing, 3) Xavier Thorpe, 4) Enid Sinclair and 5) Larissa Weems.",8
North America,"OMG this snippet tv show of the Addams Family movies is spot on and awesomely captivating. The young lady playing Wednesday did her thang and gave the Addams most beloved vindictive character the best portrayal yet.I laughed. I cried. I was in shock over the twists. Definitely rate this a Must Watch. Excited about the next showing (hopefully soon)!I also loved Catherine Zeta-Jones portrayal of Morticia. Disappointed about Gomez and Uncle Fester's actors. But hopefully they will get better as the show progresses.Hit for Gomez actor: Kiss Morticia rapidly and passionately from fingertips to shoulder and back again ;) ijsFor Uncle Fester actor: Be more suspiciously adorable.Ohhh btw you won't recognize Christina Ricci. I didn't until my oldest daughter told me which character she played ;0 No Spoiler. You just gonna have to watch the show, see and fall in love with this new versions of The Addams family teen daughter for yourselves. ;)",10
North America,"First let me just say, I'm a huge Addams fan! So when I heard about Wednesday I was beyond apprehensive to say the least. But with Tim Burton being apart of the first season I had some hope. (Also a Tim Burton Fan) Within the first few minutes I knew this show was going to be great! Jenna Ortega is the perfect Wednesday. The script is phenomenal and is not cheesy. The show is not overly gory but definitely takes a lot of suspenseful twists and turns which leaves you wanting more. I also love that they cast Christina Ricci the OG Wednesday as Marilyn Thornhill. Overall each character had a decent storyline where enough information is given without being too complex and muddying the story. I can not wait for Season 2! Netflix don't let me down!!",10
North America,"Jenna Ortega is amazing as Wednesday Addams. She plays the role in a morbid and cynical way that is perfect for the character. She is also wonderfully twisted and sadistic. The story takes place at Nevermore Academy which is like a dark Hogwarts. There are werewolves, Sirens, Gorgons and more outcasts of society. Wednesday fits right in with this bunch of misfits. Gwendoline Christie does a fantastic job as the cheery principal. I love Catherine Zeta Jones as Morticia. Thing is great and cute in his own eerie way. I also like that Christina Ricci, who played Wednesday in the movies, is in this show as well. Great show that is creepy and fun at the same time.EDIT: The finale was the biggest ripoff of Harry Potter I've ever seen and it shouldn't have been.",8
North America,Let's start with this is not the Addams family movie from the 90's very much different take. Im glad Tim burton is back to bring his style for this series. The actress that play Wednesday Jenny Ortega fits the character very well but I don't care for the back and forth with her character the moments when she's trying to do the right thing and call the police and stand for what's right idk just doesn't feel like the true Wednesday character it bothered me the whole series maybe I'm still holding on to Christina Rocco version. I do like the other characters like Enid she felt felt like a Luna love good type similar from Harry Potter not exactly but Enid and the other characters were fine. The plot of the monster and who it is they dragged out longer than they should've I felt like they could've done that with in 1-3 episodes and then developed it more into something else this had a scooby doo vibe here. I do like everything else about the show just these thing's kept sticking out for me.,7
North America,"I found the show charming and entertaining but that's about it. Wednesday excels at everything. I understand child protégés which usually applies to 1-3 subjects but not Wednesday she excels at every single thing she encounters in the show. It becomes less worrisome for her character's survival when she's basically perfect and unbeatable. She's never challenged, always gets the last word, and can beat up groups of boys double her size without changing her facial expression. I'm pretty sure she is the next avenger. The other characters are pretty good. I like her roommate well enough. Sir Brienne of Tarth is great in her role as the headmistress.",4
North America,"Let me start off by saying, I've been a huge fan of Addams Familys since the black & white TV. The first DVD I ever bought was the Addams Family live action movies. While not all Addams Familys projects were a hit for me (especially the CGI movies). Wednesday is a HIT!I wasn't sure what to expect when it started. Especially after I didnt hear the double snap in the intro, I almost felt like it wasnt going to be for me. It felt like it was going to be another ""weird family trying to fit in"" story at the very beginning, I was even thrown off by a 'thats so raven'-esque moment in the first 10 minutes. But it quickly transitioned to a COMPLETELY different type of show which can be best described as ""Nancy Drew"" meets ""Hogwarts"" meets ""Monsters High School"". While that sounds atrocious, with Tim Burton at the helm, it worked out great.They took what was probably the most popular Addams Character since the early 90's movie, and made an entire story about her growing into her own. No longer is Wednesday a 10 year old girl, but a young woman.The story itself starts off as a subtle 'who dunn it' mystery plot, but once it picks it does get very interesting. As someone who normally figures out the plot before reaching the end, this one definitely had enough twist and turns to keep us guessing until the very end.Where I do feel baited and switched is the case that they got a lot of high profile talent for this show, only for all of them to play very small parts. Luiz Guzman and Catherine Zeta Jones feel like they make brief appearances, I wouldnt even be surprised if they arent in a second season (fingers crossed there is another season). It definitely feels like the rest of the Addams family (outside of Thing) was underused. But the show is called Wednesday, so this should be expected.At the end of the day, I didnt know what to expect, but was definitely intrigues by the world the built, and enamored by Wednesday Addams herself. I thought this might end up as a tween-age highschool drama, which there were moments of that, but it definitely had Veronica Mars type deep mysteries that kept you guessing to the very end. There are times when you feel sad for Wednesday to the point of almost tears. With Tim Burton and Danny Elfmans added touch, this show is a winner.",9
North America,I grew up watching 90's Addams Family Films and am a big fan of Christina Ricci's impersonation. When I first saw the remake adds I did not have high expectations at all but decided to give it a chance anyway on a Sunday afternoon since everyone in my household is sick and omg we finished the whole season 1 in one sitting. My husband enjoyed it and my kids too. I was delighted to see Christina Ricci in the series as well. The only critic would be CZJ as Morticia. I would like to see her really dive in and deliver as Morticia I don't feel she has yet.Favorite scenes were Wednesday's cello performance and dance!!! Jenna Ortega is fantastic!!!Can't wait for Season 2!!!,10
North America,"My first 10-star review for a long time:) Exceptional adaptation, no empty characters. Very specific atmosphere - dark and noir, but not depressive, well done combination of humor and darkness. Cheerfully gothic - if this is possible :)All together - music, plot, dialogues, logic and characters - so wonderfully mixed. Single episode feels like a big music video.The only issue I had is The Monster. There is something so comedic in the face and those huge popped out eyes, that is it hard to take it seriously. Illustration to the ""What happens when pug goes nuts"" :)Hopefully there will be season 2, can't wait!",10
North America,"Creepy, kooky, mysterious and spooky, and I'm usually first in line for ooky....however, THIS is not that, nor what I expected. I was first kind of shocked this historically family-oriented show was bloody and violent. Then it got kinda monotonous and a bit boring. Yes, I made it through the whole series....while cleaning house, folding clothes, cooking and pestering my dogs. That said, I must confess, I'm an intense watcher of good stuff, sometimes watching things over and over, never missing a thing, and discovering more each viewing...like Joker, Scarface, Silence of the Lambs. But once is enough watching Wednesday. I too, was a bit disappointed in how Gomez was cast with Luis Guzman. I enjoy his work, but cast here, was a chemistry mismatch for Zeta-Jones. Jenna Ortega, cast as Wednesday, can certainly hold her own and I think is an up and coming, attractive and talented actress. I would be compelled to watch her in something else. Regarding Uncle Fester, I heard him before I saw him and thought surely, it was Steve Buscemi. Nope. Fred Armisen. As for Wednesday, shame on her for belittling and bullying Thing, whom she counted on a lot.",6
North America,"If you're going to change characters to this degree, make new characters. I don't understand the drastic changes to well-established and beloved characters we've been seeing in Hollywood for some time now. There's nothing wrong with taking inspiration, but taking liberties such as the ones seen in this show is, in my opinion as a huge fan of the Addams family, completely unacceptable. I don't see how any fan of the Addams' could enjoy it unless you completely separate it from every other version as though it existed in some alternate universe. As much as I hope Hollywood will get the message, I'm not optimistic.",1
North America,"Well Christmas is just around the corner and to get the happy, nostalgic, old time feeling ( for the grown up kids) this is the series.I was just glued to it and only complain I had was why only 8 episodes? Well I know that is why it is this good..duh. But still
The storyline? Awesome
The acting of each one? Out of the world
The suspense?? Wow
Acting of these kids were so good I wonder what impact they will have when they grow up?This is kind of series one can sit together with whole family with some munchies and hot cocoa in a cold winter day and enjoy.I guess if you watch it now you will again want to watch it once you run out of feel good series again.",9
North America,"I'm a 40 year old man, but I still found this extremely entertaining, I can't wait for another series. Addams Family does Harry Potter, but funnier! The family finally get the Tim Burton treatment and it doesn't miss a beat. Danny Elfman also contributes the perfect soundtrack, not that I expected any less. This brought back childhood memories, whilst feeling totally appropriate for the time. And extra special shout-out for Jenna Ortega - although Wednesday has never been this old, she was absolutely spot on.I don't want to include any spoilers in this review, but I really hope some of the characters that didn't make it to the end somehow return, this is my only complaint.",10
North America,"I love all things dark. I like horror, Addams Family, Tim Burton movies. Naturally i couldn't wait for this series to come out and i almost wept with joy because it was so good. It was enticing, exciting, hilarious and so well done. The music was great, camera work, outfits. Tim Burton manages to bring his dark vision to life once again. All of this cast was amazing. They managed to give Wednesday and her Family a new spin, without loosing the kooky, spookiness of them. I couldn't tell the end of this murder mystery, until the very end. Escapism at it's best. I will forever rewatch. I truly hope Netflix renews the series for a second season.",10
North America,"I'm not familiar with the original version of the Addams Family, but I was hoping to see something interesting from the once intriguing Tim Burton. I gave up in frustration at the end of the fourth episode. Oh yes, Burton really seems to have lost his mojo at this point, at least in my opinion. Jenna Ortega is really good and plays the character well, but everything else is mediocre to be kind. A few interesting sections (Wednesday playing the violin on the roof, the dance scene, and a few quotes) are not enough to make passable a series that mixes the most boorish teen drama with the most generic detective slash monster story possible. Too bad indeed.",5
North America,"From Director Tim Burton comes a new Netflix series ""Wednesday"".Something old - ""The Addams Family"" - presented in a very new way!Think ""The Addams Family"" meets ""Supernatural"" meets ""Harry PotteR"" Hogwarts school.My Logline; ""Wednesday Adams, daughter of Gomez and Morticia Addams, finds herself an outcast in a school of outcasts at Nevermore School, her parents alma matter. Experiencing visions and a violent murder, Wednesday soon finds herself investigating a monster in the nearby woods and a school hiding many secrets.""I thought this might be a series for young teens but soon found it intriguing and oddly compelling. All the family members from the Addams family are here, with Katherine Zeta-Jones playing Morticia, Luis Guzman playing Gomez, and that wonderful actress Gwendoline Christie (of ""Game of Thrones"" fame) playing a shape-shifting school principal.There are strong echoes of ""Supernatural"", especially in the Harvest Festival scene, and of Hogwarts school in the Botany Class scene in this series.This is a wonderfully written, spectacularly cast, well-acted, and beautifully filmed series, which can be enjoyed by young and older adults.",9
North America,"I likes this a lot. It's like other reviews say; it's a bit of a teenage movie with a bit of Addams family.. sure there are plot holes, sure there are 'convenient truths' to some thing, but on the whole it was humorous, entertaining and made me want more episodes.. and that's all a series needs to do.. looks good, nice music score and enough fun to be entertaining without losing a story in line with the Addams story. They missed a bit from my view on Gomez, but other than that I can't wait for season two to come around for, if nothing else, a few entertaining hours of content. It was good enough for me to write a review, that makes it one to remember..",8
North America,"I feel like the series got a very good start and they manage to capture the audience attention through the trailer and how it tell the story. Another good point the crew make is that the way how they introduce the world and character. However , I feel like it would be better to make a full horror movie than this kind because I feel like it got both genre that fit for 13+ and horror which make the movie is like you know what I mean. Moreover, i feel like they are too ambitious with the character since they got more character than they need and some of them got more time than the other and some character can just be remove without big impact on the plot. Nevertheless, the audio is so good and like I said before since it a Tim Burton movie, it got a interesting way to tell the story. Last but not least, I have to give credit to the actor since they did a outstanding performance but the visual effect is like so bad and I find it ridiculously bad which is the main reason I only give it a 7 when it deserve a 8.",7
North America,This is one of if not the best new shows in a couple of years. Jenna is so awesome and adorable as Wednesday Addams. She is an incredible actress she manages to play both emotionless and vulnerable at the same time. Watch this show. You will love it. Tim Burton did a great job. The whole cast was great. Gwendoline Christie is so different in this this then Game of Thrones. Fantastic in both. Can't wait for season two. Don't screw this up Netflix. Fun for the whole family. Jenna is so good at delivering those lines. I know people are bashing Juan Guzman as Gomez however he was excellent. Creepy and Cooky. Catherine Zeta Jones was gorgeous sexy and Morticia completely.,10
North America,"Netflix is synonymous with producing some over rated rubbish. Wednesday though it's simply the best series I have seen on the Netflix platform or that on a whole.I absolutely loved Jenna Otega's portrayal of Wednesday Addams she is a fine actress whom I'm sure we haven't seen the end off.The series had a predictable ending but that aside, it was so magical, dark and brought out a softer side of Wednesday yet keeping that cold, emotionless character that Christina Ricci developed in the two films in the 90's.Bringing Ricci into the series didn't undervalue it, nor was it necessary to add value to it, the acting alone from the principal characters made it a worthwhile, enjoyable watch.Let's hope there is a series 2.",10
North America,"Wednesday is a show about... well Wednesday. Christina Ricci stole our hearts as Wednesday Addams in The Addams Family and The Addams Family Values as its sequel so it comes to no surprise the franchise is brought back. The children of the Addams Family had a lot of screen time in the original movies so we are quite used to their perspective.In this series Wednesday joins a school for ""outcasts"" or more specifically for people with special abilities. Think Vampires, Werewolves, Sirines. The usual fantasy trope types resurface here. The show reminded me a lot of Harry Potter. It's a school setting with magical beings and magical things. It's obviously not as good as Harry Potter, but it kind of felt similar to me.You cannot watch this show and not try to make a comparison with Christina Ricci's Wednesday. And although Jenna Ortega tries her best I don't think there's anyone on this planet that can beat Christina. Her character superficially seems similar, but Jenna displays a more emotional version where instead of mischief we get anger and instead of cold stares we get anger and instead of a slight hint of superiority we get anger. Wednesday seems very angry at everything for some reason and it doesn't really help. Only sometimes do we see hints of the real Wednesday, such as the statue and Cello scene. Or the Piranhas scene at the start of the first episode.The men, as per the usual in Hollywood pictures nowadays where women take a lead role are all very weak losers that cannot do anything right. Pugsley her brother needs constant saving because he can't do anything himself. The original was never very smart, but he definitely wasn't a wussy. Her father turned into a short, ugly and obese waste of space instead of the ""zorro""-esque lover boy from the movies. The two appointed boys thrown in for Wednesday to be attracted to are both annoying and weak. On top of it all Wednesday painfully misuses the terms patriarchy, mansplaining and gaslighting when she doesn't get her way. It's all put in to make her appear independent and strong, while in reality it makes her play the victim. It doesn't suit Wednesday at all. But Hollywood cannot make a show with a female lead without complaining about men or how they are suppressed (even if those things are wrong or irrelevant).Storywise what's weird is that Wednesday seems very sure of her ventures and in an effort to get her way turns everyone against her and seems confused (and angry) as to why this happens. Also it's fairly easy to derive what's going on from a viewers perspective and by episode 2 you should have a firm idea of what's going on and who did what. It's all very very obvious. Yet you'll have to sit through 6 more episodes of Wednesday fumbling in the dark before she gets it. For how smart Wednesday is supposed to be she does come of very painfully stupid in this show. Which is a good thing maybe for her character development? It otherwise feels like a mismatch for her character. The original Wednesday Addams had plenty of character flaws already.The true star of the show is Thing. The hand that does it all. Has the best character, the best interactions. I think a series without Thing would be very mundane for sure. A honorary mention to Emma Myers as Enid who, with her colorful appearance and character, makes for a very interesting contrast to Wednesday. And while her character arc is very predictable it is very enjoyable to watch. Both Enid and Thing really sell the show and pushes it to be above average.All in all, it's a flawed series, but with a good budget and an entertaining story. Is it as good as the original? Well yes and no. Jenna will never beat Christina, which is fine, but it is very entertaining and perhaps even more so than the original. Jenna's version is likable dispite the flaws the writers pointlesly added to her character. Still, Wednesday in an indian outfit torturing another girl while slightly mischieviously smirking is how I will remember Wednesday at her best.",7
North America,"The actress portraying Wednesday is the saving grace. Production quality seems good enough, with some good contrast between Wednesday and other color palettes. Otherwise, it's a tween drama masquerading as an Addams Family story. The story could have been better with a little less predictability and the unnecessary modern-revisionist pilgrim history that was shoehorned in. It was a weird attempt to walk the narrow line of not offending most of the audience while still appeasing the self-righteous Hollywood powers-that-be. The reviews comparing this to bad CW shows are spot on, but I did want to at least finish the series. The 12-17 y/o minds may be the targeted demographic. If so, this will probably succeed.",5
North America,"The imagination of Tim Burton is out of this world. I laughed a lot, I was entertained a lot, and on top of this there are witty dialogs and quite a decent plot. The acting is top, and I could watch Jenna Ortega's look of disdain for hours :_D. There's a couple of moments in the show that I've watched dozens of times just to come to the conclusion that Tim Burton is a genius. One is when Enid is raging because her date and scratches the van (chapter 3 I think) ant the other one is in the chapter 7 when WD says ""Im not a very good GF, I will ignore you, break your heart and put my interests always on top"". Brilliant.",10
North America,"OK, I quite enjoyed the 90s Adam's family movies, and I also really enjoyed the newer animated movies. Wednesday totally envolopes everything I love about Addams family, and does a great job amplifying my favorite character, Wednesday.First of all, the plot/story of the show. It moves really fast (bingeable), it grips you right from the beginning and keeps you engaged throughout the series. Never a dull moment. You start wondering how things relate to each other, and then it makes sense.Next is the acting. Jenna nailed Wednesday. The perfect tone of voice, facial expressions, etc. Very confident and matter of fact. The supporting actors and actresses were also fantastic.10/10 would recommend. Super fun.",10
North America,"Overall it's a good concept but I don't like the idea of Wednesday having visions. It just feels like she's cheating. But I guess if the other kids are werewolves and gorgons, she needs some type of power.And Wednesday is a tad too nice for my taste. I was expecting a little less empathy and more comedic retorts. Maybe season 2 will steer in this direction.Most of the actors are good, especially Jenna Ortega, but Luis Guzman, Catherine Zeta Jones and the kid playing Pugsly are just terrible. Catherine is at least tolerable but Luis Guzman only knows how to play one and only one type of character and that's exactly what he does here.",6
North America,"This currently is sitting at 8.5. That's being generous. It's not terrible but it gave me a gothic Nancy Drew attends Hogwarts meets Pumpkinhead on the CW type of vibe. It's shot nicely and you can definitely feel Tim Burton's influence, which is a good thing, and she portrayed Wednesday pretty well but I didn't think CZJ and LG where a very good Mortica and Gomez. Like how Thing was a primary character. I was pleasantly surprised how much blood/violence was in it which added an extra star.It did sort of drag a little but overall I found it to be passable and worth a watch. I'd probably watch a second season/entry but wouldn't be disappointed if they choose not to do one.7/10.",7
North America,"Everyone is talking about Ortega (Wednesday Adams) and Tim Burton and sure, they deserve a lot of the credit but the truth is, the script is really well-written and the lines and storyline unravel flawless.It's pure entertainment, but don't let that stop you.The bleak view of Wednesday is just the perfect cynical voice of 2023, seeing right through the superficiality and advertisement of mediocre experiences.I loved her lines.I also greatly appreciated her delivery, quite perfect for such a young actress. Hands down to her.All the actors here played their part so well, including Gwendoline Christie (principal Weems), who has shown her true colors recently in another big part as Lucifer in The Sandman. Love her talent.Tim Burton strikes again, but I didn't expect anything less from him, this is truly right up his alley and he makes the most of it.What I noticed is that he kept his unique style while also laying down fresh, small directing details that are very much 'in' right now.He combines the old and familiar with the new in a way that's exciting and completely absorbing.I liked that even if it's probably targeted at the younger generations it's still a fun watch for adults as well. It kept me on my toes from start to finish, couldn't stop watching it.No unnecessary additions just to keep with the times, plain and simple morbid quirks in a fun, engaging atmosphere of contrasting characters and mysterious plots.I gave this an 8 because of the level of depth, but for a program of this type, it's as good as it gets!Give it one episode and you'll be hooked.",8
North America,"I was not thinking I would enjoy this! I never liked Addams family as a kid. Never really enjoyed it. Always creeped me out. But this! THIS WAS AMAZING!!! It had a splash of romance, the twisted dark humor, and reality teen drama! Watched it over thanksgiving break and even saw someone at my school watching it next to me! I really fought the urge to blurt out, ""OMG YOU'RE WATCHING IT TOO!"" But yes overall, amazing! Can not wait to see what happens next! So many openings for another season and it would be a shame to let this go to waist. It has so much incredible potential! Dying.... (pun most definitely intended) for a season two right now!!!",10
North America,"I understand the show is about Wednesday but seriously she is so hard to get to like... she's mean and annoying and selfish.What were they thinking with casting of Gomez? Ewwwww he has ruined the Addams family for me, he is just a poor poor choice with his hideous coloured front tooth lol why would Morticia want to be anywhere near thatThe show wasn't half bad, some actors were stiff and boring; like Tyler? The casting of uncle fester was also a weird choice, it could have been so much better but they made Wednesday into a character that was really hard to sympathise with, good shows get you enjoying the characters flaws and watching their growth, this show failed that miserably.",4
North America,"This show was surprisingly good, and something easy to binge watch, but after episode two the political bias was incredibly clear. I was looking forward to a good show, were I did not have to listen to things that should be kept on twitter, in court, etc. Keep it out of children's TV. The first half was provided, and this is a generally enjoyable, and good TV show with plot twists and surprises to keep one on their toes. Wednesday is portrayed well, and the actors are convincing. I recommend it, yet it is frustrating to see political topics, that belong on the news, social media, or court in a children's TV show.",7
North America,"Pretty bad acting by all other than the lead. Reminiscent of teen angers' first high school play The story line is mediocre. Bad writing. They take the Christina Ricci version of Wednesday and turn it up to 11. This is not a compliment. It is very forced. The creation of an Addams family universe has resulted in lore that borrows too heavily from Harry Potter. I cannot believe Tim Burton is attached to this. It is uncharacteristically bad for him.Production and effects are good enough. Just a notch better than a CW production. I understand people like this. It really does not speak to me. I am a fan of the original television series. I thought the movie adaptations were decent, but not great. That is where I am coming from.Edit: I've upped it from a 4 to a 6. It got better as the series went along. The teen actors seemed to find their hooves a bit, and the story line picked up. Still has many flaws, IMO.",6
North America,"If you told me a decade ago that Tim Burton would direct an Addams family reboot and that it would be so mundane, I wouldnt have believed you. Yet here we areLook, the cast here is pretty good and the acting is about the same as you might expect in a teen drama, though each member of the Addams family does a good job.But there isn't much else here to praise.The pilot it far too long, resulting in a fairly boring episode of TV. It's lacking in any sort of tension, which is a key ingredient of both horror and comedy, the two genres this is working to fit in.Visually it's broadly uninspired. A few neat choices but most of the set design, costume design, lighting, and cinematography is undistinguishable from any other teen drama.The characters and their relationships are much in the same vein as everything else. Wednesday herself feels very edgy for the sake of edgy, lacking in any clear motivation for her actions and feelings once the real meat of the episode starts. This is fine for her as part of a broader ensemble, but not as the lead in a showNotably, on all of these issues, the show is inferior to the very similar ""Sabrina"" show on Netflix.The show, especially with Burton directing, feels like it would have excelled with a more satiracle or post modern type approach, like the one he brought to much of his work in the 90s and 00s.The pilot does not provide a compelling argument to keep watching. If I do and it improves, I'll update the rating.",4
North America,"WednesdayThis is my first foray into the universe of The Addams Family, and I am pleased. The cinematography, styling, editing and costume is vibrant and rich. The soundtrack is also noteworthy.Jenna Ortega has proven to be one of the best acting stars of her age, delivering a charismatic and finely detailed, yet deadpan performance as Wednesday Addams. It's a certainty that she was born to play this role.Even though the movie is centred on Wednesday Addams, she has a bunch of interesting supporting characters. From the brilliant acting of Gwendoline Christine as Principal Larissa, to that of Catherine Zeta Jones as Morticia Addams, to the nuanced hand acting from Victor Dorobantu as The Thing, and finally the well juxtaposed Character of Enid played by Emma Myers. The other cast members I don't mention wouldn't be because of a lack in their performance, but to make this review concise.Netflix struck gold with this and I hope there isn't a dip in quality if further seasons are made.",9
North America,"This show was so awesome and I can't wait for more seasons. The cast is perfect, the music is spot on, the plot and twists and turns were so good. I'm used to not being surprised because of the typical predictable show formula. This is not like that at all, thanks to the brilliant Tim Burton. Edge of your seat, never saw it coming suspence at the end. I will say that some of the deaths and villains were sad when revealed, I wanted those characters to stick around or not be a villian but oh well. The show is slightly comparable to Harry Potter, Legacies, Vampire Diaries somewhat, with a little bit of a romantic detective show thrown in, Like Beauty and the Beast. But those comparisons are small because this series is its own thing really. I really enjoyed it. I need more Wednesday NOW!",10
North America,"Amazing. I was astounded how great of an actress she was throughout the whole series. It was shocking, questioning and kept me captivated the entire time. Delicious. It was weird at times talking about necrophilia...but other than that, top tier. Not sure I'm selling this, just watch an episode and you will understand. I watched the original series of the Addddddams Family about a year ago and it drove my wife nuts, but after knowing the back story it made this so much better. But then again ""Wednesday"" the actress crushed it. Just teasing whether or not there will be more episodes, please!!!!!That would be so rude, cruel, despicable and so 'Wednesday' to not have any follow up.",9
North America,"I Loved the Concept of this Series .It was a Great experience. The series Catches me in such a way that i was conscious to know the name of the writer and to know about more series with such Concepts. Simply exceptional. I love the colourful and black and white mixed up Beautifuly. The thing that i loved the most was W Adams Savage replies to everyone and her nature of not disturbed by anyone's words,and the fade way in which the writer changes her nature was some out of the box stuff for me .The series was very family friendly and Was Very meaningful at the same time. So its the pick of the year 2022 for me.",10
North America,"Wednesday is like an outcast Nancy Drew with a touch of darkness and a bit of ""Stranger Things"" thrown in.Wednesday is one of those rare shows that took me by surprise in an extremely good way. It (Wednesday) kept me intrigued and glued from the first episode to the last. It was hands down, the only TV show that I've binged watched this year. It's that captivating.The show while hardly original, is refreshing and unique from its point of view - a teenage Wednesday. The cast were well chosen (apart from IMO, Luis Guzman as Gomez Addams - Don't get me wrong, Luis is a great actor and I'm a fan, but as the suave and charming Gomez, Luis is not). Jenna Ortega did a superb job portraying the protagonist ""Wednesday"". Her acting is sublime. The other actors in the show did equally a brilliant job - kudos to the director (Tim Burton). And that dance. Yeah, the dance. You can't miss that part. I read Jenna choreographed it herself.Apart from the magnificent acting, the sets and directing were first rate. Tim Burton knocked another one out of the park. But I'm sure, it was made easy with Jenna Ortega in the main lead. Her take on Wednesday, took the character to a whole new level. She made Wednesday her own. Love it.VERDICT: Don't miss it. A must watch.",9
North America,"I am a huge Tim burton fan and Addams family fan and this show did not disappoint! I have counted down the days until it's released and then binged it twice in less then a week! Jenna Ortega was a masterful Wednesday and I can't wait to see more!!!!!!!!!!! She took a one liner character and turned her into this intriguing teenage girl who was relatable while still being Wednesday. I loved how she was able to be true to who Wednesday Addams is but show character growth and her own bit of emotion. Time Burton took a world we all know and love and made it more current and relatable. He did his usual magic on the screen and I loved it! The cast was perfect and the storyline kept you guessing! I will be waiting impatiently
to hear season two news!!!!",10
North America,"I almost didn't watch it when I saw who was portraying Morticia and Gomez. Zeta-Jones gave fat sloppy Morticia without an ounce of mystique and Guzman would have been more believable if he had play Uncle Fester in fact I thought the storyline concerning them was not needed at all; like someone cutting a puzzle piece to make something fit.I saw Tim Burton's name and I decided to take a ride and what a ride it was! This thing was GREAT! Wednesday Adams was a treasure, her deadpan was genious ( I'm 66 years old and I am looking forward to rocking Wednesday's wardrobe). The atmosphere, the witty and slick one-liners was on point! My favorite genre is who-done-it and this gem did not disappoint. With Tim Burton at the helm it gave excellent scares, believable characters, deft acting and this thing was paced beautifully. I was also happy to see Sir Lady Brienne of Tarth (Gwen Christie) featured in this thing.I binged the entire seies in one setting and never stopped for ??. It was just that kind of a roller coaster.Pretty Little Liars meets Riverdale meets Scream the series meets Wednesday!One final thing...I would like to see more Casting take in consideration the feelings of Black girls. The female police officer and the bald grease lipped Siren was not it. SMDH
Stop, its cruel to continue to cast the most unflattering Black girls in films. Stop.",8
North America,"Absolutely adored every minute of it. It's got that trademark Tim Burton look, which is great because I think he's the perfect choice to direct a film about Wednesday Addams and her family. And It's impossible to overlook Danny Elfman's score; whenever he and Tim collaborate, the results are nothing short of perfect. However, perhaps because Tim only directed the first four episodes, I found the show's style and tone to be inconsistent throughout the rest of the eight episodes. The show did a good job with the character arcs, albeit there were some unnecessary elements, such as the uncle's minor role. I thought the acting was good, but not really outstanding. Overall, though, it was entertaining to me.",8
North America,"One of the best Netflix shows of the year. The deadpan humor, the little bits of allusion to the Addam's family show (like the echo of the two snaps) and the actor that plays Wednesday Addams is dead on. All the characters are interesting. Everyone is a suspect. There is not a single episode that doesn't leave you with a thrill and you can't stop watching this creepy and spooky show. It's scary enough but not so scary that younger kids cannot watch it. There is violence and blood but much less than most video games. It also gives you a break from the spooky with loads of kooky. There's a little teenage romance, coming of age tales, and loyal friendships. All around, Tim Burton brings the dark spectacular to life.",10
North America,"Wednesday... interesting seeing the incredible high feedback score for this series. Personally, I wanted to rate it higher, but ended up rating it a 5 out of 10. Why... well various reasons really. First of all, spotting Tim Burton and Danny Elfman already gives you goosebumps thinking back of Edward Scissorhands and Nightmare before Christmas, and although Wednesday as a series is nice and entertaining, it came nowhere near the other two movies mentioned here, and I'm actually being nice here. Secondly, the endless following of social agendas, especially thinking back of the original Addams Family, seems just so wrong. Not looking for a new Addams Family story, but one that stays true to the original, including the original music score and characters. Think only Uncle Fester came close to the character as portrayed in the original series. Thirdly, the story itself has embraced too many ""Harry Potter"" elements, which just made the whole show a bit sad and lacking the originality I'm used seeing produced by Tim Burton. Wednesday is just a female version of Harry, and nothing more than that really. Last but not least, found the storyline messy and extended to infinity for no reason whatsoever, other than trying to fill up eight episodes with the same-same over and over again, and am just not buying in to that, as quantity does not equal quality. That's why Big Fish will always remain one of the best movies ever made, it's exactly the right duration. Anyways, that's my feedback. So, although Wednesday is nice children's entertainment, it doesn't belong in my list of top productions. 5/10.",5
North America,"WEDNESDAY is awesome, one of the best shows i have seen on Netflix!!!!! The acting of Jen O is so good, she is wonderful as Wednesday, her delivery of her lines is perfect! She alone makes Wednesday worth watching. Then there is Tim Burton, he has done a wonderful job of bringing this sbow to life, the mood, the camera work, the sets, is all deliciously wonderful. The supporting cast is also very good, i love Thing!!! Then there is the story, that has so many levels, Wednesday's life and conflict with her family, a new school, Wednesday and her visions, the creature killing in the forest, and what mysteries are going on at the school. Wonderfully yummy tv!",10
North America,"Jenna Ortega as Wednesday is absolutely amazing, it feels like she was born for this character. She is by far one of my favorites actresses of this generation.The supportive cast is also really good, you feel for some of this characters ( my favourites in this show Enid and of course Thing).You don't need to know all about the Adams, just knowing a little bit about them is all you need, this show is all about Wednesday with of course small cameos from other members of the family.The big reveal at the end felt a little bit predictable for me, but the conclusion is really well executed.Overall I think people should give this show a chance, I promise you is an amazing ride.",9
North America,"I had been waiting a few months for this show to be released, and I was not disappointed. I found the plot intriguing and some characters interesting. My only critique I have against this show is that some parts were so unnecessary. It felt as if they were trying to add so many different characters and events, but with the limited time they had, events felt so rushed, and characters so underdeveloped. Every episode a new kind of event thing happened: a ball, a race thing, a carnival, it felt so unnecessary. I feel like if they had focused more on like the school or some it would have been more interesting- like they built up the ball to be this big thing and it honestly kinda sucked, it definitely didn't live up to what every character was talking it up to be. The characters... where do I start? Wednesday was well written. I enjoyed her character, and she was so unintentionally funny. All the other characters felt so rushed though. They all had about one defining character trait and that's about all their personality was. The friends of enid's or whatever, I can't even remember them they were that irrelevant. So was Enid's boyfriend. Their whole love story felt so irrelevant again, felt like something the writers added in because- how dare anyone write about teenagers who don't have romantic lives! And Wednesday's love interests: again not needed. Love triangles are so overdone in film nowadays, it's just not interesting. Anyway, besides the millions unnecessary events that occurred and the underdeveloped characters who got into romantic relationships with little to no chemistry, I did enjoy the show, and I hope to see where it goes if it gets renewed for a season two- which it probably will, due to the attention it's receiving on social media.",6
North America,"First of all, I get that this isn't an Addams Family story or Not defined in pre-established narrative. But regardless of that, the plot was just a typical cliché.Jenna Ortega was amazing in her role as Wednesday. She portrayed a character that was unapologetic, confident and unreserved.Wednesday Addams establishes herself as the no-nonsense girl that enjoys her independence and takes no concern over what other thinks. This quality is almost consistent throughout the series, however the plot and directing basically attempts at condemning this trait. Wednesday is basically forced to attend Nevermore Academy in order to make her more sociable. Proceeding to which she is roomed with Enid, a jubilant and colorful girl who makes a sincere effort to be friends with her. Enid's dynamic with Wednesday brings out a new dimension to friendship where both girls are able to accept each others quirks, the chemistry between them works pleasantly. From there on the rest of the plot just basically tries to weaken her character as a girl who is overconfident and insensitive to other peoples feeling. Wednesday is put in-between two male leads who only care of dating her and becomes eventually becomes theme of the plot. The series attempts to make a character like Wednesday to be helpless by herself and that only others can help her solve problems. The romance element the series attempts to inject is also very unnatural, where the two male leads are repeatedly thirsting to date Wednesday despite her overt attempts at rejecting them. But this eventually leads to her being worn down to like one of them. The plot hits every cliché plot device from framing the wrong suspect to making the other male lead the cliched villain all along. Although Wednesday keeps her dark gloomy stature, she is painted as a helpless girl that is better off with love. Wednesday initially started the series as a strong character only to have become conformed to the standards set by those around her.",6
North America,"There is little to nothing in this show that hasn't already been done, with the only appeal being Jenna Ortega's faithful and enjoyable portrayal of Wednesday. The show just feels like the writers watched Euphoria or Monster High and wanted to try it out only with more cliches and a TERRIBLY forced love triangle and needed a recognisable IP and loved characters. They attempt to add depth to characters with their own family struggles but they ultimately don't go anywhere and most don't matter to the overarching story line. The treatment of Enid's character development particularly irks me as it is actually relevant in today's climate, despite being ham-fisted and completely lacking any nuance, and is only ruined for a cheap and quick fight. Enid's cheap fight is only bested by the embarrassingly short and bland climactic fight between Wednesday and a painfully boring resurrected Crackstone.In the end if you like The Addams Family and coming of age shows you'll at least find this enjoyable but it leaves a lot to be desired.",4
North America,"Way too boring for the adult audience .The shift to teen drama may work for an audience that is coming into contact with the universe in question for the first time, but its execution does injustice to the rich legacy that cartoonist Charles Addams' creation has left us .The success of the Addams family was based on a clear logic. We may be weird, different, more macabre for your tastes, we may even seem like a broken family, which is impossible to fit into society, but the truth is that the real threat is the seemingly normal and ""normal"" people who surround us.With difficulty I managed to follow the whole series.I almost slept through all the episodes.",4
North America,"Its about a school of freak and wednesday adams solves a mystery about a monster whos is killing normies and school kids you wanna stick up till find the end of the series best series it reminds me about hogwards but freaks one the monster name is hyde.i was worried it wouldn't be able to compete with the other versions of the addams family but WOW! This was amazing!Normally i don't do reviews but i'm just so blown away. From the casting to the acting to the set design to the plot and storyline, wednesday has completely left me speechless in the best way! I grew up watching the addams family movies and loving them for how weird and odd and endearing they were, this fits right in.",10
North America,"If you are an Addams Family fan, don't watch this expecting that same family you know and love. This is simply put another in an endless line of established known titles used for an easy. Segway.. i cant even begin to. Emphasize how unfamiliar these Addams? Are from their original counterparts. Typical, rehashed modern day stale toast, served up just how they like it. Truly anyone who thinks this.is fantastic or anything above 5 stars must also think. Space Jam 2 was a cinematic coup. I really went into this with an open mind, praying the feeling i already had from the cast and previews was premature, but oh no. My spidey senses were right on the money. True This Addams Family doesnt have to be like any of the others, but at least carry on some sort of reminiscent feeling that made so many watch this in the first place. Watcher Beware. This is try hard central. Or look we dressed up as Addams for Halloween, arent we cool?",4
North America,"Let's be honest, the Best Wednesday Addams was portrayed by Christina Ricci, the only features that Ortega succeeded in copying Ricci are Wednesday's Blade Sharp comments & Emotionless face.The Rest of the show is Like a bland recreation of Harry Potter's Hogwarts with all the riddles, quests and secrets Just themed by The Addams Family.The YouTube Girl made a better Series for Wednesday but was lacking the looks.Gomez Addams is more like a Cartoon Gomez Character than the ex movies and tv shows, I prefer Raul Julia's sleek and chic figure than this Gomez, and plz leave the wide waist circumference to Fester it suits him better.Pugsly here is a whimp, norm kid ..useless lump when I describe it like that it sounds right but it doesn't look right on the show.And what a pity choosing Catherine as Morticia, Cher would've made a better Morticia Addams.Lurch is ok kinda Frankenstein's monster look..but thing with all the stitches looks like Lurch's hand fell off...but not nad either.So it's like watching Harry potter but starring Wednesday Addams rather than Harry Potter.The best thing here in this show is that Ortega succeeded to be 55% Christina Ricci's WednesdaySad attempt but we like it, and Why!!!??Because we're the Addamses.",5
North America,"Tim Burton and Crew have hit this one out of the park!Masters of the craft in this genre.It could have been a huge failure but they told the story as authentic yet fresh.The entire cast fit into this kooky world brilliantly, the new characters and world that was created for the show far surpasses any expectation that I had. The story tied in wonderfully and seamlessly to the Addams family world. Jenna Ortega was absolutely the perfect Wednesday .Each character had a reason to be there and even though they are not the main story you still want to get to know them too.Season 2 please!:D.",10
North America,"I really am not sure if this has to be a comedy, mystery, horror, parody...? Once again Netflix try to profit from well succeeded movie ideas. Jenna Ortega did play Wednesday well, but everything else was just unbearable.Adaptation
Wednesday Addams would never dress herself as a e-girl tik tok style. She loves the classy dark gothic clothes. It is half half here. Sometimes she really looks like Wednesday's taste ,but sometimes not. Wednesday also doesn't really stay with neutral face the whole time. In old movies and cartoons if you'd like sometimes she does show some emotion no matter is it when she tries to be spooky or jokingly spooky or tired of crap. What is it with Gomez? I mean he really really doesn't look like him. Even tho this is about their daughter. There are no monsters in Addams movies,stories,scripts. So where did werewolves and vampires came from??Locations
Nevermore is basically Hogwarts. They have social groups that are really much accurate to the houses of Hogwarts. The style of the school. The spookiness, the fact that all the shots are taken night and with lightings and thunderbolts to make it spooky as with Hogwarts, i guess , where is the magic? Oh wait, Rowans sudden telekinesis. The room from which Rowan took the book at ep.2 (i think it was) is exactly like that one part from Harry Potter franchise movies where Harry found an empty room with a mirror and the mirror showed him his parents and etc.ClichesFighting scenes
Totally unrealistic with the exception of 1-2 moves out of 10.",2
North America,"It's been a while since I last watched something that made me this angry. I don't understand why they decided to take an iconic character like Wednesday Addams and ruin it. This has nothing to do with the Addams Family. The main character is just a basic, moody teenager. The scene that shocked me the most was in the episode where that guy with glasses (I didn't even bother with names) tried to kill her and her face showed actual fear. Really?There are so many wrong things and it's all because they couldn't give this girl another name and decided to use a classic family as reference. I wouldn't have any problem watching this thinking it's just a mystery series with supernatural elements.Overall it's just a disappointment. So sad.",1
North America,"I walked into this tv show thinking i would see a completly kids tv show like the movie (the addams family) but i was happy of how it came out to be more than that its more like an inbetween a normal tv show and an adult tv show also loved the way they portrayed the charachter of wednesday in a realistic way also not so realistic but good enough,also loved the way they show the environment in a subtle way that kinda gives you a sense of how the characters feelthe show has a nostalgic side that satisfy anyone that watched the old movie as a kid but in the same time a person who didnt watch the movie wont feel lost.",9
North America,"It looks like it could just be any boring Netflix TV show. But when I tell you this is GOOD. I watched all 8 episodes back to back. I couldn't put it down. This show has a great mix of murder mystery, romance, drama, and horror. Wednesdays character was displayed perfectly. Everyone around her is colorful and witty and she is emotionless and dark. (So we thought) The ending really made me tear up when she hugged Enid. It ended when we just got to see Wednesday step out of her emotionless vibe. When she was just starting to create her own path at the Nevermore. The first season was just a touch on the surface of getting to know the characters and i hope we get a nice long season 2!",10
North America,"Even Jenna Ortega (who Carrie's the show), Christina Ricci and Gwendoline Christie who exceed in their roles can't save this show.Where is Tim Burton?? Not in this show that's for sure!! Since when did Wednesday develop feelings?? She's iconic in her darkness and sarcasm which are lacking here.This is only a pathetic blend of Sabrina the teenage witch, Harry Potter and X-men that they decided to add ""the Addams Family"" in the mix and even the Addams Family is not present at all.Some will argue it's about the daughter. But I don't know who this Wednesday is because it's definitely not Wednesday ADAMS. Loved Christina Ricci's Wednesday and I'm sticking with that version and the original in black and white. This would have been pleasant if it had been called differently with other names for the characters as it is exactly that...same names for the old characters we love but with a much changed scenario, plot and overall lack of dark humor.I'd say it deserves a 4.5 but since there's no half stars I'll give it a 4.",4
North America,"After watching the trailer I could tell something was off about the show. Not the typical Addams family dynamic. As other have mentioned, another angsty teenage sci-fi drama... I don't mind if they have a show centered around one character, but we're heavily missing the connection between the rest of the family. All of the characters are different. Good job on appearance, but the personalities don't match. Gomez seems a bit quiet and reserved when he's normally a showman. Morticia appeared to be too positive and hurt by Wednesdays pessimism and distance from her. Pugsly was just a little wimp that relied on his sister's affection. I love Fred Armisen but his Uncle Fester was horrible. Wednesday's (Jenna Ortega) performance was better than I thought it would be from first glance but still nowhere as stoic as it should be, but much more harsh and cynical to the point that shes an outcast in a school filled with outcasts and everyone she 'befriends', ends up hating her for the same reason they liked her, but have no problem with her by the end of the series. They still have some of their odd quirks but no one really seems fazed by them, or they quickly accept them as almost normal. The plot was quite predictable and the same thing you've seen time and again; new student shows up, mysterious things start to happen, dangerous monster, constant misdirect showing who you should think is the culprit when it's painfully obvious who it is (and isn't). Some of the deaths were unnecessary and quick to the point and the last episode seemed kind of rushed, could have used a couple more episodes to flesh out the resurrected Pilgrim ancestor, his random magical powers, and plot to kill outcasts, despite sort of being an 'outcast' now (undead and magical). The main baddie got a simple K. O. in the end, with no explanation what happened to them afterwards. The final scene obviously leaves off on a cliff hanger, opening it up to another season, after we see the 'monster' reappear. If you want to keep the same spirit of the first season, that's fine, but at least make new mysteries, dangers, monsters, and villains, don't rely on reoccurring characters.Overall, it was good for a laugh, some of the jokes were funny and on par with the Addams family, some of the characters were well done, I loved the interactions between Wednesday and her roomie. The camera work and symmetry as well as the wardrobe/makeup/set design, were all great. Other then that, it kind of fell flat, was kind of slow, boring, and as mentioned before, somewhat predictable. As a stand alone show, it's alright; as a continuation of the Addams Family Legacy, it was quite a poor representation, as it was more of a reimagining of the world The Addams Family lives in. Tried to write a spoiler free review but I think I went a little into too much detail ??",6
North America,"Really enjoyed it. Was expecting a train wreck as the originals were so good. But nope, spot-on. Gomez was an odd casting choice but besides that nailed it with the rest. Wednesday was great and enjoyed her room mate personality split. Hopefully more of Wednesday being twisted in the next season. Good humour and love the finding of beauty in the dark and the gloomy. Like didn't quite get that the normies are aware of monsters? But not a drama. Good fun show well worth the watch. Should have killed the mayor's son and his mates tho. But maybe next season. Better than a lot of the other stuff Netflix puts out.",10
North America,"Where do I even begin? It's so freaking awesome. The suspense that built after finishing episode made me so addicted that I couldn't stop watching it. It's a show that I would always watch it again. Truly awsome, The actors were right on spot and never made me feel bored. It's my new favorite show. Plus it's a show that was hard to predict what was going to happen next which is something that I truly like and makes the viewer stay hooked. Wasn't expecting all the twist and turns. Hope they make second season which I would definitely watch it based on this first season. The ending left me speechless and left more questions for me.",10
North America,"Among all the other sludge that has been released on the movie and tv-show front over the past few years, Wednesday is definately refreshing.It's far from ""perfect"", with some strange character choices, repeating plot points, and somewhat plotholes, but overall I enjoyed it.I'm 36 years old now, so I'm probably not the intended demographic, but even for me it was quite decent.16 year old me would probably give this show a 9 or maybe even 10 rating.I don't know what else to write, need to fill up some more characters in order to post this. Almost there. Just a few more. There we go..now.",7
North America,"This show mixes a lot of the elements from successful franchises like Harry Potter and Riverdale then backs it up with a lot of the original dark humor and lore from the Addams family. The result is a bit of a ""super powered teen soap opera murder mystery"" and, while this mix could easily flop, ""Wednesday"" totally makes it works.A big part of the success is due to Jenna Ortega's amazing performance. She's perfect as Wednesday but the supporting cast, especially Emma Myers, also deliver in their performances in a way that's campy, fun, but also heartfelt. The direction and production value are also solid. Totally a quality show.While I haven't finished the series yet, my only complaint would be this: I think there's some inconsistency between the Addam's family history / lore of diabolical behavior - indeed a lot of Wednesday's dark jokes infer terrible things her family has done in the past - and one of the main story arcs where a member of their family is accused of murder. Without giving anything away, the character's reaction to the accusation seemed way out of character to me. You'd expect the Addam's family would sort of laugh it off, or be like ""yup, that makes sense. Next."" but instead it seems to conjure up feelings of mistrust and betrayal, which just seemed odd considering there are plenty of other jokes where the family is kinda like ""oh yeah, our uncle is a cannibal"" and then nonchalantly moves on.This isn't a major criticism, and I'm still very much enjoying the show I just think it's weird that the whole family is a celebration of ""the dark side"" but then, in this one instance, they're like ""oh no, that would be bad behavior"". Lol, wut?",8
North America,"I stopped watching after the fourth episode bcs I didn't get convinced by Wednesday's reason to stay at school and play Nancy Drew. Also, I really would like to see scenes from Wednesday's dark deeds as she describes them or just flashbacks, not just empty mentions as if they are gonna make us believe everything she says. If you wanna keep ppl watching then show them the stories. People are here to watch, not listen to tales. Some characters just don't fit the story. Especially Wednesday's roommate. I wish the whole series had been given to Tim Burton to write/direct. Corporate agendas are clearly showing themselves. Pity.",6
North America,"It's like some random producer said ""love triangles are popular with the demographic we are aiming for"", and honestly, they would be right in thinking that, it's a great way to infuse foolish jealousy and petty drama into any situation. Hell, if I'm gonna be fully honest, I found myself shamelessly enjoying the absurd ""are you going to the dance with this guy? How could you?"" situation. Sure, it was ridiculous and completely unearned when it comes to setup, but it was fun and outrageous. Furthermore, it was quite unreasonable of either of the boys to expect a romantic relationship from her when she gave no indication of liking them at all. Honestly, they barely interact enough for any real feelings the boys could have to be believable. If they had actually put in some effort when writing the romance, it could have been intense and weird in the best way possible, but for that to happen, Wednesday would need to be a version of herself who's capable of putting herself out there for romantic love. She not only lacks the vulnerability required for satisfying romantic development, but she also seems to actively dislike the idea of romantic love. This is exactly what would make her the perfect asexual character, it proves that there is nothing wrong with not experiencing sexual or romantic feelings, you can still care about people and be a good person, but on your own terms. To me, there is nothing more Wednesday than to be yourself regardless of what people think you should be, so when they tried to push this onto her, it felt uncomfortable and wrong. This is still a great show with a pretty bad final villain and ending in general.",9
North America,"The mostly excellent cast and crew are just that in their roles, costumes, set design, cinematography, editing, direction, effects, score, everything. It's just about two episodes too long though with story lines and subplots that do not need to be included. Especially for the supporting characters, who are great in their own performances, story lines, and character arcs with no need for the multiple back stories. That is minor compared to the outstanding performances of the leads the supporting characters. Even though they totally gave away the ending in the first episode and the twist was as predictable as the cliff hanger.",8
North America,"I didn't see any trailers or reviews about this show, it was relatled to the Addams family and that was enough for me since I am a big fan and had seen them all.What I'm trying to say is I started to see Wednesday blindly without any expectations or whatsoever and God I am happy I did that.When I started the first episodes I was really impressed
The casting is absolutely amazing and the gory Addams atmosphere was totally there
That's was surprising to me until I saw that the Director is the brilliant Tim Burton who ,of course, master this gory grey atmosphere likewise Nightmare before Christmas, Corpse Bride and others.You can see Burton's fingerprints all over the show.Wednesday is really fits to the role
Plot is solid and very entertaining
The show get you hooked since the 1st episodes
Soundtracks are excellent;
Chopin,Metallica (nothing else matters)...
Also using Edgar Allah Poe in the plot was a great a nice touch and kinda a tribute to this brilliant author/poet
Overall this is excellent work and I watch all 8 episodes in one night.Kudos for the actors, actresses, writers and everyone who shared in this amazing piece of art.It's a solid 9/10.",9
North America,"Everything is impeccable here: faithful costumes, good art directing, beautiful cinematography, great narrative and it's characters and mainly Jenna Ortega's delightful performance as the character-title, her acting is impressive and I think she's one the most talented actors today. But the fact they made a horrible CGI of the creatures disconnect me a couple of times when I was watching. I don't know if that was the idea, if they wanted to do some trash movie vibe or something, but if it had a Stranger Things level CGI this thing would be perfect. Netflix should definitely renew to Season 2 and invest way more in the visual effects! 9/10.",9
North America,"Wow, just binge watched the whole season! It is one of those shows where you start to get sad that you're reaching the end of the episodes because you don't want it to end. This is hands down one of Netflix's best series, restoring some faith in the sea of mass produced mediocrity. This show is up there with Stranger Things and Queen's Gambit, my faves. Jenna Ortega is incredible as are the other actors in the show. The story line seems predictable in the beginning but there are lots of twists and turns keeping the watcher guessing til the very end. Excellent directing. Great story telling. I seriously hope they co tinge this series!!",10
North America,"My dad would watch the original Addams Family when I was a kid, I do remember the unique mannerisms of each character and the cooky, spooky lifestyle they lived. I remember liking Munsters more, but both were enjoyable enough. However I was basically the prime demographic for the films and, like many others, yeah, I loved them. Never saw the CGI one.I went into Wednesday knowing pretty much nothing about it except it was a spinoff based on Wednesday and Christina Ricci was somewhere in it.Indeed, I was quite pleasantly surprised. Honestly, I enjoyed it quite a bit. I only have a few complaints, and most fall under the same umbrella...But they had a VERY high standard to live up to...and I'd say they did as good a job as anyone probably could have.One thing I recall about the previous Addams family iterations is they didn't necessarily relish in the fact they were so weird. They just...were. It was sort of their thing, how they were basically oblivious to how twisted and odd they were, and it was everyone else who commented on it. Wednesday doesn't really follow this, which I do find disappointing...to an extent. In its defense, from what we've seen, it does seem to be mostly Wednesday who almost takes pride in her oddities, and the rest of the family is ^^as above. Of course, we see barely anything of the family, so we'll just have to see where they go with it.However, if you 'are' going to make this change, I think Ortega and the writers did as good a job as you can. It's not like she made a HUGE deal out of her weirdness, but it was still a shift away from the traditional Wednesday.The other major complaint is similar to others here. At its core, Wednesday really is a teen drama, a la Degrassi. Definitely not as cheesy and teenie as Degrassi, the show absolutely is made to appeal to adults as well, but it's a similar structure where most of the episodes in some way revolve around teenage drama at school...namely boys and popularity contests, ""proving"" yourself etc. Fortunately there was still enough ""adult"" content that I could just roll my eyes and laugh to quickly get over some of the cheese, but it seems more like a show made for a mother/daughter than a general fan of Addams, Burton, or all things creepy.Having said that, I enjoyed it immensely. I loved the dry humor and wit Ortega delivered so perfectly. She is, obviously, the real star of the show. I'm a pretty 50/50 Armisen fan but I don't see how anyone couldn't like his Fester. Is it Christopher Lloyd? No. But so what? He still did a great job showing the demented quirkiness of Uncle Fester. Just because it's different or not as good doesn't mean it isn't good. Lloyd's version was actually much more of a shift away from OG Uncle Fester, so if you don't like Armisen, you can't claim that as being a reason.Same applies with the family members. I think the 90s films pretty much perfectly cast the Addams Family, so Netflix had a high bar to beat there, and instead of also going for the ""perfect"" look, they decided to roll the dice and go with the ""new"" look.For the most part, it works. It will be divisive, but I think over time we will continue to appreciate THIS Addams family more and more. I admit, I don't 'love' CZJ's Morticia, but I don't hate her either. I'm probably in the minority of that one though so, take it or leave it.They are also clearly trying to capitalize on the ever widening gap of Harry Potter content, so Nevermore and Wednesday's paranormal adventures are very reminiscent of the Harry Potter movies...if you liked those, you will almost certainly like Wednesday. Just imagine Hogwarts but slightly smaller and if Tim Burton designed it, and they frequently visit Hogsmeade.And on the note of Harry Potter there is also a magic/paranormal aspect to Wednesday, which at first I was a little iffy on, but I learned to appreciate what they were going for...which is exactly what they said. A unique spin off with the Wednesday character, not a re-creation of Wednesdays past.My advice? Don't look too far into it. Take Wednesday for what it is...a portrayal of everyone's favorite sociopathic anti-hero prodigy...and you are bound to enjoy it.8/10, really hope to see more of Armisen and Ortega in a season 2.",8
North America,"I liked it until the script made Wednesday wear a dress that »will turn some heads«.When she threw on that catsuit two episodes before, I flinched. The dress nailed it.Sorry, but this will go unmatched.Wednesday is such a strong character. Surely there are ways for her to get what she wants without having to »turn heads« or »look beautiful«.Promising mystery though. If Wednesday can keep her independence, she would be a great mixture between Holmes and Poe. If, on the other hand, the script turns her into just another smokey eye hot goth girl, meh. Boring and so 80ies. Let her flourish and mete out punishment and torment like she ought to.",6
North America,"Perfectly casted series and exudes the Tim Burton quirkiness his fans love him for! Jenna Ortega is superb as Wednesday! I love all of her black and white wardrobe. I absolutely love Wednesday's dance scene, too??. I read where she felt very insecure shooting that scene, however she nailed it! It was very reminiscent of Beetlejuice when they danced around the dinner table. Christina Ricci being casted is nice touch! I enjoyed this much more than I expected to. The Romanian actor whose hand plays ""Thing"" brilliantly makes you fall in love with his character. I was surprised to find out this show was filmed in Romania.",10
North America,"This series was amazing. Jenna Ortega's Wednesday Addams is dark and wounded, yet Ortega manages to give her a compassion not normally associated with this character. I could watched her for a very, very long time. The supporting cast was excellent. Each character was much more complex than your usual characters which made for well-balanced viewing. I was really happy to see Percy Hyde White again. This cast includes some young talent I will keep an one on.I can't wait for another season to see how excellent a team Tim Burton assembles next. This series was very enjoyable. I hope Ortega's characterization of Wednesday shows growth in the coming season but retains the darkness we so love.",10
North America,"As an 80's baby i grew up with the 90's movies absolutely loving it. I also was born early enough to even see the series from way before that. I loved the Addams family and offcourse as a girl, Wednesday was my favourite. Hearing Tim Burton was doing this serie had me stoked allready, but the man absolutely knocked it out of the park. The serie is new and fresh, but also has a lot of recognition for the older viewer. Morticia and Gomes are still disgustingly in love. With Gomes still kissing Morticia's arm, Thing is still the same just trying to be there for the family. And Wednesday is still her dark self.This show however gives a huge dept into the character Wednesday. That Christina Ricci plays a roll in it is just is the icing on the cake. Especially when she says to Wednesday that she is just like her. Its all that little details that just make this show. Apart obviously from the great fantasy Tim Burton made of this serie full of monsters, weerwolves and other beautiful creatures. The serie Wednesday is the perfect example of making something new, with the respect to the previous films and shows.It is mysterie, excitement, adventure and a lot of fun with just the right amount of dark humor.After seeing the first episode i was allready extremely excited for the rest, that did not change anything after finishing the show.",9
North America,"I'm not an Addam's Family fan. I decided to check out this series due to Tim Burton's involvement, although Burton has had many more misses than hits of late. To my pleasant surprise, I would the first four episodes of the first season, which were all directed by Burton, to be extremely entertaining. Jenna Ortega's superb characterization makes an odd character very likable. That's the key to making this series work. However, to my disappointment, with episode five came Gough and Millar's trademark melodrama and over-the-top character angst. That killed this series for me. If you liked the melodrama of Smallville, you'll like this series as well. Personally, I would have preferred the series to have focussed primarily on Jenna Ortega's winning performance, rather than having it subverted into another one of Gough & Millar cookie-cutter teen soap operas.",6
North America,"The trailer for this show did it no justice. I originally thought ""oh another Addams Family tv show who cares"". I could of never been so wrong. My oldest was watching it with her brother and I sat down to see what they were watching. By the end of the first episode I was rushing to find the remote to hit ""play next episode"". It felt and played out like a Sherlock Holmes movie but with Wednesday as Sherlock. It was well done for a teen show. Some of it was predictable; but did enough to make you second guess sometimes. I like some of the little Easter eggs hidden throughout the show. If you watched the original or remember the original them song you will like the little nods to it throughout the show. I hope there will be a season 2!!",9
North America,"Meet the worst actress of 2022, Joy Sunday. Didn't like her character and those idiotic blue contact lenses have to go. Besides that, praise to Wednesday and the rest of the cast. The main character's outfits were beautiful and I wish more women dressed like her. Plus, Miss Ortega was incredibly funny in her role as Wednesday. Very creative series and each episode is a winner. Recommend. Remember, the original Adam's Family only last two seasons on television and became popular during constant reruns for the past 56 years. The Thing character almost steals the series from Wednesday, but she does an exceptional job. Recommend to all.",9
North America,"First of all...PLEASE stop casting people who are close to THIRTY to play high school and college roles! Joy Sunday looks and sounds more like a teacher than a student. Long hair on guys and bangs can't cover up the true age of these actors.With that being said; I miss the humor the Addams Family truly brought us. This is like Wednesday Addams goes to Hogwarts. She was more fun as a morbid kid than one with some sort of power.Entertaining, yes, but nothing like the dark humor I grew up with. As a young kid, the original Addams Family taught how to think of the irony of what the characters were saying. I guess with Tim Burton's touch, I was expecting more.",6
North America,"I was so stoked that Tim Burton would finally be directing a ""TV"" series and especially one based on the Addams Family's Wednesday, as I'm a HUGE fan of all of the above.Having the legendary director, a cast I like and the fact that this would be a Netflix original, (so as not to be limited in what they could do with this show,) it seemed the sky was the limit...Three episodes in and I am pretty disappointed. The writing is bland and the dialogue very rudimentary. I'm was expecting an intriguing plot with laughs, clever dialogue and even some frightening scenes and characters to boot. Alas, I have yet to see any of this unfold.I read a user review and thought this could be something dark, funny and twisted like the Chilling Adventures of Sabrina.... Instead, it has been more like the later, crappier seasons of a CW show, ala Riverdale, (which isn't my cup of tea.)I'm just bored with it so far and have little interest in starting the next episode when one ends.I will eventually pick it back up, because I love the Addams Family and Tim Burton. I'm really hoping that is gets better, because there is so much that can be done with the source material.I will say, the music by Danny Elfman is AMAZING!!!!!! The costumes are great and the sets are just fine. It's the WRITING and weak dialogue between the characters that have been a huge let down to me.Please, Please get creepy, kooky and spooky and just a little funny.",8
North America,"Exiting, thrilling, dark, mysterious with the darkest of humor and NOT for younger audiences. WARNING SHOW IS VERY ADDICTING it's so good I'm stuck on it I'm late for everything because I'm watching this show it is the greatest show ever. Also very funny in a dark way there's no laughing in the show and you can't tell sarcasm from normal talking but all of this is in a good way. The mystery will keep you up all night and the drama is breathtaking. Definitely not a watch together show more of a watch alone every moment of your free time show it is addicting so recommended that you watch on a weekend when you have nothing to do. Overall 100/10 Incredible show!",10
North America,"Thanks for this outstanding season, dark, gothic, each episode is beautiful. The film crew did a memorable job. We follow the episodes with greed, we want it to never stop, the scenario takes us into the madness of the gothic. The actress is perfect, she's gonna get an oscar because she plays so well. The casting is perfect, each young person plays his role, they are tormented, perverse, vicious, like all young people of this age because they build their personality. Each episode is truly a dark beauty diamond and honors to Jack Burton. This series is as beautiful as Andor, which will have an Oscar I don't know but we end the rotten year 2022 with fantastic TV programs, thanks to those who create, produce quality.",9
North America,"I'm a huge fan of the old TV series and the movies are fantastic. Maybe I had my expectations too high, but I can't understand how anybody who has seen any of the previous incarnations of the Addams Family could rate this show highly. The only positive comment I have is that some of the special effects are not too bad; thus 2 stars, instead of 1. However, the negatives are many. First, the character of Gomez Addams is extremely awful, Mortica is boring, Pugsley is a non-entity, and they even manage to make Lurch and Thing uninteresting. The Wednesday character is easily the best of the bunch, but that's not saying much. And, true to the usual nauseating Netflix wokeness, all of the male characters are violent and/or dimwits.I barely made it through the first episode, and based on the previews, it looks like it'll turn into a lame ripoff of Harry Potter. In any case, whatever direction it goes, it'll be going there without me.There was so much potential here, it's really sad to see it all wasted.",2
North America,"One of the worst things I have ever seen.Dull dialogue, uninspired story, unlikable characters and none of the charm that made us love the Addams Family.Wednesday as a character can't be saved even by the usually excellent Ortega who struggles to bring life to the dialogue that seems to be written by someone who has never spoken to a teenager, a goth teenager or even a human being in general. The little moments of morbidity are not funny and natural but forced and cringe inducing.The polar opposite (Enid) quickly becomes annoying and surprise surprise they are forced into some kind of friendship that Wednesday was trying to fight so hard but ""omg bffs forever I made you a scarf"" is apparently everything she needs to completely change her mind.The Queen Bee Mean Girl Bianca is a shallow cliche whose story goes nowhere and the romantic interests are bad enough to make anyone want to chose a life of solitude.CGI looks like it was made on a potato powered calculator by someone who proudly proclaims graphic design as their passion.The rest of the cast is so beyond forgettable and bad that there is no real reason to waste time on reviewing them.",1
North America,"Awful, Complete Disappointment. It was very difficult to continue watching. Childish waste of time! Cold & Empty. This show was really for poor me. Don't waste your time. Unwatchable. Very disappointing result sadly from one of my favorite directors. Cringe. TERRIBLE! Worst results I've witnessed. Wrong actress to play the role I'm sure someone else would have played it better I cant compare it to Christina Ricci' she was so much better and yet I see so many people overrating and exaggerating the actress whos playing the role, I feel like they have ruined one of my favorite TV families for me in this show, I would advice others not to watch it if they dont want the Adams family to be ruined for them.",1
North America,"The movie is not a copy paste of previous Addams Family movies if thats what you hope for. Despite people moaning about it, I think its a good thing! People are really narrow minded those days.. why would you even want to watch exactly the same story over and over again? Whats so bad about creating a different story? I found this series to be very entertaining and funny. I can totally relate to some of dialogues too lol. I'm on 3rd episode and so far so good. Haters will hate it becouse their little brains doesnt cope well with the changes. If you are oped minded you will definitely enjoy it. But if you want to watch Addams Family then go and watch Addams Family becouse this is not Addams Family....",8
North America,"The best part of the show is that you can start watching without a single knowledge of the Addams Family, the history itself doesn't work behind the original work. If you look into 'Wednesday' as a single history it might seem made for teens. After watching the whole season is easy to say that Jenna Ortega gave us an amazing Wednesday, the character that by herself uphold the Addams legacy.Tim Burton's view and direct made it so good to watch, even with the bad CGI monster, it doesn't bother to believe in the scene because the actors were being directed by Burton's amazing talent ne vision.Can't wait for season two!",10
North America,"I have been sickened by horrible remakes, reinventing classic characters of the past into convoluted into garbage coming to terms with their personal demons.THIS IS AMAZING!!! BEST REMAKE EVER!!!!!!!!Every character is perfect, the writing is fun. Every actor is spot on. EVERY CHARACTER IS GREAT.Catherine Zeta Jones is mind blowing good.I can watch it with my family. Everyone likes it. Kids who have no idea who the Addams Family is, parents who want something for everyone, Grandparents like me who remember the original series.They get it, it's fun. You will not be disappointed. We weren't.",9
North America,"Aside from some Questionable Casting Choices, I was looking forward to this show. Within 5 minutes I knew I had to throw out any preconcieved notions I may have had about the Addam's family and take this show on its own. None of that is why I have so many problems with this show.This feels like a poorly written cliche New Student at High School complete with Alternagirl being forcibly paired with the Preppy Blond, who gives her a tour of campus complete with ""These are the different cliques and this is what you should think about them, oh and there's the Evil Prom Queen. No one will ever beat her"" to Alternagirl bonds with guy from group she's told to stay away from. And an obvious set up for a love triangle.They might as well and written the script in crayons. The lines for these characters have al been heard before in ""Insert Random TEEN Drama Here"" and brings nothing to the table. They arent even utilized in any creative way.The concept and plot points make no sense. She is being sent to a school for Misfit Children who are different, but the school social dynamics and personalities are EXACTLY the same that have been presented at every High School Set Movie or TV show since Grease! Or even earlier. Outcadt in Name only. Everyone Magically Knows Fencing, Which Brings me to my next point of contention.Wednesday, the central Character (Duh) is presented as someone with a high knowledge base, high level of skill in Escape, Planning, Manipulation, Subterfuge, Fencing (?), Super-Negativity and Non-Conformity. But in her first Escape attempt she fails to consider that making a scene with the Kindergarten Quality Townie Bullies might work against her? That makes no sense. Wednesday's dynamic with her mother Morticia also makes no sense, NOR does the cringey Nick Name Gomez decides to give Morticia. No Itteration of Morticia would EVER deign to be called ""Tish"" WHAT?!Jenna Ortega fails to bring anything new to a character and instead simply copies Christina Ricci's take. Ricci's take was far scarier and leaned heavily on dead-pan delivery than the original TV show. Ortega just does more of the same. I suppose if you think someone can be Star Quality at singing Karaoke, you could enjoy her performance here.On top of my small personal Petty Complaints (The Gomez casting decision, that Kid from ""The Gifted"" who just grates my nerves) All of this together makes the show UNWATCHABLE!",1
North America,"First half - total snoozefest. Second half finally gets some action. I'm not sure who this was made for- 10 year old kids or grown ups? It seemed like neither. The characters - with the exception of Wendy Addams - are so beyond stereotypical that I wanted to vomit. Please!! Stop. Making. Characters. So. Stereotypical. Nobody enjoys this anymore.The storyline is incredibly predictable. It felt like I had seen this a million times before. At this point I am 100% convinced that Netflix has one writer locked up in a room somewhere and he writes all of their shows and movies under different names.The graphics at least look realistic. This was clearly a high budget production. Couldn't they find a few more dollars for a better writer at least?? If you're going to spend so much time and money on creating a Netflix series why wouldn't you want to make it good?? With a storyline this predictable you're basically saying ""We want this to be average AF and that's it"".If you're under 18 you might find this interesting. But if you're over 18 - don't waste your time.",5
North America,"Absolutely beautifully executed in every aspect of the imagination. The score is dark and brooding with strong sound direction and composed with purpose. The cinematography reminds one more of a film than a typical tv series but this is nothing new with the likes of GoT changing the landscape of what can be accomplished behind the camera of a television series. With near perfection in casting, I am sorry, I do agree with most here, Gomez was a mistake and seems to be driven by the choice in the cartoon films. But this is all forgotten with the mesmerizing role that Jenna Ortega performs. You would be forgiven and understood if you were planning on passing off as the latest Netflix dribble, but Wednesday breaks the mold of the last few years of release (of course we have Squid Games and a few other outliers, but for the most part Netflix has a negative net rating on quality of releases) and really delivers a strong story with enjoyable aspects for all different viewer groups. I am a 35 y/o male who typically watches independent films, thrillers or sports and I found this to so enjoyable we watched it twice over the long Thanksgiving Weekend off of work. I would truly recommend this to any and all. While understanding not everyone will love ""Wednesday"", I believe we have a new hit on our hand and can only hope future seasons take us on a deep dive into all things that this season created for us to love.",9
North America,"Honestly excpected this to be horrible like most rated 12 Netflix shows but it was great. Super interesting and a super twisted plot but many cliffhangers.. which is good for a movie and I was addicted and finished it all so fast . It is great and highly recommended. I'm not going to spoil it but the plot is like a rollercoaster and if you don't pay proper attention it won't make much sense. Upset that I've already finished it and I'd say it's family friendly. Might upset younger children though. Any
how I could watch this series forever and ever because it is just amazing and deserves its nominee. 100% recommended and one of my new favourite shows.",10
North America,"This is a bizarre bit of teen rubbish that is actually a fun romp. You just have to ignore the bad acting from many of the younger actors. The main characters do manage to pull off their characters well, but many always sound as if they are just reading their lines, punctuation marks included. Teen high school series are hot right now with every country in the world producing their own versions. This one goes a step further and adds the supernatural twist, but in a fun way. It's all a bit silly, but does keep you engaged despite the level of silliness being off the scale! There's not much to the story as the idea seems to be to move from one crisis to the next, complete with all the special effects available.",6
North America,"I wasn't expecting much from this series and only watched the first episode because of all the fanfare but I was in for a surprise treat.I'm an older person so this show is not pitched at me but I was hooked from the start.Firstly it looks fantastic . Very sleepy hollow.Jenna Ortega is a triumph.Her portrayal of Wednesday Adams is a joy to watch.I'd never seen her before and I'm sure we'll be seeing a lot more from her.The supporting cast is very clever .From Catherine Zeta Jones as Morticia to Christina Ricca as Marilyn Thornton, everyone pulls together
to make a really enjoyable watch .There will be a season 2 without doubt and I'll be watching.",9
North America,"I was glad to see that this show managed to overcome my skepticism. With Tim Burton this seemed like it should have been a perfect match of artist and muse, but the trailers had me concerned.I still find the casting of the majority of the Addams family as the biggest disservice to the series, but they play such brief supporting roles that it allowed Jenna Ortega to be the primary focus and do an excellent portrayal of an older Wednesday Addams.Thanks to the amount of screen time she was allotted, there was ample time to overcome the odd casting choices of the rest of the family. The writing was also exactly what I expected for the character, cold and sharply cutting quick-witted rebuttals that Ortega delivers with the emotional vacancy needed to fit the role.The overarching story is a simple ""who dun it?"" plot that limited the chances of being exposed to plot holes while serving as a vehicle to explore the expanded setting with.All new characters are pretty much high school tropes, even falling into nicknamed cliques and social circles based on what kind of spooky monsters they are, but thankfully Burton dialed back the teen drama that tends to ruin shows like Cobra Kai.I still can't get over the fact that Gomez looks like a meth dealer, and Morticia went from being agelessly regal to looking old and tired. Overall, it still succeeds in being entertaining and accomplishing what it wanted to, with enough plots lingering in the background for more seasons. Each episode had a lot going for it, making them feel longer than they were.",8
North America,"I had really been hoping to enjoy this more. An Addams family related property, in the hands of Tim Burton, how could it not be amazing?Well, unfortunately it was very underwhelming. Overall look is pretty good, actors are all pretty good, but the script was maybe...not what it could have been. Honestly not surprised I later found the writers also worked on Smallville, and the level of quasi teen/high school-ish drama is sort of understandable once I learned that. It doesn't make it great, it makes the character of Wednesday feel less like an Addams though and more like a teeny bopper detective.I would recommend trying it if you haven't, I was really wanting to like it more for the as already mentioned Addams family connection and Tim Burton in director's chair. I couldn't make it past the first episode, but don't let that discourage you. Even though it wasn't for me, it looks like it definitely is finding traction, so I'd say worth trying at least.Was really hoping to at least make it to that dance scene, that looked great on the YouTube clips.",5
North America,"Why? Why would you do this? Why would you take one of the most incredible cast of characters, one of the most thought-provoking set of relationships, and one of the most inspiring families in literature and film and turn it into a joke. Wednesday hating Pugsley? The Addams parents ignoring their kids? Morticia threatening her kid?Do Netflix writers read a Wikipedia synopsis of these shows and think, ""Oh, yea! I've got all the info i need to go ahead and slaughter this beloved gem now"" before they sit down at their desks? It's either that or they are incapable of understanding story telling, character building, and subtlety and just trudge through shelves of beloved stories and movies just assassinating every character they come across. It's infuriating to think that they do this for the sake of money. There's no WAY in hell that this show has an 8 from the general public. It just smells FISHY! And to think that one of my all time favourite directors was an accomplice to this debauchery is even a bigger insult, a nastier spit in the face.I could hardly get through one episode. Anyone who worked on this should be ashamed of themselves.Next time, write your own story before destroying beloved characters that have existed for years that you do not understand.The only reason i gave it 2 stars is because we still need space below the bar for true garbage like 365 days and the like.",2
North America,"Feels more like a spin-off of the show Grim with a detective trying to figure out which monster did it. Once in a while, Wednesday will be Wednesday but majority of the time she's just playing detective.I don't understand the fad with making Gomez Addams a Mexican. His first name is Gomez but his last name is Addams. That's like assuming a guy with the first name of Tony is Italian when his last name is O'Connor. Gomez's brother, Fester Addams and the rest of his family are not Mexican. Call it what you want but I'm just stating facts and I'm not the one that made a short-fat Mexican Gomez Addams in the animated film and this show about Wednesday that isn't actually Wednesday.",3
North America,Wasn't sure what to expect in the Wednesday series I was a fan of the original Addams family and the movie is that followed but this look pretty interesting especially that Tim Burton was the one who did this and I'm a big fan of nightmare before Christmas so I gave it a go and I really enjoyed it they picked the perfect girl to be Wednesday she nailed it I know a lot of people say that they didn't like who they picked to be Morticia and Gomez but I enjoyed them I really dug the plot how it flowed all the way through the whole series and of course I enjoyed they brought back one of my favorite punk bands from the '80s the cramps and their classic goo goo muck for the Ravens dance scene that was really cool looking for to season 2.,10
North America,"Full disclosure I gave up after episode 2:Tim Burton has completely missed the point of The Addams Family (unsurprisingly, given his last 15-20 years of output).Instead of a satire on the American nuclear family, this was a turgid, try-hard, humourless trudge through the most tedious mall-goth clichés.The whole thing is just absolutely charmless, despite honestly decent performances all round. No amount of capable acting and genuinely inspired casting can compensate for the dreadful dialogue and extremely overdone concept.If you're an adult, you'll only like this if you also like those witless slogan t-shirts that say stuff like ""normal people scare me"" or ""I'll stop wearing black when they invent a darker colour"". However, I can see how young teenagers would enjoy this, the same way that they would enjoy the aforementioned slogan t-shirts and base their personality around ""being a Slytherin""",2
North America,"To start let me aknowledge a fact about myself : I breath ""Tim Burton"" like nothing else in this world and I have an utterly strong and undying love for his art ! With that said I'm not saying that I adore every single thing that he creates because sometimes it's just not too Burtony for my taste BUT if I do adore it..I DO !Wednesday was exactly what I wanted it to be ! It's not a horror like all his works but it has horror elements! It's not a kids movie but it could be for the right kids and just like most his work it may look like that but that's the charm of his style - not enough to be labled as anything but a Tim Burgon movie !When I first saw the cast I was really happy to see Christina Ricci's name because if you know Burton you know his Love for Ricci and the fact that she was the previous Wednesday when she was a kid in the 90s Addams Family films so I was pretty happy that he took her onboard but I was not that happy with the choice of Morticia and Gomez at first because I think Eva Green and (especially )Oscar Isaac would be the perfect cast for this duo BUT now when I've seen the show I'm actually very happy with the Catherine Zeta and Luis Guzman as they do not appear in very episode and I would be really unsatisfied if Oscar Isaac was Gomes and he was seen only a few times Jenna Ortega was just outstanding! I first saw her in ""You"" and she instantly became a favorite of mine .She was P-E-R-F-E-C-T-I-O-N as Wednesday and that dance scene was just FIRE
I also REALLY liked the fact that we could still hear Danny Elfman's music and that they used a real man 's hand ( still attached to the man :D) for the role of Thing,when I first se Thing I was mesmerised by how real that hand looked like and I know that Tim Burton is a huge fan of stop motion animation so I thought that it was a doll but it ended up being a grown man creepjnv on the floor and acting as the Thing...which is just as cool as it can get ! The styling,costumes, make up I don't thing there is any need on talking about it everything was perfect as always and I truly cannot wait for more of this goth icon !!!",10
North America,Other than casting Gomez as a chubby sloth and turning Pugsley into a wimp. The show itself is pretty good. As I recall Gomez was into jumping on his trampoline as well as being an expert at fencing. Why turn him into an out of shape overweight person? In my opinion this is where the ball was dropped. Wednesday and Morticia's characters are well cast. Too bad about the other two misses. Pugsley and Gomez should have been casted better. Not really trying to take away from the actors that are portraying them. It is just that these two actors do not really fit the parts that they are playing. Sorry.,5
North America,"Don't watch this expecting a return of the old classic style or even anything like it.Sadly this is just a over done cheesy teen series.Obviously it's never going to match the old stuff but I was expecting this to at least be watchable and relatable to it.Gomez and Morticia are odd and not in a good way. Wednesday is overkill and pushed to the extreme of her character and everyone else is just cringe bad music and script maybe I don't know.Not a lot going for it other than the look of it they played too much to the ""teen"" thing it's horrendous.Thing is the only character that's awesome mainly because he doesn't say anything.",2
North America,"For the people who aren't versed in the universe of social media, you wouldn't really know that Wednesday is having the same effect on Gen Z as Stranger Things and Top Gun: Maverick, IT'S BLOWING UP EVERYWHERE! When I began to see the countless amounts of TikTok's of people dancing and imitating the mannerisms of Wednesday Addams, I knew I had to take the time to sit and watch the culture phenomenon for myself.I have seen some of the Addams Family movies in the past but they were never my things to be honest. With that being said, I didn't really have some idea of where this show was going to go. After taking 2 days to finish I can confidently say that I like what I have seen. Jenna Ortega's performance of Wednesday Addams was top tier. Watching her portray this dark and moody teenager in the beginning turn in to a less moody teenager that deep down cares about the people close in her life was truly special. Also watching a hand as a sassy sidekick was as entertaining as can be since he has no mouth. I give Wednesday an 8/10, good on the verge of something great.",8
North America,"In my opinion, the series is quite simple. The plot is too fast. A lot of events happen in one episode and it feels like a lot of things are cut out or not thought out, because there are a lot of moments when certain questions arise. The director was Tim Burton and I could feel his style. As I said, the series is quite simple in its own way, some moments are just banal, obvious and predictable. But despite this, the series is watchable in one breath. The setting and atmosphere just drew me into this series, the humor in the series in the style of the old ""Addams Family"" as it should be, and Jenna Ortega showed herself perfectly.",8
North America,"I was looking for something to watch that wasn't entirely reflective of the real world (too many cancer story plots making me sad).I was hooked on this show after the first episode. It's great. I really enjoyed being whisked away to this world . Jenna ortega (Wednesday) played the role flawlessly. Her acting and tone really set the scenes. The storyline is very interesting with a few twists and turns and keeps rolling with the the theme of ""who is it"".I enjoy Tim burton films in general and this felt like a longer tim burton films split into a series. The lighting and ""feel"" in the scenes just make me happy. Weirdly nostalgic to Tim's other work.Overall yes :)",8
North America,"I absolutely loved this. Jenna Ortega was unbelievable as Wednesday. Every part of her personality and facial expressions were on point and kept me watching. The dance scene was my absolute favourite and I'm not sure how she managed to keep a straight face when acting out that scene. The storyline was great with an unexpected twist. I love fantasy creatures so it added to my enjoyment. I enjoyed this so much I binge watched it over 5 evenings.I hope there is a season 2.I'm not sure if the right actor was chosen for Uncle Fester, it didn't sit quite right for me, but that's just being picky.",9
North America,"Principal Weems death was short sighted. Her scenes with Wednesday were riveting. G. Christie's' experience and magnetism fills the screen. There are no rules in the world of magic. If you can bring back GOT's John Snow, you can bring back Ms. Weems!Also, I am a big fan of Luis Guzman. Hats off to the creators for portraying the comic strip origins. The problem is the lack of chemistry between his Gomez and Morticia. Next season, if approved, I suggest you take advantage of his appearance. Make Gomez less soft. More take charge type. More dangerous. He can love his family, but you don't mess with him. He'll become more attractive that way. Remember James Cagney, and Humphrey Bogart? Not too pretty, but they had the ladies lined up!",10
North America,"I really, really loved the overall acting, colors...
I didn't expect this at all, like, this kind of story and mystery kind of genre... Netflix really did an amazing job!There is some funny scenes, made me laugh...
I finished this series in one day, I binged watched it and I just couldn't stop even tho I was tired...
I want season 2 asap hahahha
I like the way this series made us guess who might be the villain in the story, came up with a few but it's well made and it's tricky, you can't really be sure 100%...
I love a good mystery! ?
Love the overall vibe of this, I'd honestly give 10/10 and I'm really picky when it comes to series.",10
North America,"SEASON ONE REVIEWA series with Jenna Ortega as Wednesday Addams and directed by Tim Burton could be something spectacular, but personally it was not as spectacular as I expected.I wasn't sure where the series was going to go and it turned out that it was the typical teen show about teenagers solving mysteries, which has fed me up, these types of shows abound nowadays, I was wondering if Jenna Ortega and Tim Burton can save this show, and they did since everything I liked has to do with them.Jenna Ortega's performance is the best the series has to offer, it's not complex at all but she knows how to play Wednesday and without being expressive, it's seen that she enjoys the character, but the other characters.....the other Addamas are fine, no they shine a lot but they do it well, all the others without forgetting them and something clitches. Tim Burton's style is present, I love the settings among other things but the problem is that.... They do not shine at all, they do not have moments where these details are noticed and they simply remain as something in the background.The Addams are weird in each of their versions but in this one... they almost always just say they're weird but they almost never show it. I would have liked them not to show it anymore and that the Addams shine more than just Wednesday. As a last complaint, the cgi is terrible.Enjoyed the series, but was hoping for something slightly better.",6
North America,"As a fan of the 1990's Addams family films, I was a little apprehensive to watch this show but my daughter talked me into it and boy am I sure glad she did. Jenna Ortega is a brilliant Wednesday! Sure there were parts I compared to ""my"" version I grew up with, but I loved this take on Wednesday's story. (I hate that I have to type 600 words to tell you I really enjoyed this show.) I had read that Jenna Ortega took up fencing and piano, and even did her own choreography...which for the record, I absolutely loved. Really hoping we will get to see more! Oh and small spoiler....try to see if you can catch Wednesday blinking.",10
North America,"WEDNESDAY is not The Addams Family, so much so that I'm wondering if Tim Burton has ever seen the show, movies, or read the comic strip.The show is goth Harry Potter. Literally a complete Rowling ripoff:A young teenager with budding powers gets sent to a magical school for magical kids. They befriend the bumbling nerd and over-achieving girl. They discover they're the chosen one, destined to take down a leader of an evil cult that was believed to be defeated. The cruel professor has secretly been in love with one of the child's parents.The school is even separated into different groups who compete against each other and the protagonist gets recruited onto a team and is the reason they win.Zero Addams. Overflowing with Hogwarts.",5
North America,"This series has a few fatal flaws, but chief among them is the fact that this series is no different than any modern Netflix series aimed at teens: angsty unrealistic depictions of being a teenager, random bore romantic subplot, catty girl fights, etc. The fact that it's Wednesday Addams becomes background noise once the drama starts.Wednesday herself is depicted here like so many Aubrey Plaza wannabes, and has no real personality other than ""I'm a goth!"" Great.The worst of the worst however has to be the other main members of the Addams clan, Morticia and Gomez. In what is supposed to be a constant tongue-in-cheek flirtatious relationship is completely annihilated by the fact that Catherine Zeta-Jones wouldn't be in a romantic relationship with Luis Guzman, ever. My ability to suspend disbelief was impossible watching those 2 on screen.It's not just physical, either. Luis plays Gomez's dialogue...very strangely. Like a raspy whisper. I do not understand this choice. Any time those 2 are on screen I lose all interest in watching.The main storyline isn't compelling enough for me to stay. Yet another IP mined by Netflix for nostalgia yet they then completely ignore the nostalgic bits that made it popular in the first place. What's the point? There is none. Like this series.",2
North America,"Whilst performances and characters stay true, the story becomes transparent and predictable.Though it's undeniably fun, it was mismatched with gore and innocent sub-plots, as though it's target audience was unclear.With the classic family back on-screen over a series of episodes, the feeling of excitement was summoned and buried reasonably quickly after learning the storyline would last the entirety of the season, leaving many wasted opportunities and a thin plot.Delightfully dark sets, familiar family-favourites and ace acting; a perfect combination to resurrect the cultist-classics. Yet, the previous are all let down by lack of attention to detail, infecting a wearing story that loses it's theme quicker than zombies and limbs.Brilliant casting, though a spoiler in it was staring back through a foggy mirror.",6
North America,"So now, it's 2022, and a gorgeous... and I mean GORGEOUS... girl in black clothes... a Goth girl... she's walking down the hallways of a high school... and she's GORGEOUS, did I mention that?Okay, so this GORGEOUS girl in black clothes is walking down the hallway and the boys and girls all hate her, want nothing to do with her... Instead of every confident boy trying to get her attention as if their lives depended on it... you know, like REAL life...What Tim Burton doesn't realize is it's no longer the 1950's or early 1960's, and cute Goth chicks are commonplace...It would be far more realistic if a well-dressed kid roamed the campus and was hated for being so darn normal, average, mundane... Because Things have changed and Burton's still living in another world with the same kind of underdogs who are now the norm.... The outcasts are popular and have been basically since the 1990's...Aside from the premise of Wednesday Addams being shunned for... basically acting like a smug teenage girl (who is GORGEOUS by the way)... there's the inevitable attempt to wedge in her famous parental characters from the series and the movies, Morticia and Gomez, and yet both actors, CZ Jones and Luis Guzman, seem not only peripheral to the story, but have no connection with each other, and worse yet, their daughter...People are comparing this to Harry Potter, but being set in the special school full of young student monsters, from vampires to werewolves, it's more like Twilight with what should be a sense of ironical dark humor... which Tim Burton helped create decades ago...But WEDNESDAY has no real connection to the past of Tim Burton, the cult TV series or cult-mainstream films... feeling more an attempt to bank on a franchise that was different in the first place and, instead of giving it a darker, more edgy slant, it's actually become mainstream and, in this case, extremely bland.",1
North America,"The consensus is that this show is just great, but I am a contrarian here. I find the Wednesday character's deadpan and serious portrayal uninteresting, annoying and humorless. The expected Addams Family campiness and their winking and being in on the joke about their over-the-top gruesomeness is completely absent - except when the other family members themselves show up. The consistently strange thing is that the students at the school for outcasts who are werewolves, sirens, ghouls and the like seem more 'normal' and freaked out by the supernatural than the actual normal folks in the neighboring town. The overall writing and overarching story line is generally pretty good but I for the most part can't stand Wednesday's on-screen presence which kind of makes watching this show a chore rather than a pleasure for me.",4
North America,"As the title suggests this spin off from 'The Addams Family' is centred on daughter Wednesday. In the opening scenes Wednesday is expelled from school for releasing piranhas into the swimming pool... while it was in use. She is sent to Nevermore, the boarding school for outcasts that her parents attended. Even here she doesn't really fit in. Soon after she arrives she witnesses a monster kill one of the students; unfortunately nobody believes her so she decides to investigate herself. This leads to some trouble with the local sheriff who has history with her family. She must also contend with her developing psychic power and other students, including her perky werewolf roommate who is determined to be friends.I never watched the original TV version of 'The Addams Family', but enjoyed the 1990s films, so for me Christina Ricci is Wednesday Addams... at least she was until I watched this. Thankfully the makers took the character in a somewhat different direction; she is still morbid and dressed in black but this Wednesday is older, not as pale and rather than having a large forehead has a fringe that almost covers her eyes... This meant that it was very easy to accept somebody else in the role. Jenna Ortega does a really fine job; she really makes the character her own. The other characters are interesting and the cast is solid. The story provides laughs, thrills and some good scary moments. The various special effects, especially the monster, are really good. The central mystery develops nicely. This is nicely intertwined with various single episode plots. The main mystery is nicely wrapped up in a single season but the end clearly hints at an intention to make more... I certainly hope they do. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to older fans of 'The Addams Family'; scary scenes mean it is probably unsuitable for younger children.",9
North America,"I accept the fact that the other family members have like zero screen time. Okay so it's called Wednesday for a reason, however it would be more enjoyable if I saw the other characters a little more. A big reason for that is that Wednesday is completely unlikable and that's a big problem. What I loved about the previous Adam's movies is that The Addams Family Had each other's back. Wednesday hates her family and treats her friends like trash. Unfortunately it's not done in a charming way. I feel like they went too far with making Wednesday cold and they took away her substance. This is a huge flaw because you have to be able to like the character and care about them. I think that the show could improve if they realize this and make Wednesday more tolerable. No one can play Wednesday like Christina Ricci, however the actress did a good job. The problem lies within the writing, I actually hope for a season 2, but I hope they improve the actual problems because this could be a good show. Maybe give Wednesday a soul and make her a bit more charming. The Adams were always good people who enjoyed being different and I embrace that. In this one, no one has a personality and all the characters lack charm, especially Wednesday.",4
North America,"Can't actually believe how good this was! Had me hooked from the very start. The last few episodes were unbelievably well written and acted. Jenna Ortega is the absolute BOMB! Recently watched a movie called The Fallout starring Jenna and WOW she has you hooked from the very start!! Stunning young girl and unbelievably talented! My favorite up coming super star actor! Can't wait for the 2nd install of Wednesday! Like soooo excited! That's coming from a 32 year old man! Just think later and delve straight in to this watch and I can guarantee you will not be disappointed! A legendary family and era reborn! Truly brought back memories of the old days, watching The Adams Family! THE THING is so cool! Visually this adaptation is a masterpiece. At times reminded of how the movie - Sin City was shot/produced. Dark, eerie, visuals, with a hint of slash cut/genius! 10/10 watch! Jenna Ortega ????????????????????????",10
North America,When the fundamental characteristics of the main character are changed for no logical reason but the script bowls along seemingly oblivious to these changes then what other wise could have been a half decent product is ruined. I'm guessing this is supposed to be a comedy but I just didn't find it funny. The gags are very predictable and rolled out on cue. I wonder who the target audience is for this show. Maybe Harry Potter fans? The original series was a lot more entertaining in my opinion. This just feels like the ideas department at the movie studio were hitting a dry spot and so decided to try and cash in on something that was done well in its day but by trying to adapt it to a contemporary setting totally ruined it.,3
North America,"WEDNESDAYDirector: Alfred Gough and Milles Millar
Stars: Jenna Ortega, Gwendoline Christie, RiKi Lindhome, Jamie McShane, Hunter Doohan and Percy Hynes White
Genre: Comedy, Crime, Family, fantasy, Mystery
episode: 8 episodesI've really been looking forward to this series for a long time and that while this is my first contact with the addams family. I'm going to say right away that the character they've picked is really fantastic to make a spin-off about. Jenna Ortega plays really, really well and it's that I don't like horror that much, otherwise I would really like to see more of her in similar roles. At first the series reminded me a bit of Harry Potter and you can also compare it to that. That is where my first point of criticism comes in, and that is that it sometimes looks a bit too much like Harry Potter. Sometimes things have been taken literally and I thought that was a bit of a shame. I don't mean to say that I think the series is stolen, but it could have had a bit more of its own style (especially at the beginning), especially with regard to the school. The characters in the series are really, really nice. What I also really like about those characters is that they all have a little caracter arch. Not a very big one, just big enough in my opinion for a first season. What I also liked was that the Addams family also gets a little more backstory in the series. I will now go straight to my last point of criticism and that is that the series is perhaps a bit too much aimed at children. Yes, it is really very dark at times, but I would have preferred that the dialogue, for example, be a little less aimed at children. What I also want to say is that the soundtrack is really fantastic again. I definitely recommend watching this series. If I had to describe this series in short I would say that it is a nice spin-off with nice side characters but that is a bit too much aimed at children. There are some parts that gave me goosebumps. I'm mainly talking about the final episode.7.7/10.",8
North America,So I'm gonna start with that I had no high expectations going into this as Netflix is either a hit or miss.I don't remember the last time I did a review for a Netflix show probably Stranger Things and I felt that there was such a nostalgic but yet something very fresh about the show.Jenna Ortega played Wednesday Adams perfectly and I do think she brought a breath of fresh air to the show.I'm glad the focus was on Wednesday (Show named after her duh!) with little glimpses of her family. I do think this is a great debut to the Adams Family and I cant wait for season 2.This show is not for everyone but will certainly please people who like Mystery.,8
North America,"Aimed at 12 and up. Content might be to hard for some 12 years old.Another teen horror love whodunit series. (Not using romcom because it is too limiting)The horror, gothic thing is done nicely.The love portion was unnecessary.And whodunit was pretty obvious. It's the usual suspects and who doesn't fit with the rest question.What carried it mainly was Jenny's character portrayal,walking and spitting out one liners.She has a good hit ratio with her one liners, with the exception of her roomie the others haven't.It's questionable to have so many one liners though but again only some of them are duds.And Emma's bubbly personality, hopping and just being the friend who you would love to have.The score is done by Danny Elfman. While he delivers the same quality as you come to expect it becomes a bit much when you bingewatch the series.I thought I would see the hand of Tim Burton more but that was not the case.Episode length is great and the show most of the part moves at a good speed.There is not the overuse of obvious special effects so they would dominate the screen as say marvel or dc.I Don't know if I would watch a second series. This one was okay. Which to be honest is a surprise.Lately I have watched a lot of anime. Because of art style, storytelling and originality.This checked the same boxes.",6
North America,"Oh my goodness! Hands down, the best series this year and the best Netflix production in years!Where do I begin? With Jenna Ortega, of course. She first caught my eye in YOU. But you know how some actors are born for a certain role? Jenna was born to star as Wednesday Addams! Some people pointed out in their reviews that it is all about her - well, duh! Who else should it be about? I mean, do not get me wrong, the rest of the cast was pretty awesome, too! My favourites were Emma Myers as Enid and Percy as Xavier. And Christina Ricci as a guest star? Amazing! Also, Catherine Zeta-Jones was a good choice for Morticia.To sum it up, where Sabrina failed, Wednesday most certainly delivered. 10 out of 10.",10
North America,"The character of Wednesday is played by Jena Ortega, while Tim Burton, Gandja Monteiro, and James Marshall are the directors of the production. Wednesday is one of the best new shows on Netflix, but the streaming service's original productions may not be for everyone. She displays all of the character's peculiarities, coldness, and cruel comments, yet in such skilled hands, Wednesday is neither cartoonish nor one-dimensional, displaying remarkable depth instead. In this series, Tim Burton's penchant for morbid humour and passion for the macabre, as well as his love of Hammer Horror films, are on full display. Even the supporting cast is excellent, highlighted by Emma Myers as Enid, who is able to bring out the best in our heroine despite the fact that she is colourful. This programme is going to be right up your alley if you liked the last iteration of Wednesday Addams. This young actress has a promising career ahead of her in Hollywood, particularly due to the mesmerising performance she gave in the film.",10
North America,"Juat finished watching Wednesday series 1 , loved it absolutely brilliant , actors were great, story told very well and had my interest from the first few seconds
The last episode left me wanting more , so really hoping for series 2, The chosen cast were perfect for each and every role would also like to learn more about morticia and gomez tine at nevermore before Wednesday and what other problems Wednesday faced before hand.The director and production team made a brilliant job of the series and this is the first series I have ever watched from start to finish , can't wait for series 2 please.",10
North America,"Not a bad pass time.. though I would say the first episode is the strongest. Its bingeable and I like its style. Tbh I find it to be quite a strong copy of CAOS (chilling adventures of Sabrina) in cinematography, styling, aesthetics & some character plots. Though Sabrina was definitely better for seasons 1 & 2 b4 they ruined it no turning back season 3 sadly. So maybe this will last longer as even though not as strong a first series Netflix could ve trying to make up for the Damage they did to CAOS and hopefully will keep good writers on and not put anything out thats not ready or thought through Ortega acted well and totally carried her character... The Thing the Hand was the most loveable character/feature on the show. Tbf there wasnt anyone I didnt like. I will likely watch season 2 if they make one.",6
North America,"As a fan of the Addams I was really exited to watch the series, especially since it's highly recommended on the Internet.In my opinion, the show seems off. The main character, Wednesday, is just a bratty teenager that gives off the most cringey vibe. The second hand embarrassment that'll get from this show is real.The writing is just bad... It's full with teenage school drama that I don't really get and the word 'patriarchy' thrown around for wokeness points. The jokes aren't funny, nor witty, they are there to fill some pages and some screentime.I'm glad that there are people who really like the show, but for me it's just a parody of a reboot.",2
North America,"I have mixed feelings about Luis Guzman as Gomez, and Pugsly's character is weak and forgettable, but it's not about either of them. This is Wednesday! Jenna Ortega absolutely shines in this role. Her pithy, yet stoic quips are flawlessly executed (she almost never blinks). She embodies all the charm, and commands the respect you'd want out of that character. I can't think of anyone who could do it better. The supporting cast are all great, and even Thing plays an important, and entertaining, role. With Tim Burton at the helm, setting the tone as only he can, and fantastic plot and dialogue writing, this is one of the best shows I've watched in a while. It goes deeper into the Addams Family lore than ever before. It wraps up the story well, but leaves you wanting more. Fans of the old show, movies, or even just fans of spooky whodunnits will all appreciate this series.",10
North America,"Remember the Uma Thurman dance in Pulp Fiction? Maybe the ET jump in a byke with the moon behind? Or maybe that epic scene where Wednesday creates a reverse riot in a play of the summer camp in the old addams movies, that spice of classic feel, that we no longer have in any series or movie anymore, since the 90's, well, we thankfully got it here, we got many classic moments that made me love cinema and tv again, and wednesday, such A GREAT CHARACTER, it's so funny and perverse and vulnerable at the same time, that sarcasm is gold, the only 3 problems I found in this series is 1, Jenna is too attractive, sometimes it was hard to concentrate when I couldnt take my eyes off the actress, guilty!, 2, they miss the original addams song, this show needed it to become a real classic, and 3, the cinematography has the same flaws all modern productions have, excess of blue lights and orange/yellows at night, I guess it's like an industrial formula to make everything faster and cheaper, in the 90's we had beautiful cinematography in movies because they didn't abuse of blues and yellows, they really took their time to make of cinema an ART, saddly the cinema and series of the last 2 decades is too industrial and there's almost no artistic value anymore, which makes all productions cheaper and faster to make but with A HUGE DROP in photography quality :/ besides that everything else was better than I expected, so so good!",9
North America,"A bit disappointing, series is mediocre at best.The casting was a bit of a surprise, and thought greater consideration should have been given to certain characters. The chemistry between Catherine Zeta-Jones and Luis Guzman seemed to be lacking. The best performance was by Thing, as played by illusionist Victor Dorobantu (it was his first acting gig). Mr. Dorobantu should win an Golden Globe and Emmy for his role. Jenna Ortega also played out well, her performance also had award winning potential.Sheriff Galpin's character, played by Jamie. McShane, was great and wish his role had been larger.",5
North America,"Well, who would have thought, started looking like a teeny bopper flick... but what a turn of events, amazing, emotional, action packed, great backdrop from the Adams family. I cannot recommend this enough, what a great production.You can feel Tim Burtons influence, great cinematography, story line was epic, sexy, fun, we want to see more and cannot wait for more.The dark nature of Wednesdays character along with Gomez and Morticia and the brother .. and even thing ... uncle fester making an appearance, wife and I had a nostalgic experience.Christina Ricci ... original Wednesday Adams played a great role, along with the headmistress from GoT outstanding and looked beautiful.",10
North America,"This show was very entertaining and I finished it all in one sitting today. I love a good story between humans, or normies as they are called in the series, and supernatural beings. The twists in this series are quite well hidden, but with just a little bit of foreshadowing that if you pay close enough attention you can discover the mystery before it is unveiled to you. I think the series did a really good job at taking these characters from face value to adding dimension and character flaws that they could grow from in their character development sequences. This was quite the watch and I am hoping season two will measure up.",8
North America,"***Very minor spoilers***The beginning scene of episode one completely drew me in. I thought, cool this is going to be a fun series where we're treated to Wednesday's hijinx as she torments the students at a regular high school. But, that didn't happen. Instead she's shipped off to a school where she can try to ""fit in"" with other outcasts (vampires, werewolves, etc.). I was so disappointed, but I continued to watch... and I'm glad I did.What unraveled was a well written supernatural thriller/murder mystery. The acting, the writing, the plot, the cinematography, everything was top notch. The writers' attention to detail was very welcome, and their subtle (and sometimes overt) references to Addams Family lore was spot on. On top of that, Jenna Ortega's portrayal of Wednesday was just perfect.Of course, there were some small quibbles. Minor plot holes, questionable dialog here and there, and some forgettable teen angst that detracted from the viewing experience. But overall, this was very enjoyable and I would heartily recommend it.",8
North America,"I ejoyed very much the series. Whenever there was a close up on Wednesday face, looking so serious I thought how could she stay so serious the entire scene. She probebly stop for a laugh and come back with the poker face on.I liked it that Wednesday evolve through the episodes. I think she learns that some of her assumptions on the world and the human being were wrong. The last scene when Enid huged Wednesday and she first gave her a 'what the hell are you doing' look and the she huged Enid back, that was a very touching moment, That's the moment when you see the ""human"" side in Wednesday. I hope that Netflix is planing on 2nd season.",9
North America,"I truly wanted to like this series, but it just fell right in line with other teen shows that try too hard to have a mix of supernatural and outcasts. The dialogue felt so forced and awkward half the time, and the other half I was just put off by the acting.I can't say it is terrible because I've seen far worse, but it really is a let down. Now, maybe that's partially me clinging to the nostalgia of old Addams Family shows/movies, but in all honestly I barely remember them, and what I do remember is that Wednesday wasn't this pitiful. If you have absolutely nothing else, sure, throw it on and decide for yourself, but otherwise, spare yourself from this painfully underwhelming show.",3
North America,"A great job by the director and a very good performance by the actress Jenna Ortega, bringing something fresh to the utopian series, such as the new actor hand in hand, very well achieved, giving it humanity. He has been able to narrate the script very well and has a very good staging. With so many movies and series in the world, it's hard to find something that brings a new spark, and this series is one of them. Jenna Ortega has a great future as an actress due to her good performance in this series, the gothic with the terror is a good cocktail that is valid for all audiences, since the bad also takes.",10
North America,Tim Burton absolutely crushed this. Jenna Ortega was born to play Wednesday Addams. The storyline is also very good. I was so shocked by how great this show was. Also-the little references and hat tips to the previous Addams Family and Wednesday just makes you smile.I was very skeptical starting but it is seriously so good. I would say my only complaint is the actor they chose for Gomez... not the Gomez Morticia deserves in my opinion. Other than that this is a total home run. If you haven't watched please do yourself a favor and binge this show.Please god let season 2 be just as good!!!!!!!!,9
North America,"So i just finished watching the latest adams family adaptation, Wednesday. Admittedly, i never really got into the old movies or other adaptations (except for the animated series when i was a kid), but being a long time tim burton fan( which hasn't always been easy), this version intrigued me. My thoughts on the series are.......mixed. Some good, some bad, overall complicated. Jenna Ortega was definitely the stand out, and she acted circles around the rest of the cast. Burtons signature gothic style is all over the screen, and having him work again with danny elfman was definitely a welcome addition for any burton fan. This is easily the best product hes put out in years, which unfortunately isn't saying much since his last few projects have been, just, bad. The story, while being filled with cliches, was certainly enjoyable and kept my interest even through some of the things I didn't like, enough to make me wanna see what was gonna happen next and how it was all gonne end. I'd even say some of the comedy was well done and had some very smartly written joke. However, the show definitely has some flaws. Some of the characters were just straight up annoying, and their performances definitely didn't help. I know the whole adams family thing is ""quirky"", but some characters were definitely trying to hard. Also, like i said earlier, there were so many clichés and cringy lines that it made it a little hard to get through at times. Some of the cgi was just bad, like 90s cereal commercial bad. Also, i found the climax to be a little, well, anticlimactic. Though there was one twist i genuinely didn't see coming, the rest of it was pretty predictable. Overall i cant say this is a bad show, and i would be interested in a season 2, but it's not particularly great either. So, I'd give it an ok.",5
North America,"Jenna Ortega is wonderful as Wednesday. The rest of the cast is great too for the most part. The sets are visually very appealing. And yet, with all that, the series is a disappointment with the lacklustre writing.The first few episodes showed some potential, and the underlying murder mystery plot seems like a good premise at first. However, as the season progresses, each episode is more disappointing than the previous, culminating with a season finale that is not only anti-climactic, but leaves you wondering what the writers and directors were thinking.So much potential wasted. Fred Armisen plays... Fred Armisen. The dialogue turns into something out of Riverdale. The unique appeal of the Addams family as a critique of society by turning social norms inside out is replaced with a Harry Potter clone.Watch only if you enjoy being disappointed like your parents were with you.",6
North America,"To me the acting, clothes and so on... were perfect!Except for some things. Everyone seems to adore her with no clear explanation, all the people are nice except for Wednesday! What I mean is: The idea of only Wednesday being a realistic character while the others are totally unrealistic is very contradictory. What kind of personalities in the characters the serie wants to portray? Realistic or unrealistic? The idea of ""just her"" being the problem does not feel real... Because the majority of people are not merciful.Xavier loves her so devotedly at first sight and went to jail because of her wrong suspicions. I do think that even thought he loves her, he should set limits. People who are cheated from their partners separates but still love them. Same thing should occur with Wednesday! The story transmits the false belief that we can do whatever we want with people who loves us. Even if the belief is true, where is the sense of morality in the serie? The story should teach good things not bad deeds! Mainly because their target audience are children!About the critics that said she is a very rude character, not funny or sympathetic. The intention of the serie is not to show an incredibely positive main character but yes a realistic one who seeks revenge, with some quirky traits (like not accepting hugs if the person is not a close friend)... that is constantly learning through her own mistakes but like I said before I do think the other characters should be more realistic.",9
North America,"Everyone all over the internet seems to absolutely love the new Netflix show Wednesday. It has incredibly positive reviews and it is currently trending on TikTok with people dressing up as the titular character and dancing to the choreography of the now iconic dance scene (although for some reason on a speed up version of Bloody Mary by Lady Gaga, rather than the original song??? I really do not understand the internet).All of this leaves me baffled and confused, like as if I have watched a completely different show than everybody else. The show, in my opinion, is just not very good. Or better, it's just really bad.From the butchering of the main themes of the original Addams family, to the ridiculous storyline, the predictable writing, the cringy dialogue, the acting (exception made for Jenna Ortega's Wednesday, which literally carries the show), the dull love triangle, the teenage drama, I could go on forever.But let's tackle this one issue at a time.Let's start by talking about the original Addams family. The whole point of the Addams family was to satirize and completely invert the trope of the perfect ideal American family. To do so, the original comic book (and the subsequent 60s tv show and 90s films) sets this family of ""outcasts"" (as the show likes to call them), where everyone dresses in black, is pale, has fascination for the macabre, and simply doesn't care about what society thinks or expect of them, in the most normal place you could think of: the suburbs. And that is where the strength of the original saga comes from: this contrast between the seemingly perfect American family, where everyone is preoccupied with their appearance and how society perceives them, hiding how secretly unhappy they are, and this grim loving family where between torture and grave digging, everyone is happy and loves and cares for one another.The Wednesday show however decided to take a different route, by placing the titular character away from her family, in a special school for outcasts. However, by placing Wednesday in a school full of werewolves, vampires, sirens, and other cliché monsters from ""The Monster Mash"", she just loses her spark. Are we really supposed to believe that literal monsters are scared and weirded out by a regular girl who dresses in black, doesn't blink often and sometimes plays the cello? For this reason, and since I guess the original sociopath with murdering tendencies was too boring for Tim Burton, the writing team decided to give her a superpower: the ability to randomly see the future when she least expects it, just like in the much better ""That's so Raven"" (good job Mr. Burton!).Changing the setting however wasn't enough for them, so they decided to insert some drama in the family, to spice things up: a secret murder backstory for the beloved Gomez and Morticia, who lack any trace of chemistry (unrelated but I had to point it out), and by adding an unnecessary conflict between Wednesday and her mother. And for what concerns the last point, I have seen many people defending it by saying ""she's a teenager, every teenager has conflict with their parents at that age. It's perfectly normal family dynamics"". But that is exactly where the problem is: the Addam's family, by definition, is the opposite of normal, so this classic teenage drama and rebelliousness doesn't really fit the character.But let's move on to the storyline, shall we?To keep it simple, Wednesday gets sent by her parents to this school of outcasts, where a monster is on the loose, killing both students and normies (that's how the show refers to regular people). Among this chaos, Wednesday has a vision of impending doom, having to turn herself into a hero and investigate in order to save the school, while dealing with school drama and a love triangle, where she has to choose between a boring and plain white guy that vaguely looks like Evan Peters, and another boring and plain white guy that also vaguely looks like Evan Peters, but with slightly longer hair (Oh boy, can't wait to see who she ends up choosing). All of this is accompanied by some of the cringiest dialogues I have ever witnessed, gifting us with lines such as:""Wow, you're in black and white... Like a living Instagram filter""
""When I look at you, the following emojis come to mind. Rope. Shovel. Hole.""
""You're just kind of kooky"" ""I prefer spooky"".The plot is extremely predictable, including its numerous alleged twists, and it culminates in an extremely silly battle that looks as if it came out straight from a Disney channel original movie, with a zombie pilgrim from the 1600 who vouched to burn all outcasts, who uses his magic staff to try to burn the school down. Wait, but if he can use magic, doesn't that make him and outcast too? Also in the flashback he didn't really use magic, or am I wrong? And what was the point of reanimating him anyways? I don't know and I simply don't get it.One more thing and then I swear I'll be done. This is more of a pet peeve of mine, so it's not really a big deal, but it still really bothers me. Thanks to Wednesday's vision, the show introduces us to an Addams family's ancestor from 400 years ago: Goody Addams (yes, I agree, it's a really silly name). The whole witch thing and vision powers is implied to come from Morticia's side of the family, which is also the main reason of the conflict between the two. It's Morticia the only other person in the family that has visions. It's Morticia that gives Wednesday additional information on this ancestor. It's Morticia that gives her the magic amulet that later, with the help of Goody, will save Wednesday's life.But Morticia's last name is not Addams, it's Frump. So I guess she got the witch power from both her mom and her dad? Couldn't they simply make her an ancestor from the mother side, to fit the storyline that they wrote more? Also, I find it hard to believe that they managed to maintain the same family name for 400 years. Especially, considering that Goody is a woman, and we live in a patriarchal society were we take our father's name. Did the writers thought that if they gave her different last name, or no last name at all and just called her Goody to make it simpler, the audience would have been too stupid to understand that they were related? Even though the character in the flashback is played by the same actress? I know it's a stupid hill to die on, but it really bothers me.That said, the show manages to not be a complete disaster simply because of Jenna Ortega's performance, who as I said before, literally carried the show. She really managed to portrait a more mature and emotional version of the character without losing the essence. And considering the script she was given, she did an absolutely phenomenal work, especially in the dance scene, which was truly iconic. Thanks to her, and her alone, a show that would have been completely unwatchable, turned into mediocre but easy to binge series, raising the rating from 2/10 to a 4.5/10. So, koodos to her.P. S. Having a subplot about a girl failing to turn into a werewolf and therefore failing her parents expectations, who want to send her to a conversion camp, implying a clear parallelism with being gay in a conservative family, to later have her suddenly and randomly turn into a werewolf just for the thrill of a final battler is kind of shitty.",4
North America,"HURRY UP & GIVE US SEASONS 2-5!!! I loved it. I have never been interested in the Addams Family enough to watch the original series or the movies. But this looked intriguing. At first, i was afraid that Wednesday's monotone demeanor & seemingly better-than-everyone-at-anything abilities was going to quickly get old & obnoxious. But then you keep getting to see little bits of different emotions, & doubts, & failures, & vulnerabilities. Just enough to keep me liking her more & more as it goes on. I was hooked. Jenna Ortega & Tim Burton made her (& the rest of the story) a lot deeper & more addictive than i expected, and i am craving more.PLEASE don't let this be another show that Netflix cancels for no good reason. Keep it going. And while you're at it, also bring back Dark Crystal.",9
North America,"I really liked the show, (it was amazing) but it seems like to extend the show, we were given multiple mysteries.Like the parent's mystery. That doesn't really affect the main plot accept for making the sheriff slightly nicer.I would love to see more like this from Tim Burton and from Jenna Ortega.Also with the coming of this show, maybe we will get to see a Netflix glow up. It is safe to say that Netflix hasn't been amazing lately.Solid 9/10This message is filling up space. This message is filling up space. This message is filling up space. This message is the final one taking up space.",9
North America,"What a perfect and contemporary take on the Adam's Family. First, the casting is inspired and looks closest to the original cartoon, but also honors the classic 60's show and the 90's movies. One of the 90s actresses, Christina Ricci stars as one of the many eccentric characters that inhabit this beautifully dark world Tim Burton creates for us. The asthetic scenery coupled with the location and costume design makes watching this show a treat. Every detail meticulously crafted to better the story and our own enjoyment. Ortega, who plays Wednesday is excellent. She takes what others have done before and really hone in and round out the characters potential. But she doesn't have to do it alone. As our mystery progressis the show is full of great actors bringing their A game to every outcast, classic character, or new hire. This is much watch. Burton at his best...",9
North America,"I remember watching and appreciating The Adams Family with Christina Ricci as a kid. No, I haven't seen the original and don't care about the comparisons. Anyway, I went into this one with no expectations and was not disappointed. There were good references, but the writer, director, and cast made this their own story and did a phenomenal job. It sucked me right in with the incredible cast and characters along with the murder mystery. Definitely some twists and turns to keep you on your toes. Plenty of dark humor, and great dialogue. I really enjoyed seeing the growth in some of the characters as well. I flew through the season faster than expected. Suffice it to say Wednesday kept my attention. Can't wait for more seasons!",10
