Show,Review,Rating
The Witcher,"I did not know that this series was based on books or a game. I watched the trailer and felt it was something I would enjoy watching. After watching the 1st episode I knew it was going to be good and it just got better and better...My only gripe is that until you have watched the 4th or 5th episode do you realise that you are watching 2 storylines The Witchers Past and Future...and then they finally collide into the present. Binge watch it's well worth it., Can't wait for Season 2",9
The Witcher,"I see a lot of terrible reviews because people have no clue what is going on with the weird timelines and ""poor dialogue"". If you actually have the time to read the first two books i highly suggest you read them BEFORE you watch the show. I enjoyed it fully, it was exactly how i imagined it while reading the stories and I believe they did a great job to stay as faithful as they could to the plot. My only remarks would be the fact that dorregaray was not included ( I loved him as a character but it would've added more poor reviews because people that haven't read the books would be even more confused with so many characters appearing out of the blue) and that eyck of densle was clearly not the virtuous strong knight that I remembered. 10/10 nontheless I doubt anyone could've done it better! Can't wait for next season!",10
The Witcher,"The show is very good and adapts well to the books and game, people are just haters when they brought up GoT. Just enjoy the show and have fun with it.",10
The Witcher,"They talking, talking, walking, talking, talking, walking, talking, talking, talking, walking, talking...Who did this lame color grading? Students of second grade of moviemaking University? Did they used HitFilm Express to render this boring stuff? Bad chroma key on the green screen, guys. Booo.",1
The Witcher,"So much random backstory, so much jumping back and forth and I didn't understand what was what... Some parts of the show I still don't understand why was put there or when it was in the timeline, other than that the show is really good. Cavill fits perfectly. I'm certain I will enjoy season 2 much more, now we have the backbone of the story.",1
The Witcher,"Loving it, managed to watch 5 hours worth without even realising.If you liked GoT then give this a watch (it's much better).",10
The Witcher,Not quite sure if I watched the same show as everyone else as I found this to be a real let down. Casting was terrible and if what I read about the production costs are true then it goes to show the higher ups at Netflix have mo money than sense. Could not make it to episode 2. You're supposed to be interested in a show within the first 15/20 minutes but it failed after I forced myself to get through the entire first episode so unless ep 1 is some kind of faux pas I hope the true rating for this show will come down well south of 7/10 where it deserves to be.,2
The Witcher,"While I have only watched the first 3 episodes I feel I can already judge the quality of this TV adaptation of The Witcher.That being said, I believe its beyond ridiculous to rate this show 10/10 as so many have.I have played and completed each of the game titles several times and read the books and their respective short stories. I feel quite comfortable with a 7 and that is really the best this show deserves.I feel you can not compare to game of thrones, nor to Lord of the rings, The hobbit, Harry Potter or Fantastic Beasts and where to find them or any fantasy titles. This story and show is its own and the games did the story the most justice, or rather CD Project Reds telling of it.My first gripe and this was when it was announced, was the cast. I was sceptical at best about Henry Caville as Gerald, but honestly he has surprised me and does a solid job. Many of the other actors cast do not in my honest opinion fit the vision of the games but more so even the idea given in the books...I wont go into much detail here because I am sure many will call me a snob and I can live with the cast easily enough as its really the smallest issue at the end of the day.The show however has a ""cheap"" or rather limited budget feel, while this may or not be the case, the series ends up showing that its by far not the budget of Lord of the rings or any of the names I listed above, still not horrible and they get the effect and vibe mostly down well enough.I am a bit concerned about the timeline of it all, while as far as I have watched the 3 primary stories are that of Gerald, Yennefer and Cirilla (which was mostly true) I feel there is a problem with continuity (at least as far as the 3rd episode goes)Yennefer was established and renowned at the time Nilfgard attacked Cintra and yet we see her only becoming who we know her as when we ""meet"" het the first time in the books or can derive from the games (third game specifically).If there is a disconnect and there is a timeline difference I did not see any sign of it, though I was looking for it. If anything Yennefer is too young (back to first gripe of the casting choices) and yet should meet Gerald soon based alone on what is going on with Cirilla.Cirilla even knew Gerald as a younger child, though this part was left out of the show, which I feel could have been useful as another episode and incorporate more of what and who Gerald is and his relationship to Ciri.So definitely some holes in the story I am not happy about but sure, its TV so I should let it slide...I can go into much more detail and strike up a debate but in a nutshell its not bad, its worth watching and it is so far not too far off the beaten path though does not feel as grand or epic as the impressions I got from the games which simply were fantastic.I will watch the entire series and see how it goes, give all the actors a fair chance to show what they can do, but as far as ratings goes, this is at best a 7 and not at all anything more, which is still more than I can say from many adaptations that came from a game e.g. tomb raider movies",7
The Witcher,"I've not played the game nor read the books but I feel like this is one if the best dark series I've seen for a long time. Okay so cgi is not the best, neither acting nor plot, but it's hard to come by much better these days. I really do like the settings and cinematography, they lend their aesthetics to something resembling very much what it tries to be, a mythic, adventurous almost horror slash gore fantasy, and it does so beautifully.I understand how reviews are conflicted, I can see that people do rank this out of fandom for sure. I guess it's just one of those either you like it or not. I kinda liked it, it's definitely not GoT but then again it never tried to be.",7
The Witcher,"Apparently a lot, as this is nowhere near the quality of GOT....I'm not a fan boy of anything, but this is formulaic from the first episode.
I tried following, but I have no idea what's going on. There's a princess, but she was evil, but she wasn't, so he killed her, so he's a bad man...while another little princess screams alot and runs away. Did that battle happen realtime to the Witcher or in the past?Pass.",3
The Witcher,"I'm starting to think creators are reviewing their own shows. It's a good series so far, and I would normally rate Witcher at a 7 or 8. I'm just concerned that it's getting awfully close to GOT in ratings which is a complete farce.",6
The Witcher,"The inconsistency of the quality of each scene in both lighting, picture, acting and dialogue are out of this world. This immediately takes the serie down to a 5 star. The shallow and immature directing of the story deducts another star. This could have been an excellent show, sadly. The fighting scenes are brutal and entertaining, which I found to be the only good aspect of the serie.",4
The Witcher,"First episode through the third was pretty good, must admit. It got me hooked. Dialogue was decent, and Cavill is doing good. Other actors were fine and showing qualities and fighting was well executed. Long takes showing the actual stunts.But the further I got (have seen five episodes), the more it felt like Vampire Diaries trying to be Game of Thrones. Dialogue got worse and worse, and while the fighting choreography was impressive, there were some reeeeally corny moments like Duny and Pavetta flying like Shrek and Fiona, not to mention Geralt's justification to saving Yennefer from the Djinn. ""She saved you, I can't let her die!"".It's very clear how the show tries to make Geralt an emotionless character, but at the same time have already established that he's very friendly. This makes for incredibly predictable content.It tries to be this dark show, but fails. Waaaay to light, which contrasts badly with all the blood and gore. The atmosphere just doesn't fit.I was very excited for the show, but after five episodes I feel like I'm very ready to drop it. It's just too corny and perhaps fit teenagers better.",6
The Witcher,Thia show is very good. Only at the second épisode but already hooked. Can't stop Watching.,10
The Witcher,"I was really surprised by the 9.3 rating of this title when i first saw it here. I went and watched the first episode excited for something awesome. And man was I disappointed! It is really really cheap series with below average acting and the worst story ever.
It was like the story was written by a 16 year-old. Boobies, blood, unrealistic fight scene, fire and magic. All this at random. I don't even fans of the game would really like it.",5
The Witcher,"I've binge watched all the 8 first season episodes and I can honestly say this is a fantasy world which works well. Right from the get go the use of magic and monsters is revealed so there is no slow, drawn out reveal as there was say with Game of Thrones. Geralt is an excellent anti-hero as is Yennefer. I would say the mood and style of this series is somewhere in between the Shannara Chronicles and Game of Thrones but do not mistake this to mean that it is of the same quality as the Shannara Chronicles; the Shannara Chronicles was a pretty rubbish series and got a well deserved cancelled season 3 (the young actors were just not up to it). The Witcher has great acting right across the board and special FX are up there. Highly recommended to fans of the fantasy genre; do not believe the mainstream media reviews which are giving it 3/5 stars, this is a sold 4/5 stars to 9/10 stars tv series.",9
The Witcher,This show is everything I wanted from a solid show after playing the games. The sound score and many other aspects resemble the games which make it pleasing to watch. Amazing,10
The Witcher,"I hope there is ""much more"" to come of this series! The cast is amazing and who doesn't love a superb hero?",10
The Witcher,Good and enjoyable to watch! The series brings top level of story telling! And excellent acting,10
The Witcher,"I just love it, I don't understand why people compare it to GoT...It's really different type of story and flow.The only reason I didn't rate this show a perfect 10 is because it made for ppl who know a little background of the story, if I wouldn't knew about it I guess I would be confused about the story in the first episodes...",9
The Witcher,"First of all, I was very doubtful when Henry first got the role, and I was thinking ""Really? Superman?"" But how wrong I was that the performance from Henry is outstanding and I can feel that he is Geralt.I have read the first novel and played the Witcher 3. The Witcher 3 is such a masterpiece that immediately after finishing the game, the emotion I felt was something I've never felt before, felt like losing a lifelong friend. But the show hasn't delivered that, partly I think it's based on the novel which consists of different short stories rather than one consistent story. I think the writer should take more time building the characters and give more time for characters to interact with each other (many things are missing from the novel and even if it's not on the novel, I think It's worthwhile to let the characters interact and build emotion with each other). Because a lot of the scenes, the characters are just full on emotions without blending into it and sometimes it just feels like staged (not sure if it's because of the writing or the acting).I really hope season 2 can take more time to build the characters and please take more time for audience to think and look at the lesser evil and greater evil choices, not just full on, throw it out there like it's script.",9
The Witcher,"1) there are no questions to the main Cavill character, the best in this series
2) is it exactly a Slavic fairy tale? I did not remove my hand from the facespalm
3) why are there so many other race of people in the series? it's too much, you oversaturation made it look tight and cheap
4) Why in the tavern we hear a song not medieval but some modern jazz, who invented it and why? for this it is necessary to dismiss
5)The eyes of all the actors are oversaturated with artificiality, but these are lenses, but why should they be so highlighted with contrast
6) ridiculous moments with naked girls, I am not against female nature but it should be in certain scenes, as it was in games of thrones
7) this is not the witcher, this is beverly hills 90210
8) and I'll ask you again why you had a bunch of people of non-Slovenian appearance, this is a Polish fairy tale",2
The Witcher,"I'm baffled.. I think most of the bad reviews are from people who have never played the game or read the book or just anybody who holds GoT on a little too high of a pedestal. Very entertaining s1 looking forward how they can bult upon this ,*edit* i don't get why people are making this a "" my show vs your show type thing..( got vs this.) Just enjoy",9
The Witcher,"I watched the entire season and I have to say I am enjoying this series quite a lot! It has a few problems ofcourse like every show has; especially the cgi is horrible, the creatures look so fake it takes me out of the action, but this is something that can me remedied with a higher budget (wich I expect it will get if this season is a succes)
Besides that a few corny scenes here and there, and sometimes the acting is a little weak. But overall the story and world is interesting, you feel the creators have a passion for it. Super curious how this show will evolve!",8
The Witcher,"First of all, I have neither read the books nor watched the original Polish tv series. I also have to admit that, learning of Henry Cavill's casting, I didn't approach the show with high expectations (although, admittedly, with the secret hope of wanting to be wrong).Unfortunately, sadly I wasn't.Comparisons with GoT aside (which I haven't watched so far), the show is simply...Quite bad, honestly.Apparently, it's been filmed entirely for male teenagers. Blood, gore, sex out of nowhere, dialogue, plot, action and everything else so blunt and in-your-face that anyone capable of intelligent thought should feel insulted to be treated like their IQ was somewhere around Forrest Gump's. The worst instances are the a-second-or-two moments of slow motion after a sword strike to emphasize that *ooh-hoo, it has hit its target, whoa!*The show might be close to the source material. Fans might like it.Anyone else, though? You might as well watch a Michael Emmerich or Michael Bay movie. You can be sure it'll be about as intellectually stimulating as this show.",2
The Witcher,I love it can't wait for season 2 i loved the acting how they make the story mixed between the past and future loved it,10
The Witcher,"Honestly, my title says it all. ;)But Cavill - well, fact is, when I first heard he had gotten role, I was like.. ""Err.. Superman? He's frickin HUGE and Geralt is more of a slender guy (lightning fast swordsman), and you just don't picture huge guys as .. well, fast.Thing is, he went after the role. He'd played the game a lot (and it really is one of the best video games ever made) and you can tell he loves the story.His accent is PERFECT. Even early in the first episode and he just responds with a kind ""hmm"" from the back of his throat, it was ...dare I say it again? Perfect. ;) I laughed out loud though. It was funny in delivery and in epitomizing the character.From what I've seen of the previews, they've done a great job on sticking close enough to the books (and since they were originally in Polish, enough folks will still be pleasantly surprised by the twists and turns) that it should please most fans as well.Beyond all that though, the fantasy (and production) values are top notch, though there are a couple of times when I felt the camera felt a little.. I don't know what the word is. Small screen? I don't know, it's hard to describe. Doesn't matter though b/c the sets and CGI, and the characters are well acted and I loved the fact that I didn't recognize a lot of them. Sometimes, it's hard to really immerse yourself in a story when you recognize every last person and you can just imagine that they are on a set somewhere and there's guys with cameras about a few feet away from the people you watching.Well, not here! With Cavill, the makeup and voice changing he does, and his whole demeanor is nothing like you've ever seen him him. The supporting cast is fantastic as well.If you want a comparison, this is to the Witcher universe what the LoTR movies were to Tolkien's work. It's that good, and that's the production that it should be compared to.",10
The Witcher,"I don't care about the negative comments. They are always salty people around, writing their cheap critics, BUT I knew this series going to Booooommmm ;) and So its did!!!!! Many compering The Witcher to GOT.... Well to you guys better ""Back off"" its two different world.. but anyway I loved Got characters,and still the end was bitter and felt like a big disappointing... The Witcher deserve that attension and I m so glad to see every episode! So for me its a MASTERPIECE!I can't wait for the next season ;)",10
The Witcher,"In term of quality of acting and writing, The Witcher its on the level of The Shannara Chronicle, but with more money and Henry Cavill.",6
The Witcher,"In what world Fringilla and Triss is a black person. It is hard to understand. I am not a racist person but witcher lore has no black character as i know(just played 3 games,havent read book). There is so much unnecesery and meaningless sex and nude scenes. But it is just netflix things i guess.",7
The Witcher,"I'm surprised this is being rated so highly on IMDb, the show is watchable but has some serious issues. The quality is Very inconsistent where you have certain scenes really well done in terms of lighting and cinematography and others look unfinished and done amaturely. Acting can be good in some scenes and horribly awkward in others. The dialogue strong in some scenes and suddenly changes into something out of a teenage high school drama. Some dialogue choices are extremely poor And awkward I cannot emphasise this more, also Henry Cavill does a poor job delivering the F word everything he's in trouble feels so out of places. You suddenly hear out of place cringe dialogue that kicks you out of the immersion. The characters also don't have any unique personality since their character personality are all over the place without being consistentThe accents keep changing from Old English to modern to American to Irish to whatever, actors unable to keep a consistent accent. Casting is also inconsistent where Henry seems to be a good choice but many other characters for example Triss is portrayed by a horribly looking actress who looks like she is a crazed homeless hippy, Triss is actually an extremely beautiful red haired sorceress. In some scenes Yennefer is extremely beautiful as she should be and in others her makeup, clothing m and lighting is so off she looks like she looks nasty, in some scenes Henry Cavill looks rugged, bad ass and awesome and in others you can clearly see the fake wig and cheap looking costume, again very inconsistent quality of work. The soundtrack in some cases is well done but in many fails to capture the Slavic Dark medieval themes of the Witcher.There also seems to be a lot and a lot of scenes with dancing in the courts like a lot of it! The creators seem to think that's something that needs to be shown a lotThe writing and story is poor but watchable. It's very unfortunate that this series was given to a team of writers and creators who have no interest and no background with the Witcher, I think Henry ""likes"" the games but that's not enough. A team who really cared would have insured every little detail of this show is done to perfection, Look at the quality done by HBO with GOT and anything they touch. Witcher has potential to be the best and most watched show Netflix ever had",5
The Witcher,"Anyone who says this is a ""perfect"", ""flawless"", or ""amazing"", does a disservice to this because it is a plain exaggeration. What that creates, and what I was sorely tempted to do, was to score the series at a one star to balance the scales. So, if you love something, don't exaggerate because it will inevitably muddy the waters. Just try and explain why you like it, even though it is more work. ??The cg in the first sequence is far from perfect, not to say anything about the pacing of the fight. HC's acting is wooden, and out of synch with the tone. It is like he is not sure if he is supposed to be doing it straight, or if they are sending up fantasy films of today. Or, just does not respect the material/take it seriously. I would say this also applies to many of the performances in this series.The script is full of dialogue that feels like it was crafted by a tenth grade drama class. Full of anachronisms. Worse than GOT in that regard.Gratuitous nudity, check. I'm not judging nudity, just how effectively it was used. I would say poorly, but certainly was present and not suble.The look of The Witcher is not consistent either, often changing visual tones in a jarring way when cutting between exteriors, interiors, and the cgi designs.If you are willing to overlook these elements, The Witcher has the potential to offer some long-term, big storytelling possibilities.",5
The Witcher,"It's an amazing show, great scenery, fighting, perfect casting and pacing. It follows the books pretty much with occasional homages to the games. Henry Cavill is perfect in the role and the others shine also.",10
The Witcher,"I think it's a very good season 1. For those who claim GOT was amazing, go back and re watch GOT season 1 it feels like a cheap soap opera.People who hate the script or Cavils acting I think they're both spot on and probably captures the essence of the witcher.Too many people giving it 1 star to counter the young lads who probably counter the haters. Way too convoluted. Was planning to give it an 8 but it deserves a 9 just because some of the people here are just plain salty with their 1 stars.Also OK boomers you've watched original star wars in a theatre (someone did argue this lol)",9
The Witcher,"I only watch because of Henry.C.This was really bad done, like the last of GOT it was that bad.
Som part was good like the monsters, except the dragon that was really really bad done. I like the witch castle.
The war was really bad and the militära strategy in the first episode was so bad.
The first fighting scene in the village was good.
Mosty wrong akters play the different part in the serie.
No mysterium around the witches and warlocks.
The same as ELFs, so boring. They look like humans and act like them.
No connection to anybody.
Better let HBO do it..",5
The Witcher,"I Loved the books,
I Loved the games,
And i Loved this... :$",10
The Witcher,"First, good opening scene but having to wait 50mins to see the Witcher in action was hard work.
The creators failed to capture the spirit of the Witcher series. Cardboard cutout acting and a very contrived storyline doesn't help. The dialogue is so bad I found myself skipping ahead scenes because they were predictable anyway.
In my humble opinion the TV adaptation pales in comparison to the PS4 game. If only it got close to the game trailer it could have been great but see and decide for yourself.",4

I don't know any thing about the Witcher coming in and I feel a lot of the ratings are coming from people that has a prior knowledge of the series.However I'd like to point out from a fresh perspective this story lacks a lot of visual explanations that need to adhere to people like me.I need to understand what a Witcher even is and i feel this show has failed to explain that in the beginning.This show deserves a narrative. This is a fantasy show. Understand the genre.Henry has a strong voice and dam I'd totally be okay if he just narrated the whole dam thing hahaha. Felt like they missed that opportunity :/I feel there is a lot of lazy filler parts that are very Unnecessary. This show could be cut in half the time.",6
The Witcher,A mishmash of everything that went right that obviously went wrong.,8
The Witcher,I'm sorry but i don't wanna see rethinking about Twilight saga>.<Good music.In fact music that's all what was unconditionally good.Dialogues -trash.sure. McGregor may make it in better way/,2
The Witcher,"I have no idea why lead males are all doing Jonny Cash whispering impersonations nowadays. It's almost as if it's a necessity in the ""playing the cool"" hero. It's got potential. I just wish that Henry Cavill didn't sound like he was about to break into ""I was born under a wandering star"".",8
The Witcher,"While not being a fanboy and not having read the book of this fantasy, i really liked the acting especially by Cavill and storytelling (ignoring very few cliches).
Wasn't hoping much but made me watch the whole season after ep1. That's a win in my book.
Also got to know the backstory of my favourite game characters.",9
The Witcher,"Well, after first 4 episodes I nearly fell asleep. The only thing that has kept me awake was that I had to figure out the timeline. I was so disappointed, of course comparing it to the entire GOT, that I wanted to give up. Yet, hell it's Friday so why not to see how it ends. To my surprise the plot has taken off and the film has started to be interesting and more or less all plots came together in episode 5.I guess if it was made prior GOT, I would have been ecstatic about it. Unfortunately, GOT has put the bar super high (w/o the last season).I presume, those who have not read the book will struggle to understand what is going on but if you manage to the end of episode 5, you may like it, like it a lot. Shame for the writers to make it so convoluted at the beginning and cause the fans some pain.Would give a 9 if not the slow and confusing start. Trust the second season will be better.",8
The Witcher,"The show is great. I finished it all in one sitting and didn't get bored or tired at all, which tells a lot about how captivating it is. I won't bore you with why it's so good, just know that it's brilliant. However, my only concerns are mainly the timeline was very confusing, I don't know if it was just be being dumb but I found the flashbacks confusing. Also, the score was pretty lackluster and didn't really hype you up as much as other shows have, and finally there were some VERY VERY cringy scenes, although they weren't common at all but when they did happen oh goodness I wanted to peel my own skin off it was very cringy",8
The Witcher,"So far this show is very intriguing. The sword play is amazing, the magic uses just the right amount, good practical effects as well as special effects.",10
The Witcher,"I didn't have high expectations going into this as I'm usually not impressed by many Netflix shows and films. But gotta admit I'm blown away by this! In my opinion the show is really amazing. I expected nothing and went in with an open mind, and I'm glad i did because i was really amazed!Henry Cavill as Geralt of Rivia is no brainer at this point. The man has so much love for this character and this show! He catches the essense of Geralt, his dry humor, his neutral good personality, and how he is so tired of the hatered.Unpopular opinion; I also like the diversity. Its fu**ing beautiful
Imma give it a 10/10 as it is probably my new favourite show",10
The Witcher,"Briefly and clearly, I didn't expect the show to be this cool. I'm a big fan of the video game series about Geralt. I am incredibly excited about the quality of the show, the best computer graphics I've seen, and how well Henry Cavill has fit into the role. I thank Lauren Schmidt and everyone who worked on this incredible series.",10
The Witcher,"Also if you have the attention span of a squirrel don't watch it because most of it will go over your head. From someone who loved the books and games, watch this show you won't regret it!",7
The Witcher,"I love the soundtrack, casting, fight scenes and Henry Cavill + Anya Chalotra were brilliant! I hope this gets more seasons! I'm going to read the books again.",10
The Witcher,"Had huge exceptions for the show, and it is everything i hoped, and so much more. This has to be one of the most epic first seasons of all time in history. I hope they continue the same way in the upcoming seasons.10/10",10
The Witcher,"Many have been bashing the characters of the series. But in all honesty, we are not yet at the critical phase of the story. Season 1 is just an introduction. As most of the important details will be revealed once Geralt finally meet Ciri and the ""WILD HUNT"", the 7-footer elves from other dimension that keeps chasing Ciri. Also, the importance and the role of other characters to the main story. Yennefer, Triss, Shani, Dandelion (Jaskier), Zoltan, Radovid, Eredin, and the other cast. And most importantly, Geralt meeting Avallac'h.You know its a good film if you're fan of the book and the game, and the Witcher Netflix adaptation captivates your attention. In my opinion, this is the best prologue for a game-series adaptation.",10
The Witcher,"It is a first season of a very complex universe. It requires a build up and the first season did well. Remember that it is adapting TWO books of short stories, so it's A LOT to go through in 1 season, and they didn't even adapt all short stories.Saying that, I think they did a good job of telling the chosen stories. Much of what needed to be said was said, and didn't feel rushed or confusing.Showing events from different times was good! If they didn't to that, Ciri wouldn't even be present in first season, only at the very end! Yennefer backstory was nicely done too.
Somethings did feel fast, the moment I felt it the most was at ""the end of the world"" story, much was cut, but it's ok...
The acting was good. Calanthe, Geralt, Yennefer, Jaskier and Ciri were very good.
The show started very bloody, a bit more than needed for TV, but the books are graphical as it was showed, so ok.
The monsters can get better, BUT don't be worried, it's good enough.
REMEMBER: the source material is excellent and it is a high cost series. When I say it's ok, it means it was well adapted, and very good compared to other series.",9
The Witcher,"This season is not a 10/10. It is a 7.5/10.I gave it this rating because i really want this to succeed. The actor for Geralt nails the character and is the main force of these series. Unfortunately it is being carried down by stubit decisions that make the whole sorcery and plot look stubit. However there are other scenes were i feel that this series is extremely good. Some scenes are intense for the sake of being intense. I feel that if the focused more on the key story points and gave more focus to the monster hunt and skiped some ciri and yennefer part that felt mostly like fillers the show would have been mutch better. Some of the things that happen out of the blue feel cringy like that Geralt and Yen kiss in the dragon cave. It could have been mutch better excecuted but not by the actors. Actors in general i feel are really good. The way they handled the plot is what bugs me. Sometimes it feels serious and sometimes it feels stubit. The material is there for this to work and as a massive fan of tw3 i really want this to be the best it can be. What i am happy about is the actor's detication to being Geralt Ciri is good and Yen as well. The problem are the cringy plot twists that turn out to be stubit and not something wow. I feel if they give us more action with geralt and focus on the monsters from the games, give more swordfights like the 1st episode the show will be mutch better. Actors are not the problem though.",10
The Witcher,"First of all.... everybody who rates 10/10... what do you rate, let's say, shawshank redemption or the godfather?Witcher is a very good series, if you compare it to all the crap, that marvel has puked the last couple of years.
But if we stick to loosely the same genre and compare it to game of thrones and Vikings... shouldn't even be mentioned in same sentence as Game of thrones. Vikings... njae... witcher is better than the latter half of the series at least.Henry cavill saves it very much, and it helps when you think that it's based on a game. Otherwise a bit messy and some things looks a bit cheap and overplayed. But, as mentioned, it's based on a videogame.Worth the time! Hope's up for improvement.*English is not my first language.",7
The Witcher,"This series is kinda weird and clueless. It's a half-baked script, started from somewhere but definitely not the beginning. It seems this series is a sequel to something else. Lot of things seem to have already happened long time ago, this series simply disregard the prequel and started in the middle or somewhere in the later, but definitely not from the beginning. The script sucks big time, with bad acting, pretentious and clueless dialog. Look more like a play on a stage instead a completely developed screenplay for a completely well-told storyline.I also noticed that readers of this novel series complained similarly. The whole drama series just looked too elementary superfluous. The soundtrack seems to try too hard to mimic ""Harry Porter"" or similar genre craps too much to tell the difference. Editing also sucks big time. The whole drama series just made me feel too British but not open and wide enough to be accepted internationally. The whole story just felt forcefully patched up in haste, just as incomplete as the storyline, segment by segment, glued together roughly.I've tried my best to watch to the 3rd episode, but decided not to go on further. This is a terrible series hyped with heavily promoted ads by Netflix, but in fact, it's a clusterfxxk, a 300 lbs rotten pumpkin! I have to quit right now. This is the biggest disappointment in year end of 2019. What a joke!",1
The Witcher,"Roach best actor no doubt!Masterpiece, as a witcher fan i was worried they would mess up but ohh boy im the happiest man alive rn, cant wait for s2, i might need a potion to wait that long...",10
The Witcher,"Whoever wrote the credits must not have watched the series. They said that Marilka is in one episode; I'm watching Episode 2, and she's in it.Regardless, this is an excellent fantasy tale. Between The Lord of The Rings, Game of Thrones, and The Witcher, can the 21st century be the century of the fantasy film?",9
The Witcher,"Well, they did an interesting take on the story: instead of following the books too closely (gosh, the first book is a collection of short stories without Ciri and Yen, would be enough for two seasons without getting to the main story arc) they decided to give us an introduction to the main characters, the main story line and the world - a lot for 8 hours.
Some episodes feel a little rushed, some stories are fleshed out more than in the books (Yen's story).
Overall not as dark and cynic as the books (where the monsters are usually not the monsters), but I'm very eager for the next seasons.",8
The Witcher,"So amazing, the cast the songs everything is perfect i can't wait for the second season...many thanks to present us such as this masterpiece.",10
The Witcher,Thr theme and song were wonderful but the acting was rate 9,10
The Witcher,"This is the first time I've felt compelled to write any kind of review on any movies or tv show I've ever watched. I've never watched a show so true to the source material I love, incredible.",10
The Witcher,"I tried, then tried again, but it's so boring. The story is lame, the characters are not interesting. Very difficult to watch",2
The Witcher,"Like Macklemore would have said... ""THIS IS AWESOME!""",10
The Witcher,"Generally I would say it's a good show. I was pleasantly surprised anyway.After playing all the games and reading all the books, I was worried about watching this show.The script was generally good.The casting was alright.The acting was uh. Well. Some of the actors were amazing. Some were... Less so.The CGI, was very mixed. Some of it looked good. But for instance, the Sylvan? It looked like someone wearing a very big mask.The contact lenses were slightly distracting mostly because they made Henry look cross eyed quite often.The music was good. Not as good as the video games' scores (third one is my fave), but good.I feel sorry for the people who has not read the books, since the it's probably very confusing for them with the timelines. Considering that there's three of them and they randomly mix them up.I was entertained for sure, and I'll definitely watch season 2.Honestly, from episode two and on I just wanted to wrap Yennefer in bubble wrap and protect her at all costs.
I like that they gave her her own timeline. I might be a bit biased, for I have always been team Yen.Other than that, Henry was brilliant, but really so was Roach.
I liked that they let Henry cast Roach. Roach 4-ever!!",8
The Witcher,First of all i just played both 2. and 3. games didnt read any book i will read tho. I must say that this series 10/10 i love every charecter. Some cast maybe wrong Especially dark elves :(. There is none dark elves in this universe. Also Triss not described as is in the book. Henry really live with Geralt. I can see the Geralt from game. Also back stories is awesome. Last episode kinda boring tho. But other than that dont compare this with GOT its all diferrent plot geez. If you love fantastic genre or even you dont just watch this whole new universe you wont regret it.,10
The Witcher,"First of all, I usually lay off commenting on other people's reviews, but enough is enough. You have people here rating this a 10/10 and calling it a masterpiece.
If this is what you consider a masterpiece then I feel sorry for your limited experience.
And stop try to compare one show with another, a review is supposed to be about the show you are reviewing, not a comparison.I knew nothing about The Witcher going in, having never read the books nor played the games, which I usually consider a bonus since there are no expectations to subvert.Henry Cavill does an excellent job, however the writing of the show was just not that great, and the special effects were not up to par.
I binged all 8 episodes and found myself fairly bored during the first 2 episodes, and had I rated this show on just those 2 episodes my rating would have been a possible 4 or so.The non linear story was interesting if at times confusing but kudos for making something different. The pacing however was such that I just wanted them to get on with it already.The effects were not well done at all, especially the sorry looking dragons, and even though I had never read the books or played the games, I saw the surprise twist almost immediately.Watch it if you like, but you will probably forget it in a few weeks.
Hopefully season 2 will be better.",7
The Witcher,"In my humble opinion the games were better than the books, so I was disappointed to learn that this series will not be adapting the games. Otherwise, I was entertained enough to finish the series. So many places it can be improved though. Henry = awesome but that literally is it. Needs more umpff.",8
The Witcher,If you are looking for coherent story you wont5find it here. if you are looking for coherent character development you won't find it here. If you are looking for anything deep or meaningful you will not find it here. If you are looking for a fantasy story told in a fashion aimilar to a Michael Bay film you will find that here.,1
The Witcher,"I usually don't write reviews but I felt the need to do so, so I could save people a couple of hours watching this (budget, badly written, horribly acted, terrible CGI) Joke of a TV show.
For the ones who want to try, watch the first episode if u liked it, then go on. If not, then u need to stop there, because that's basically it until the last episode.",1
The Witcher,"First things First. This will inevitably be compared to GoT. This isn't thrones. It doesn't have quite the same budget. As such it suffers occasionally from dips in writing quality and doesn't have quite as strong a cast overall.
But, it doesn't feel cheap and tacky. The lesser budget has been used well and given a chance, I can see this growing into something special.The Witcher is a strange beast however. To the un initiated, I imagine it being a little tough to get into at first. It is packed with strange rituals, unusual behaviour and weird characters. It's use of disjointed chronology, definitely seems to have thrown some viewers too.All that being said, at its heart is a pretty action packed and often nicely choreographed, mind bending, bit of swords and sorcerery, without straying into D&D geek territory (No offence to dungeons fans). 4 episodes in, I'm really enjoying it so far.It's worth noting I've not read the books. so I don't know how it compares, but I have played the games. If you are a fan of the games, you'll love all the little nods to the digital version, even if you don't recognise the story or some of the characters. It also includes baths!!!I really wasn't sold on Cavill as Geralt at first. But he has won me over, with his gruff, grunting portrayal and occasional humour. Likewise a lot of the main supporting characters, while nothing like their CG counterparts, are all solid and fall into place after a few episodes.Don't go in expecting multimillion dollar ""battle of the bast*rds"" level of spectacle, and you might really grow to like this odd animal.Edit: having watched further on. There are some issues. Each episode is directed by a different person or team. The difference in skill and experience between some of these directors is sometimes glaringly obvious. Compare the first episode, with its gritty atmosphere, solid acting and well choreographed fights, to, say, the later Dragon episode, with its average CG, terrible choreography and overall feel of an episode of Xena warrior Princess from the 90s. It's a real shame these episodes weren't spotted and refined, because they drag the show down unfairly. There are also clearly some young actors cutting their teeth on this series who need a lot more direction. Without a guiding hand their inexperience really shows and their scenes suffer. I hope this gets a second season and I hope Netflix have the good sense to up the budget, and lose some of weaker directors and actors.",7
The Witcher,"It's good enough entertainment, expectations seems a little but too high here.
This is not the next GoT, it's some degrees below in terms of scale and overall quality.
Everything is okaishy. The story is good but may seem rushed and fast paced, the fight scenes are good, the acting is average, the settings are beautiful but don't get explored and the characterization is kinda odd with everything looking too much clean, everybody wears clean cloth and makeup, the ambients don't look like people actually live there. Also, there are no transitions, you are always jumping from one stage to another, it looks like they had little space for the records and used a lot of CGI to render the scenarios. This last point is very important because it sets the tone when it comes to medieval stuff, there is never a big scenario with lots of elements and actors, it always seems like the scenes are recorded on a small stage and it's limited enough so that you never see them going to one room to another without a cut - there are too many cuts here.
Sometimes you get the feeling that this in a cheap show and the direction really sucks, it's often misleading at times.
There is too much drama for irrelevant characters, you really develop no feelings for them. They are there and you are not interested in their story, it feels like filling after filling.Overall it's a good show, not bad, but don't fool yourselves to think is the next big thing. There is clearly a gap in budget between this and GoT.Netflix should balance better between marketing budget and production budget. It could have been much better but it ends being a mediocre-good show. Nothing special but not bad either.",6
The Witcher,"First off wow... Henry Cavill did an amazing job portarying Geralt. I was definitely unsure at first but after hearing countless times how invested he was in the character and finally seeing his performance I would've have chosen anybody else! As far as the wig and contact complaints go I never even noticed a problem with either of those through my viewing, only saw reviews with people complaining about them...Sat through all eight episodes with only 3 breaks to use the restroom and it was worth the leg cramps without question. The story wasn't perfect at times but everytime it felt like it was starting to drop there was some wild/unexpected turn to pick it back up again.My only real complaints would have to be the lack of clarifying the timelines in the show... I found myself a few times being unaware that they were in a ""flashback"" of sorts several times because there's ZERO on screen prompts to inform the viewer that they decided to take a u-turn to before the events of the first episode... I would see characters that have already died and be a bit confused as to how they came back until I caught on they were backtracking. Also, I understand they weren't going to adapt it from the games but a few more ""monster hunts"" or just more Geralt in general would've been nice as the whole Nilfgaard plotline felt a bit hollow at times.Overall they did an excellent job with the first season and I can't wait to see where it picks up at when the second season comes out! Just wish it wasn't a full year away :(",8
The Witcher,"This a series Is daffrant level from game of thrones and
In Of wizard things in any series you will be inside those actors",10
The Witcher,This is Game of Thrones meets Lord of the Rings. Great role for Henry Cavill. I've long waited this show and it was worth the wait.,10
The Witcher,"I was surprised at what a great job they did getting into the world of the witcher. I've read some of the books, and played the video games. It was smart of the show producers and writers to not try to reproduce the game. It has some elements of the games, but to me the show has more of the feel and spirit of the original witcher stories. Just finished episode one, and looking forward to seeing the next.",8
The Witcher,"Big let down..
All over the map and not worth the time.
I serial watched hoping it would improve... It never did",3
The Witcher,"Not even Vikings or Spartacus. It is more like Xena: Warrior Princess or Hercules: The Legendary Journeys, that I loved to watch in my early teens, but much worse on so many levels that I won't even start. Though if you're teenager, you might like it more than me.",1
The Witcher,"Finally.
After three episodes.
Oh man finally !!!!
After four episodes ....oh my goodness finally !!
The only thing created by men what can be compare to the Game of Thrones. Or we can compare Game of Thrones The Witcher...
Because The Witcher is a new King.
Henry Cavill is perfect. He is tall he is big he is wide and he is fast. And he looks like a mutant ??
The whole universe created around him is very realistic. Magically realistic.
Everything is a world of magic.
You can smell it. You can touch it.
Very realistic fights.
I hope you will continue this for a years .",10
The Witcher,"This is a GREAT show and has amazing potential.
The only gripe I really have is some time line jumping that I didn't really even know was happening and was thinking wow, some of these actors look like other actors, but they were the same characters in different time lines.
Putting a little banner on the screen with the date would have fixed that (in my opinion).
But all in all, I really enjoyed it.. looking forward to season 2!",9
The Witcher,"It has some issues with lore, but I did have good time watching it. For someone who hasn't read the books, story telling might seem confusing with time lines. But it will explains in episodes 7-8.",10
The Witcher,"This is far beyond expectations ... the fight scenes are so perfect, like no other show ... this is how sword fightings should look like. great characters, great music. just enjoy this masterpiece ladies and gentlemen",1
The Witcher,"I am a huge Witcher fan, after viewing the first two episodes i must say i am impressed, the acting is great, Cavil certainly fits the role. The fight scenes are awesome they go all out with the gore. Can't wait to see what this show has in stall.",10
The Witcher,"Well everyone is so like hateful this days that hating rather than appreciating something has become easier! Don't know why that's easier than anything....! Well the series ain't that bad at all! I feel there is so much content from the books, games etc that finding a middle ground for the series is freaky! But For crying out ITS Great! I Need More and More!!",10
The Witcher,This is far more than I expected. Great fighting scenes. Perfect music. Awesome characters. This is just great. Amazing job doing this,10
The Witcher,"I've never played the Witcher PC games, but I'm a big fan of the books.
In the beginning of the first episode I was a bit... meh.. it was slightly dark and confusing and I wasn't sure what was going on. But by the end I was thoroughly enraptured.The scenes are beautifully haunting, dark and gritty which makes the juxtaposition of certain illusion scenes all the more fantastic. The CGI monsters are quite literally, spectacular and not overused.I'm not 100% sold on every actor choice as representative of the characters I have imagined in my mind for the last decade... but lets face it thats nigh on impossible to fulfill and more than likely after a few more episodes theirs are the faces I'll see when I close my eyes, as they are seriously pretty darn close.In the current state of amazing TV actors we are exposed to, for something with this large a budget, my expectations are HIGH. and the acting for the most part is seriously on par and in some cases exceeding my expectations.The story... well this is where for me it is very interesting. I can't speak for fans of the PC games who have never read the books.. but if you are a fan of the books (and you read them in the correct order ie. by date of publication) you will definitely appreciate the way they have gone about telling this version. They have taken aspects of the short stories themselves and the vast time spans between the stories and woven it all into a cohesive tale, just like the books did. Sometimes presenting stories from the distant past for you to now connect the dots to the events in the ""current"". AND I can't emphasize how much I am enjoying this style of story telling as it really does make me feel like I'm experiencing the books all over again. With additional parts of the story which were only ever hinted at, in the books (eg. Yennifer's back story)As for the fight choreography. For some context, I'm a lifelong martial artist somewhere in the range of 35 years, with a fair bit of iaido\kendo experience in there. So I feel like I'm in a good position to call BS when necessary. But I'm also of the mind that a certain suspension of disbelief is sometimes necessary to enjoy stuff... *cough* *cough* GoT... Starwars lightsabers.
With that out of the way.. let me just say.. the what can only be described as the sword fighting clinic on display at the end of the first episode not only surpassed EPIC, it was so smooth and well done, that I didn't even need my suspension of disbelief glasses on. That plus I felt the need to watch that scene 3 times in a row it was so beautifully choreographed.Long story short.. is it perfect??? I think thats an impossible task given that it is competing with an image thats been in my head for a decade and they are playing around with some very beloved characters. But WOW, they got it amazingly close and absolutely nailed the cinematography and story telling aspects. And to be honest.. given enough time, whats in my head will most likely morph to match anyway.SO big thank you to Henry Cavill and the rest of the cast for bringing Geralt and all their respective characters to life, and another big thank you to Netflix for taking a chance and giving this beloved story the love and attention to detail it deserves.",9
The Witcher,Im once again blown away by the many iterations of the witcher. This being yet another,10
The Witcher,Seen almost two episodes and it's a big letdown. Never saw the Thrones show or read these books but there are too many story lines going to keep me interested. The Witcher character gets about 10 minutes per episode and the rest is filled with stories to keep young girls and interested.,6
The Witcher,"As an avid fan of the books and games, I am pleased with the series overall, but there are a few things that really bugged me.
First, the positives: Henry Cavill nailed the role of Geralt, from everything like his stony countenance to his gritty voice. Furthermore, the fighting sequences were overall very well executed. You really feel the simultaneous tenseness and fluidity that are Geralt's movements. I also really enjoyed the chemistry between him and Yennefer, although I would have really liked them to have featured the ""Shard of Ice"" short story at some point in one of the episodes, especially since Istredd has such a prominent role throughout the rest of the season.
Now for the not so positive. Firstly, the entire character of Fringilla was completely butchered. One: She's white, not black. I get that Netflix feels the need to portray themselves as PC in every one of their originals now, which is whatever, but the fact that they intentionally altered the character's skin color for such means rather than staying true to the books is just silly. On the note of not staying true to the books, Fringilla's spot in Aedirn wasn't taken by Yennefer but rather she has always been a Nilfgaardian sorceress, a key element of the novels. Furthermore, I just don't like her character at all in the show. They really vilified her making her out to be a stark POS in my opinion, when there are already so many other characters that could have been portrayed from that angle. Another example is Cahir. Yes, he is initially illustrated as one of the bad guys in the novels, however, the show takes it to another extent with the actor's nefarious smirks and seemingly pure mal intent. I sincerely hope that this changes as the show progresses, although it will be very difficult to empathize for Cahir now that they have painted him in such a dark light. My final complaint is with the use of sorcery in this first season. The mages are painted out to be some of the strongest figures in the novels, such as Vilgefortz who, in the show, loses in a sword fight with Cahir? Here's an idea: maybe, like, use some of that untethered powerful magic? I get that any fantasy work requires a certain suspension of disbelief, but come on. This just felt like the writers didn't do their research.
There are many other deviations from the original novels that I will not get into for sake of time and my understanding of the fact that the writers had to give the first season a sense of chronology and overarching story in lieu of the collection of short stories that Sapkowski intended with his first two works. Nonetheless, I hope they can work on some of these things for the seasons to come.",8
The Witcher,"This show is badass. I played all the games and it lives up to those which were great. Henry Cavill is perfect as the Witcher, and the effects and story are awesome. Watch it!",9
The Witcher,"Timelines are too messy with no clear distinction
Off-putting character inaccuracies
Felt like Witcher had lesser screen-time in his own show than other characters
2/8 episodes were above average quality",6
The Witcher,"As a fan of complex and convoluted story-telling, I am very disappointed in what and how they managed to show in this 1st season.
But first, the good. I never thought I'd say this, but Cavill!!! He really makes a great Geralt! It's obvious he played the games and nailed the dry humor and sarcastic looks, even the voice. He really carries the whole show.
The fight scenes are very good, the cinematography is excellent and the sets, costumes and music really bring the world alive in a beautiful way.
However, here's the bad news: the story is chaotic, with a weird pacing and it just lacks the spark!
They chose to present separate plot lines in parallel to bring them together towards the end, which is fine, but the chronological order is extremely chaotic and hard to follow even for someone who already knows the story and the universe. They don't set a basic timeline, don't say when and where the action is happening, even if it jumps back and forth 30-40 years into the past or future from one scene to another.
By the end of episode 4 (half the season)none of the major character's had met each other or have done so very briefly, they hadn't explained what Witchers are, how they came to be, they through expressions like ""conjunction of spheres"", elder language/blood, but none of it is explained. They just somehow assume we know it already! Yes, the ones that read the books/played the games, sure. but the rest? They'd get super confused.
And honestly, the whole thing lacks something to make it immersing and engaging. I know the universe is huge, there are many books and stories to choose from, but I think if they tried to cram less into 8 episodes and make everything more clear and easily digestible, it would've been much more powerful.
Also, without spoiling it, the whole explanation for why sorceresses can't conceive is just stupid ans an excuse for a shocking scene. And no, I am not squimish and I don't mind the gore, just the unnecessary one. The second part of the scene, in parallel with the other fight, though, made a very powerful sequence which I liked a lot.
All in all better than expected in some aspects, failed to deliver in others, but overall overwhelming in a bad way for newcomers to the universe.",7
The Witcher,"We only made it 20 minutes into the first episode when my wife declared ""I'm going to bed, this is stupid and boring"". I agreed, and now we're both in bed. Netflix is obviously paying for all these good reviews here.",2
The Witcher,"I don't understand why so many people rate this show 9 and 10. I want a new season too but we gotta be honest so that they can make the show better.Pros: good fighting scenes, good acting, story somewhat close to the novels. 
Cons: timeline is just messy. I mean the book can pull that off but a show? I don't think so. Also Gerald and Yennefer romance develops too fast. Nilfgaardian armor looks like trash. Also, too much emphasis on the mage. True the books cover mage and politics in length but this is a show with limited run time, personally I think it could be beneficial to shift more focus on Gerald and his witchering.I don't even want to touch those subtle sjw clues, ew.",7
The Witcher,"The Witcher not only honors the source material but is visually stunning. Henry Cavill is a worthy Geralt of Rivia while the show also brings a ton of diversity on screen which has been missing from the fantasy genre for quite some time.This show is a decent addition to the Witcher series and serves as a kind of prequel to those familiar with the games. It tries to appeal to book fans, game fans, and those new to the Witcher which tends to water down the experience for everyone. Most of the negative reviews I've read are from people who are not familiar with the tone of the source material. You could say it might be a bit confusing to newcomers, but to fans, this is glorious. It is not game of thrones and is not trying to be. Cavill is perfect as Geralt. I will only deduct half a star because I think the exposition in the first episode was a little clunky and I would have a more faithful depiction of Triss Merigold.",8
The Witcher,Every scene is over dramatic. Costumes look cheap. CGI is bad. Writing is bad. Geralt's accent isn't right.Some of the human on human action scenes are cool. That's about it. On par with Netflix programming.,4
The Witcher,"This is a dream come true, the acting is great and the chosen stories are just perfect for people who've never played the games (or read the books) before, there's quite a few differences but that still didn't affect The Witcher ""vibes"".
I wish they just don't keep the variation in races in next season, it would just feel more immersive to keep some common sense, as African and Asian races were non existent in those lands at the time",10
The Witcher,"I have not played The Witcher games. I have not read the print materials for The Witcher. Let me save you the time and spoil every episode in four bullet points.If the character is a male King, they're totally incompetent or at the whims of their OP Queen.
Queens are all military geniuses who are masters with swords.
Any male character who appears to have a brain or is eloquent is a rapist, liar or a thief.
If the story has a ""victim"" character, they're always oppressed by the patriarchy. They will inevitably rise over the patriarchy and become OP. They're also always female.The only exception to these rules is Henry Cavill's character who feels like they belong in a different show (probably the ""token"" male that Kathleen Kennedy is not willing to allow in her Star Wars films). The only male character who isn't a rapist/cad/villain who is decent at any time is Cavill.Don't get me wrong. Most of the female characters are poorly portrayed, unlikeable (although I think you're meant to like them) and have some flaws, usually cosmetic.Each episode has a different location. The Witcher (Cavill) comes in and is given exposition. Girl power kicks in and outsmarts the patriarchy. Cavill cleans up. Done! Repeat the same in the next episode.The sets are excellent. The woman with a hunchback is probably the most interesting female character. However, her character arc was as predictable as the sun rising.I didn't even need to guess the sex of the author of this series. The only reason I watched this is because Cavill said to Disney and the media not to attack fans. Cavill has done a solid job. Everyone else male (to paraphrase one of the characters) has no balls. The female characters are always secretly in charge and OP, even when fighting men twice their size.If you're into hyper-aggressive this is your series. If you want realistic and meaningful characters, skip any scene that doesn't have Cavill in it. Cavill's dialog is usually very good (both in humour and wisdom). The rest is forgettable.5/10 is generous for how predictable and identity politic laden it is.",5
The Witcher,"If anyone can follow this, please send me the drugs you take. From an opening scene I did not care about to a stream of characters I cared less about. The bright spot? Yeah. I search my mind.",1
The Witcher,I saw several critical reviews about The Witcher before I watched as I had my own reservations. When reading the reviews most of the negative reviews make it obviously clear the critic has never read or interacted with either the source novels/short stories or the popular game series. This series captures the themes of the story in a way I had frankly thought impossible to do on tv or film. I hope they continue this series for a long time.,10
The Witcher,"I just finished watching the series and thought it was quite good, very entertaining for the most part. Although the stories of Yennefer and Ciri were important to the understanding of the story I wish Geralt had more screen time. Often I would want to see what was happening with Geralt instead of Yennefer and Ciri. Just my opinion though and most people might disagree with that but that was a minor part and other than that I had a great time watching.",9
The Witcher,"""The Witcher"" is basically Henry Cavill prancing around with a bad Legolas wig in what is one of the most expensive LARPs ever.This show is what would have happened if CW got to air a wannabe fantasy series with a larger budget and less content restrictions.An utter dreck of a show, badly written, directed and acted. Worse, it is boring as hell, dreary and hard to get through.I really, really miss ""Game Of Thrones""...No thanks...1 out of 10",1
The Witcher,"A fantastic remake of the books, follows them really well. So much better than other TV/movie adaptations of other books that have been made. Henry plays Gerald so well and you can clearly tell he is a fan of the Witcher character. A must watch TV series. You know it's good when you get to the end of the series and realise it was 8 hours well spent.",10
The Witcher,Fan of the games and was very happy to see some hints to it while keeping the style different. The whole different timelines was also amazing. It all converged right at the end to tie the season up perfectly.,10
The Witcher,"It got better a couple episodes in. A lot felt forced, stiff, and didn't have enough suspension of disbelief (that magic touch). But it was good enough to keep me watching and liking it more as it went on. I didn't like the puzzle of events though. Can't wait for a fan edit putting events in sequential order. Just that thing that is hard to put into words. You feel it is all fake whether it is acting, timing, camera work, wire work, choreography or what not. Closer to Shannara chronicles than Game of Thrones in suspension of disbelief. Or World of Warcraft (the movie) rather than Lord of the Rings.",8
The Witcher,"Big fan, read the books and they nailed it !
Just keep the good work for many more seasons.",10
The Witcher,"This is one of the best sci-fi tv show
I ever knew, I truly recommend it for any sci-fi fans you will enjoy it I swear, you will finish the show without even knowing, I love this show with it chracters and monsters I love, you won't regreat this I promise",10
The Witcher,The voice.I have been compelled to extend the length of this review in order to share my review of the show. This is not necessary. The voice was key.,10
The Witcher,This show is awesome. You can tell Henry has read all the books and played all the games.  crowd hate it so any sensible person will enjoy it. Fight scenes are epic. CGI is beast mode. Writing and acting is on fleek. You can have strong Male characters in 2019 and strong females too. If they pander to the lefties in season 2 like GoT did then I'll be a sad panda. Watch it you nerds. Good shows without a political agenda still exist - on Netflix.,10
The Witcher,"Basically, this series ignores the fact that this world takes place in a Polish Medieval Fantasy setting and uses forced diversity on already incredibly well established and described characters to the point of not even knowing you're looking at Fringilla Vigo or Triss Merigold until they blatantly tell you that is who you're looking at. Henry does a fantastic job but there is no way his performance could carry the rest of the poor casting that re-imagines a beloved and well established universe.",1
The Witcher,"The casting, the writing, the costumes, the acting, the story, the choreography; you name it, it's all terrible. I feel embarrassed wasting several hours of my life just to get a proper feel for this.It is bad. It is worse than bad. The people who made this, who were involved in this and the people who like this should never be allowed to be involved in making entertainment ever again.If this was truly medieval times, they'd be executed. What a trash.",1
The Witcher,"I played the first Witcher game many years ago, so I had some familiarity with the characters at least. Other than that, my familiarity with Witcher stuff is not strong. I went into this series pretty much based on the fact that I do like fantasy.I was pleasantly surprised by how well the production was done here. Honestly, my one reservation about The Witcher was the casting of Cavill. No slight to him at all, but I just felt an unknown and upcoming actor would be more suitable to the role of Geralt. An actor that folks will have no preconceived notions about from prior work - I mean this is the guy who played Superman. Put that to rest though, as Cavill is not just fine but a great Geralt. He really owns the character.Other surprises abound, and for those who have played the games, or at least the first one like me, there are ties to it in the storyline. i can't speak to the books though.Another pleasant surprise is the actress who plays Yennifer, and the character herself. Let's just say it is very pleasant and leave it as that. Regardless, not knowing her at all I'd say she is an up-and-comer after this show.Don't let critic reviews fool you or sway you. The Witcher is a very nice production with fine acting, cinematography, atmosphere and storytelling. It is highly entertaining stuff if you are into fantasy and maybe even if you are not. I think it is clear that the average critic was probably a little lost and confused given the usual 3 or 4 episodes they are fed for reviews. And honestly, the first couple of episodes can be a bit confusing, especially from a timeline standpoint. That was clearly be design. But as a you watch more things fall into place and connections are made. My recommendation is to just go with the flow and be entertained by the moment - it will all come together. Just slow absorb yourself into the original world the Witcher inhabits.Definitely one of the very top production from Netflix to date.",9
The Witcher,"I am not the person to write the reviews which in itself says how awesome this season is. When adapting any previously released material, biggest mess up that happens is in understanding and recreating the setting and the world. Being a big fan of witcher games, I can confidently say that this series captures the essence of the environment and its characters perfectly.
Henry Cavill is pure awesome as Geralt. Same goes for Anya Chalotra as Yennefer and Freya Allen. I love that they had a story arch themselves making them much more important in the series.
Action is fantastic especially the 1st episode nicely setting up the expectation and the meaning of a Witcher.
I like the pick of the story for the series as well as it has been mentioned the games but never shown properly. So, this nicely ties the series with games.
Really excited for the season 2....",10
The Witcher,"Of all things that witcher is, its not corny, its dark, sad, suspensful , moody , intenseThe witcher is not bad by any means, most people would like it, but i have a lot of time spent in the games therefore i just cannot enjoy the netflix adaptation like i would if i hadnt given a few hundred hours into the games. The characters are all very forgettable,it seems as though the makeup is too perfect and looks overly made, it all feels like a kids show with overly brushed effects and lighthings.At times i almost feel like they werent too sure how dark they could go so they made sure to put some comic relief in there alongside of a disneyesque morales and corny dialogues.Most of the acting is subpar, if you were to compare it to say game of thrones of viking, there really is no deepness to them, i feel mostly because of the shallow scriptsAll in all, okay, but not great.",7
The Witcher,"Remember all those terrible SyFy network shows from the past 10/20 years? Add another $10 to their budget and this is what you get. I was super excited to see this after seeing the trailers and playing the games, but when you feel embarrassed for the actors while watching, that is about the worst thing I can describe. It is simply bad. Very bad.",1
The Witcher,The worst acting ever put on screen. The legendary adventures of Hercules should get an Oscar in comparison to this.,7
The Witcher,I had high expectations and this show delivered. I wouldn't listen too much to the critics. I'd say be your own judge and give it a chance. Books and games fan will not be disappointed.,10
The Witcher,Being a fan of the games this season brought a smile to my face couldn't stop watching. NEED SEASON 2 NOW!,8
The Witcher,"**Edited**
""Honest review as a fan:As an actual TV show this is not that great when compared to other shows out there. Considering this has been billed as ""the next Game of Thrones"", to say I'm disappointed is an understatement. This is simply not in the same league.The production value is clearly very good. Right in the first episode we have a big battle and lots going on. The problem is, there is immediately too much going on, and there has been no world building prior to any of the events, no character development and no real context for what you are about to watch. It is as if much of what has been written outright expects you already know the characters and where they are and what is going on. This is not good writing in my opinion and does not serve to immerse you in the world. You feel disconnected and you are watching over the top emotional scenes about characters who've had less than 10 minutes screen time (Ep1: Eist and Calathes death). It makes no sense.The pacing is all over the place. One minute there is a load of stuff happening with multiple concurrent stories with different characters, then the next minute you get a long monologue with corny exposition often poorly acted by a sub-par supporting cast (Ep2: One example is switching between Yennefer and the relatively weak elves plot). And as for the casting itself, there are clearly some questionable casting choices which in my opinion are there to make a political statement rather than casting actual actors who make sense (Triss and Fringilla, although show runner Lauren has stated it was a decision made purely on merit).The main characters luckily are the few redeeming features of the show. Henry Cavill does a good enough job as Geralt in spite of some terrible writing (Ep1: One particularly awkard moment is the disscusion about the rhyme with Stegabor). Note I say, good enough. It's not spectacular. Yennefer also, is probably the most enjoyable character to watch besides Geralt.The swordplay is fantastic and definitely the highlight of the show, although something seems odd about the CGI being used for many of the monsters (The cockroach monster and the dragon specifically). I can't quite put my finger on what it is but everything looks 'off' when it comes to the CGI.There is a LOT of cringeworthy dialogue, just as you start to get invested in a character the show seems to switch to something else entirely or provides such a cliche piece of dialogue you'll be thrown right out of your immersion (Think Jaskiers ""there I go again, dropping exposition"" line, or Geralt's ""petty squabbles of men"" and ""navigated vagaries of male traditions"", also the constant mention of destiny or the on-the-nose dialogue of the lesser evil ultimatum). It seems to happen far too much that the show never seems to get into any kind of rhythm, it feels more like you are reading a comic book storyboard constantly trying to grab your attention, than a cohesive tv show with some actual thought behind the pacing and narrative.My biggest criticism has to be that there is a real lack of believable world building which I think for a show like this is absolutely needed. If you compare to Game of Thrones, which I know many will find cheap, GoT didn't just start off by throwing event after event at you and expecting you to keep up with what was going on from corny exposition every other minute. It started off instead in a relatively small scope, focused on a few select characters in a single time frame and built from there over successive episodes and series. The Witcher sadly doesn't do this at all, it expects you to already have an understanding of the world and throws way too much over the top stuff at you from the beginning.Overall, it's at least watchable, but I certainly don't understand the hype everyone seems to be giving it. I found it to be a big fat disappointment.""",6
The Witcher,"Where are his signs?
Wasn't the fire sign Triss '?
But other than that his signs are barely present in any episode",7
The Witcher,"First of all, this review is done by an average, not that picky but serious movie geek. I can admire a film if it has worthy elements like: a good story, cinematography, production, acting, and scenery. However, i felt that the series fell in some of this points.Anyaways, After having high-expectations with Netflix's recent productions, great movies (the Irishman and Marriage Story), Netflix come back to its series with ""The Witcher"", a fanstasy-epic series based on the popular video game series by the same name and apparently popular. Tbh im not a fan and was not familiar with the story, i was intrigued by it, it seemed interesting. The series promotions looked amazing. Henry Cavill?! Nice touch, but still this doesnt save the mess this series is. Here are a few things that i didnt like:
1- what is the story?! I mean, did you really expected everyone to be familiarized with the videogame?! At least have a small intro explaining the world's details (aka LOTR), but don't expect me to catch up immediately or be interested by it.
2- Who are the characters?! Again to the story, they dont have anything in common there is no thread. Im not even familiarized with the world and in they throw random things, that dont make any sense.
3- Some of the scenes are just awfull! I rolled my eyes so back, I literally saw my brain, geez! Its like Geralt is talking to someone some ""clichy and magic thingy"" and then the girl is just over him and they do it. Like what?! No chemistry ir buildup, just random stuff as if watching someone okay GTA.
4- Also on the acting on some scenes the dialogue and acting ir scene its very mediocre. Some of the scenes dont even make sense, like a guy is doing something, then suddenly cant do that or does some deux ex machina.
5- Im already 3 episodes in and i cant say i have liked or enjoyed it. Tbh its BORING, the fight scenes are so separated, the story is not well explained, its a mess, i still cant follow up, most of the time, random stuff happens.In conclusion, DO NOT WATCH IT! Its a waste of time. There are many other great shows in Netflix (Mindhunter, Unabomber, Stranger Things, House of Cards, Maniac, Dark, Black Mirror, among others) However, this show is not it, nor does it seem it can be. So much for a Netflix production, but you they hired bad writers.",4
The Witcher,"Alright, I didn't watch all 8 episodes so far but the final fight scene of episode 1 already sold the show to me. Its a bit confusing to watch if you don't know the games or the books, but it's not like GoT was easy to understand with all the characters and factions. Not drawing a comparison here between those shows, they are (and should be) completely different. Good job Netflix! And again, screw the ""professional"" critics with their political agendas. This show is worth a watch.",7
The Witcher,"This show is absolutely great! I binged watched the entirety of the 8 episodes the minute it was released. The acting is phenomenal, the effects are phenomenal. It's dark and exactly what I would expect.Please stop comparing it to GOT or even the book equivalent. You're just setting yourself up by predetermining whether you're going to love it or hate it. Look at it as it's own entity and you will not be let down!I also just want to throw this out there, that the main actor does a great job of sounding EXACTLY like Geralt from the games and it got me so excited when I watched the first episode. Who cares if he doesn't look old and ugly enough? He is still a phenomenal actor!",10
The Witcher,Henry perfectly captures the character and nature of the witcher. Everybody did great acting job. I read all the books and characters are very similar. I love the TV-Witcher!!!!!!! I think for viewers who didn't read books it could be too tangled. There are few timelines during the story. I can't wait for the next season :),10
The Witcher,"Edit: I'll leave my previous review as a memory of Season 1. I didn't expect that showrunners could trash it this much. Season 3 was a fail.Old review:
Overall Recommendation: With many fantasy series around, I'd say its more than worth watching because its a different concept than usualMy actual rating would be somewhere around 8.6 or 8.7.The higher rating could be a slight bias because I have played the games and read bit of books as well. But I did not have much expectations from it.That being said, acting was more than good. Henry Cavill worked out as geralt and the character of yennefer is played beautifully.I love a good story and some things that were hard to make sense from books were pretty clear to me in the series. Considering each episode was like a short story, they all seemed well connected.Looking forward to the next season.",5
The Witcher,"I just finished episode 3 and I'm hooked. For those that will compare this to Game of Thrones, please stop. Yes, this is a sword and sorcery show as was Game. But give the writers some credit. They didn't copy GoT or rip it off in any way. They have created a beautiful stand alone sword and sorcery show that has every thing that a fan of this genre can ask for. Knights. Kings and Queens. Magic. Monsters. Fighting. Sex. Nudity. Humor, but not so much that you don't take it seriously. Henry Cavill is great as The Witcher. I am a fan of his anyways. Superman of course but loved him a lot in MI: Fallout. Great baddy for Ethan Hunt to take on. And for those that want to call this a poor mans GoT, please dont do that. Netflix has spent a lot of money on this show and it is apparent. The acting. The effects. The production value. The great writing. Wipe thoughts of GoT right out of your mind and let this stand alone in your mind, as it should. Comparing the two only makes you want things that will never happen because they are not copying GoT. They have made a wonderful sword and sorcery show that is every bit of the 9.2 IMDB rating that is posted as of today. For those that knock it below that, what is your problem? Dont be haters if you were GoT fans and think its a knock off or ripoff. Just open your mind and let this show carry you away. You will love it. I do. And I am a big fan of GoT. I frigging loved that show. But I already love this show and I suspect I wont be disappointed as I continue towards episode 8 and sadly, the end of the line for Season one. Please release season 2 quick!",10
The Witcher,"Not many Spoilers...
Absolute horrible. Shouldnt this be based off the game? Or should we have expected a Game of thrones copy?
No character build up.
I hate how they target a feminist audience to begin with. Depicting almost all men and mages as bad.
For a character being of a hard nature, and a monster slayer, the witcher easily becomes seduced by the grip of a random woman who claims was raped. So she seduces the witcher to kill a mage. I mean what the hell is this story line?Sigh*
Cant type much without giving spoilers away....",1
The Witcher,Fantasy story telling done very well.Rich in characters you care about.Worth the 8 hr binge.Many great stories to come I am sure.,10
The Witcher,Xena and Hercules are so much better than this series. This is a cheap show with some nudity.,4
The Witcher,Just Amazing. The deliver on acts are really impressive.,10
The Witcher,"Fan of the game and read the 1st book here:
As a TV series adaptation, I'm extremely happy how they did it. Main characters play it very well, Gerart de Rivia by Henry Cavil was so on point I have to eat my own words when I doubted him. The show made me enjoy the world of The Witcher at every turn, the music was so fitting.
Probably the downside was some of the monsters but I really don't care so much since everything else was above expectations.Some of the ""critics"" obviously want to create a click-bate title, as for users: Watch it, you will enjoy it.",10
The Witcher,"If you want to make fantasy movie about people with the swords, some monsters and witches why don't simple make some of your own idea without ruining good name and original book?Bad acting, bad dialogues, bad drama. This is like Disney movie for teenagers, the only good thing is scenes of action, fights etc, but this is also the only good and the last good thing in all recent productions.
Probably ""The cliché"" is a new rule for every screenwriter and director this time.",3
The Witcher,"An amazing, thought provoking series. I cannot wait to see what comes next!",10
The Witcher,"Going into the series I was petrified on how it will turn out. I'm a huge witcher fan so I went in with high expectations. The atmosphere was very witcher, costumes were on point. Sword fighting scenes were amazing. Geralt was played exquisitely, kudos to the actor. This series should not be compared to anything. It is its own unique story with its own atmosphere. I can't wait to see more character development and progression to the story. So far so good.
Most bad/mediocre reviews I've read are from old people that do not get it, that's fine. It hit its target audience very well, unfortunately you are not it.",9
The Witcher,"I was hesitant about this title. I played the Witcher 3 all the way through and it was one of the best games I ever played but I have never read the books. Than I was a victim to irrational internet hate, (why was this actor chosen, it's exclusively Polish in setting, ect.) So I just watched it. First two episodes and I had to stop. Because I want to ration it out. The show is great. Set aside all the B.S. and it's true to the game, the lore is fantastic, the acting is good, and you get a great fight in the first episode. I compare this to the start of the Witcher 3. It seems a little boring. You think, ""Is this all?"" And then you get out of the training area and realize the world and lore is HUGE. Give it a chance and tell everyone else to Shut.",9
The Witcher,"I think alot of people will dive into this show expecting it to be "" the next game of thrones"" much like how when game of thrones came out, some people thought it was going to be the next lord of the rings.If i can offer any word of advice, it is to watch this show without those expectations. There has been 8 seasons worth of story that helped establish GOT as one of the greatest fantasy shows of all time haha. So to expect this to be anything close to that right now is dumb and now having watched it im ashamed in myself for setting that very expectation.Once you get passed that, personally i think this works very well for a 1st season. If youre a fan of epic fantasy in general like me, you're going to love this. Lots of sword play and fight sequences to keep you entertained, the story is intriguing, the acting is fantastic. If youre a fan of the novels and video games , i think youre also going to enjoy it as well. So all in all im pretty impressed and will definitely look forward to seeing this shows story continue to develop.",8
The Witcher,"I didn't expect much from this show, mostly because i didn't think its possible to make good show about Withcer. I was so wrong. This show is best show i have seen 20 years. Anya Chalotra, Freya Allan and specially Henry Cavill as Geralt did awesome job. I do not understand why some people say it looks cheap? Maybe they should use better internet connections. It is dark yes, but it should be too. There is blood, but it ain't only that. Story is good, acting is good, special effects are good and directing is good. It's loyal to books and brings up what it should be, even if you are monster hunter, biggest monsters in world are people.",10
The Witcher,"No other words other than the title are necessary, highly recommended.",10
The Witcher,"They say it is a cheaper version of GOT. If this masterpiece is a cheaper version of GOT than GOT was a cheaper version of Harry Potter. If you loved Harry Potter, you would have loved GoT and if you have loved GOT you would definitely love THE WITCHER.",10
The Witcher,"If you loved playing any of the Witcher games like I did, you'll probably love this show.Yes, lets get it out of the way first: some of the supporting roles casting choices feel strange at the beginning if you are already familiarized with their appearances from the games, which is even more evident when they get to be in a scene with Henry Cavill, who makes such a spot on Gerald both in his acting and in appearance that he rapidly merges with all previous memory of the character in your head. But I did came to terms with this somewhere midway through the the first episodes and had more to do with unfulfilled personal expectations than with the casting itself.For people who have enjoyed this world in any of its previous forms, it becomes quite clear after only a few episodes that this might not be a TV show for everyone. If you start watching the Witcher expecting anything similar to Game of Thrones you will be extremely disappointed. The Witcher's World is far more magical and fantastical, filled with strange creatures, rules and Monsters. This is in no way the show that eases you in with some big wolf pets in the first episode and slowly feeds you more fantastical elements until you are OK with Dragons hatching in the last episode of its first season. No. The Witcher is hardcore fantasy from beginning to end, and it is clearly not trying to tone it down. And I love it for it, because it's far more consistent than Game of thrones for that same reason. This is in my opinion one of the bolder choices the writers took with this show and is one of the things that makes for such divisive reviews until now. They respected the overall feeling of their source material and It´s one of those things that you realize might be perfect for you but also know that some people just won´t be able to digest. This show is not your average Pepperoni Pizza, but rather a weird blue cheese that you know smells like hell to most people, but that was made with love and care for all us blue cheese loving weirdos out there. So for people who were let down by GOTs last season expecting to get another GOT like slice of Pizza, I got news for you: this ones full of Anchovies, and you will know if you'll like it a long time before you bite into it.This show also feels much darker, and, at moments, also lighter than Game of thrones. This is a far more focused story, which is actually a great thing for the characters involved in it. Every story line feels important enough to deserve the screen time each of them gets and the performances of the leading roles are excellent. The pacing feels like it hits a great balance between advancing the plot and developing the characters motivations and personalities.The soundtrack is one of the shows strongest points: It's actually amazing, and serves the storytelling extremely well.
CGI holds up great most of the time with a few questionable models here and there. I specially loved the practical effects and costumes used for some of the creatures and characters in this show, much how I love those aspects in Star Wars films, but again, might feel a tiny bit too puppet-like for some audiences.All in all, I loved the first season of The Witcher, and I can´t wait to see more of it; This is definitely not a perfect show for mainstream audiences, but it might be just the perfect Witcher TV-show. This is clearly not the show that critics need right now, but rather the show Witcher fans deserve.",10
The Witcher,"Firstly i loved the games, and in my opinion they have better written dialogues then the show. The ost is not too good, it""s not bad , but far from perfect(the games' music was a lot better), however Jaskier's song are suprisingly good.
The pacing is little bit weird.
The not ""european"" actors are immersion breaking.
The cgi not bad, but it could be better.
The photography is okay, but the ""coloring"" is some times looks awful.
The acting is okay except Hanry Cavil's and Freya Allan's, 'cause they are perfect.
The story feels a little bit strange, but the book was a short story collection and not a novel, so it's a lot harder to make it into a season length story. Ohh and Henry Cavill is a superb Geralt and Freya Allan is just the perfect Ciri.",6
The Witcher,"Yeah yeah, I've read the books, I've played the games and now, now I've seen the film too.The Witcher is a natural fit for TV, in fact the games have demonstrated as much with some of the best CG cutscenes of all time. If you have not watched the cutscenes from the games, you should, because the cutscenes demonstrate what is possible with computer technology - anything. So why use live action puppets which cannot match the magic of computer wizardry? Some of the special effects in this show are remarkably poor for our time and era. Underfunded perhaps? But not enough to mis sout on having a ""star"" on the bill.The show brings the books to life, (if you can ignore the shabby monsters) and while ordinarily that might be a good thing, here it backfires, especially since the tone of the books is somewhat micheivious, but on film such dedication to accuracy can lead to awkwardness on screen.Finally, Cavill is miscast. He's too pretty to be a convincing Witcher, but his performance is pretty good, even if it lacked some menace.",6
The Witcher,"This show started strong, but ultimately it never delivered on the promise of its first episode.
What's the point of a bad-ass monster hunter if his monster hunting takes a back-seat to a truly convoluted story involving more kingdom names than I can keep track of? Each episode after the first had more and more characters introduced and it was tiring to try to figure out which ones ultimately mattered to the story. And forget about remembering anyone's name!
On top of that I came into this series with maybe eighteen minutes of playtime in one of the first Witcher games several years ago, so I was very much in the dark regarding the lore of the world, and the show-runners' decision to LEAVE me there was fatally flawed IMO.
Now that I have finished the first season I am left with way too many questions and no answers outside of spending hours on google doing research.
And truth be told, I just don't care enough to bother.
4/10 Stars. Maybe it would be better if I was already into the franchise.",4
The Witcher,"I confess I'm a sci fi nut, and I'm not into fantasy (there is a difference, folks). Nevertheless, I was excited to see The Witcher finally released on Netflix. This has been touted as the ""fill in"" for Game of Thrones. Whilst the huge budget expended on GoT was screamingly obvious, this looks like it was made with a few packets of plasticine & a warehouse full of artificial flowers. It's truly, badly, deeply vile. The acting is atrocious (even though there's some usually fantastic Scandinavian actors in it). The special effects are truly ""special"", in a really bad way.......and who the hell was in-charge of the green screen? The actors look like paper cut outs in front of a poorly painted backdrop. With every outing, Netflix is just getting worse and worse in its original content. A real stinker.",1
The Witcher,Other than the timelines being a bit confusing at first (even for a big fan of the books and games!) and some casting issues the show is great. Cavil really nailed Geralt and the others have all done great jobs as well. This is a must watch!,8
The Witcher,I really really do love the Witcher and I will watch it until they stop making the Witcher.,9
The Witcher,"Though i have not read the books, I am familiar with them and have finished witcher 2 and 3.I liked how they built up the Witchers world and are quite close to the original books while doing so. The series nicely caps the rise and fall of the the Nation of Cintra as we follow Geralt, Jaskia (Dandelion), Ciri, and Yennefer through the years.All main characters get plenty of screen time while others are setup to probably play a larger role in future seasons such as Triss and Foltest.Ciri was played really well which is always a risk for ""young"" characters and watching her and Geralt finally meet each other at the end was a nice touch.",10
The Witcher,"As a game fan (who played Witcher games in the order of 1, 2, 3) and a book fan I find the Netflix adaptation to be...adequate. They make an entertaining watching experience, but there are things I find to be severe flaws.First of all let's list the good stuff: choreography is amazing - it makes Geralt truly fight like a mutated master swordsman that he is. Cast is well chosen - everyone fits the part perfectly. Production value is very high - something I was worried about but I'm happy to find out that Netflix spared no expense. It is also very faithful to the source material - all the major stories get told as they happened.If I have to describe my feeling now, however, I'd say that the entire show is cast under the shadow of a dark, ominous cloud brooding together with Geralt. Henry Cavill has chosen to portray a brooding, dark, and monotonic Geralt. That is entirely fine. After all, Geralt is often like that both in the books and in the games. However, that is not what he is all the time! Based on the books, for all his brooding Geralt does enjoy the regular human sensual pleasures, so feasting and drinking (not of the royal kind) will get some laugh out of him; Geralt is a professional and can be incredibly patient and understanding when investigating monster details; Also Geralt often takes some secret pleasure in being considered powerful if not feared by the common folk... The list goes on. So Geralt has many more sides than just ""dark."" Adding a little of these other sides of his character would have made him so much more fleshed out and believable.The dark cloud reaches over the writing, too. Here the show I think suffers from a too literal adaptation of the books. I read both The Last Wish and Sword of Destiny. Those short stories set up an entertaining premise and make a fun read, but in term of the quality of literature they are not on the same level as A Song of Ice and Fire, for example. The dialogues are often multi-page monologues giving ominous moral expositions, and the writing, while mature and pensive, are not quite clever or sharp. When adapted for the show, the result is similar: characters seem to break into monologue mode out of nowhere - which in many cases is not how real human beings talk; their lines are often incredibly pensive and reflective, but often devoid of smartness or delight. Of course the show is supposed to be dark and mature, but that does not conflict with high quality writing.The show also has this mind-boggling triple story line, each taking place at a different time. It's not an issue for me since I read the books, but my girlfriend was completely lost and I had to explain many things to her. I don't imagine this structure would work well for those who are not intimately familiar with the source material. But hey, I might be wrong on that.Overall I think the show has much room for improvement. Perhaps the showrunner ought to approach this project less as a ""adaptation,"" but more as a ""recreation?"" There's a reason why the best part of the Witcher 3 are the parts where CDPR wrote entirely new stories and characters - Bloody Baron, Olgierd & Gaunter O'Dimm etc.",7
The Witcher,"After binging all of it , i can now safely say that this show is nowhere near masterclass. First of all, this series spend way to much time on things that doesn't matter, on characters we don't care about. The overall feeling i have after seeing the entire first season is that this is adapted very close to how the games work, where we have Geralt walking from one place to the other, picking up side quests as he goes along.Now side quests are perfectly fine in Games, but they are called side quests for a reason, and this TV show should be more focused on it's core narrative. It does however start to pick up by episode 5 or thereabouts, but by then i was really tired of watching things that didn't matter.You could actually draw parallels from this show to ""The Mandalorian"", they are sort of based on the same story narrative. Where the protagonist walks from one place to the next, picking up jobs on the way. But the entire tone is completely different, as ""The Mandalorian"" doesn't take itself too seriously, and loves to play around a bit, ""The Witcher"" is the opposite. So IMO, this fall ""The Mandalorian"" was a big surprise and a series i find quite entertaining, while ""The Witcher"" disappoints.The acting in The Witcher isn't that good either, i mean, it really isn't. The costumes aren't that great either. The entire show feels cheap in places it shouldn't feel cheap. If you are going to make a dead serious show, you better have the money behind it.But the cinematography are at times spectacular, with beautiful landscape shots with great color grading. But when it comes to battle sequences, they could be shot way better. Before this show came out, the producers said this show would make GoT fighting scenes look dull, that's not the case what so ever. For everyone who saw ""Battle of the Bastards"", you know it would take some effort to make those scenes look dull. It is of course possible to make something better, but this show isn't one of those shows.This show is as it stands right now, rated way too high.The show gets better with each episode, but not much. First season overall is not much more than a mediocre experience which should focus more on being a TV series, rather than a computer game.6/10 - Fair",6
The Witcher,"This is Sorbo's Hercules minus the soul. Cavill is pretty decent but other than that this is so difficult to like. The plot is really weak, and I could not even enjoy it as a guilty pleasure. Why can't we cast Cavill in something better is beyond me. I sincerely hope you like it more than I did.",3
The Witcher,"It's funny how people either loved it or hated it.I'm with the loving ones!Most of the bad critics i've read are based on comparison with GOT and on high expectations not met, i'd say that's an awful way to build your opinion on anything...I loved the show, it got me hooked really quickly and i think it would do the same to anyone trying it without expecting too much from a first season.The only negative comment i would have is that some parts are hard to follow at first as time shifts back and forth at some points.It's also a shame that it only has 10 episodes, i would have taken more!---Edit: Everything i wrote about season 1 still holds, but the following seasons really disappointed me: crucial elements removed from the material source, poor representation of characters and events, and new things that don't make sense. I reduced my rating to 8/10, would have reduced it even more if it wasn't for the first season.",8
The Witcher,If you like Game of Thrones or Lord of the rings you may very well like this series. I started an episode to see how it was and ended up on a 4 hour binge... needless to say the cast performs quite well and they definitely have good cinematography!,9
The Witcher,The show is fast paced and the action scenes are really well choreographed. The the plot does not lag behind and is well narrated.,10
The Witcher,"For the first three to four episodes they seemed to be mediocre, but then as the story unfolds everything appears to be connected and becomes intriguing. Cant wait for season 2!
P.S. I didn't give it a 10/10 because the music is a bit weird.",7
The Witcher,"Everything is 10 stars worth, but Yen character is stupidly written. That is only bad thing about this.",10
The Witcher,"Triss Merigold and Fringila Vigo are not black in the books nor the video games. This is pandering to the masses and it kinda ruins the series for me. The series as a whole is ok. Geralt, Ciri and Yennefer are perfect.",5
The Witcher,"I had no anticipation. Most adaptions are lacking. This delivers from episode one and doesn't stop. Great action, character development, and such a story. Come on season 2!!!",10
The Witcher,"I did not have high expectations for this series, given recent disappointments with some recent Netflix originals. This show surprised me in so many ways. I was absolutely stunned at how well Henry nailed one of my favourite characters. I can only hope that the inevitable second season lives up to this one.",9
The Witcher,"The first episode was quite solid and I was looking forward to how it escalates. But later on too many characters are just popping up and multiple side stories make the screenplay a mess. The show looks like a compilation of fillers which is poorly edited. I remember myself checking time again and again after few episodes. This show had a great potential but the script is still uncooked. Henry C is amazing as the Witcher but the supporting cast is a hit or a miss. The costume design also looks contemporary sometimes and takes you out from the mediaeval era. The main plot is too far stretched and can be converted into a four episode mini series to be honest. The action was good, also effects on the creatures were great sometimes except the dragon, it looks fake as frick. Overall it's a show you can skip and society would still accept you. And people comparing it with game of thrones should chill. It's not even 10% near it, inspite of having a bad season finale, GOT is not comparable to this show.",5
The Witcher,Never having read the book (books?) or even heard of the game I had no expectations. This is a by-the-numbers fantasy tale. Acting is fine although the roles are so stereotyped that it is undemanding on the performers. Geralt speaks in a Carlsberg Lager voice. Production is fine. Not great but not bad. The armies could be bigger. I felt a touch of Sharpe where the same soldiers rode or matched by and there were fewest wide angle shots.On the plus side it is easy watching.,6
The Witcher,"Ok, first things first, red the books, played the games. Loved them. Sapkowsky is trully a great writer, and i recomend everyone to pick up the witcher books and read them.
The good, and very good: the actors played the characters very well, they are all really talented. Costumes, lighting, music, swordplay, atmosphere, scenery enjoyed all of it.
The bad. Pacing, writing and the so called adaptation. I dont konw it these people have red past the third book. Everything is rushed, all the stories butchered, it's confusing, and it's a mess. Even outright mistakes. They let out all the crucial and important stuff. A lot of scenes left without impact because of others that weren't included. There is alot to say, but i recomand the people who didn't read the books to red them. It will help you understant.
The whole thing feels rushed, they needed to give the plots more time. Either more than 8 episodes, or two seasons. As an adaptation the story, about witch the produces said it would be faithfull the books, this show is a 3 or 4 , luckly everything else saves it. As a generic fatasy show, maybe an 7-8.
I hope they will do better next season, i want this show to succeed because i love the witcher, but we can't hand out 9 and 10. Just because we like Henry, or the music in that first episode got me exited.
For now, this series, and it panis me, it's a 6",7
The Witcher,"This show is gorgeous. The casting is very good, the action was extremely good, if you start it you really can't pause it. The story is well linked so you just have to stay and watch. I've waited for this show since it was announced and it made up to my expectation almost surpassed. Waiting for part 2. *cheers*",10
The Witcher,"At episode 4/8 and am incredibly impressed with the show so far. If things cahnge for teh worse I'll change my review, but felt compelled to share my opinion since critics are being on the show so hard. Has the vibe of the games and books, grey areas abound and a horrific taste for action. Definitely doesn't pull any punches. I wholeheartedly recommend you watch it.",8
The Witcher,It's hard to peel myself off the TV while watching this show. There are many elements and characters. It prompted me to research the show online.,10
The Witcher,"...and the audience rating is extremely misleading. At least if you're not a hardcore fan of the eponymous books and/or video games. The first episode follows up a brief action shot with 30 minutes of spoken exposition. There is an unironic scene where the main character recites his backstory to a horse. If all this ""tell, don't show"" were at least slightly interesting, but it all seems incredibly dry and far-fetched. Names of fictional places are dropped like confetti. Random people enter the stage and recount made-up historical events like D&D-playing high schoolers.Finally, the main character gets to prove his martial skill again and it looks like a scene straight from a video game. Fast dolly shots and slow-mo sequences capture every gruesome death in gut-churning detail. I'm can stomach a fair amount of violence, even cheesy and overly gory violence à la 300 or Spartacus. But this is just too ridiculous. It feels like watching a Twitch stream without the webcam commentary. If you're as unfamiliar with the source material as I am, you might want to give this clunker a wide berth.",7
The Witcher,Awesome.must watch it. Absolutely best fight sequences.,10
The Witcher,The witcher is everything you need it the best series so far,10
The Witcher,"They had an amazing story, instead they did a GOT season 8, made is so confusing and just plainly stupid. This is a great story, but it was always cursed with inepts trying to adapt it to any movie, TV show. Wish HBO got the rights for that, Netflix just did another mediocre crap from a truly epic tale!",1
The Witcher,"Lately, we've gotten used to series that have the same production value of big budget movies. The Witcher is more along what you would have expected a TV show to look like, albeit 10 years ago this would have been extremely good quality for a TV show.Therefore it isn't bad per se. Actors, script and cinematography are along the lines of tv shows, not movies. We've simply been sploilt by ridiculously good, quality series lately.",7
The Witcher,"On December 20th,the Witcher scored 9.8 on IMDb.
Must be a mistake (I thought)
To be honest, after one episode, I was somewhat disappointed.
After three episodes I was hooked!
This is without a doubt a Masterpiece!
Its straight on rough, with brilliant graphics and storyline.
Netflix scored again with this ""must see"" series.",10
The Witcher,I am not even going to comment on the issue of people comparing this to GOT ... That comparison is irrelevant for me. I have been waiting for this series for months and was not disappointed in the least. It isn't difficult to see that 2 timelines are in effect for the season meeting in the last episode... I personally love they way that was done so that we get to see everything leading up to the point of the season as well as the current timeline. Things will get going hard come the next season I think. This whole project was done incredibly well and I am looking forward to the continuation of the series! The acting and effects are spot on as well as the soundtrack and everything else! If you are a fan of the book series then definitely give it a chance and even if you are not familiar with the novels you can get into the show. This is one of those times when I really wish that the season was longer. Waiting for a year for season 2 is just too much! I would definitely recommend this to anyone that is interested in fantasy and mythological type stories.,10
The Witcher,I'm a long time fan of the game and the original series. Let me just tell you that Geralt's character is only a supporting actor in this show. The show is clearly about empowered Mary sues namely Ciri ana Yeneffer. Geralt hardly gets any screen time and his story is completwly ignored other than fighting monsters and sex scenes . This show wreaks of feminism and propaganda. If you're a true fan of the books or the game or even the original TV show I suggest you to steer clear,1
The Witcher,"This is REALLY good. From battle scenes to cinematic to settings and stories, it's made me very nostalgic to the games. And even if you've never played them, the show doesn't even need you to have background context so not to worry from that point.",10
The Witcher,"There is only two good things about this show.
1. Casting of Roach is good.
2. Henry Cavill acting really good.Everything else is mediocre. Casting is really bad it's a slav based lore.Yet they put black evles, Indian Yennefer, black Fringilla etc. Because of casting tv show feels like generic Netflix teenshow.I don't recommend this show to anyone who love Witcher universe.",3
The Witcher,Apart from the picture everything is wrong. Bad actors and bad story. Henry is awful in this caracter. What is wrong with his voice btw?? I don't understand why this high rate.,3
The Witcher,"I like the pilot and how they interduce yenn & ciri. Also, I love the acting of henry as geralt. I am sure that season 2 will be better.",10
The Witcher,"Being the first season, it is depicting individual, stories and timeline collisions. The acting is very good, so much so that we can forgive the horrible character development of Superman by Henry Cavill. I love the sprinkle of humor and the fact that some of the actors are of Slavic origins.The show left me amazed and sleepy after bingeing the entire season in one sitting.The only cons I have seen is the VFX in some scenes was pretty bad and the kid from the band in the background doesn't know how to play the hurdy-gurdy.",10
The Witcher,"Disappointment, what else should we expect from Netflix anyway? Not sure if they are familiar with the Slavic folklore and that they should at least know that in that time there were no people of color but in show is clearly shown that there is nothing but different cultures/races. Show is boring, it's a shame that Yen is not a white girl with black hair and Geralt himself doesn't have yellow cat look like eyes, instead, his eyes are orange. Looks like they didn't put too much effort when it comes to costumes and people who are going to bring The Witcher characters alive on the screen. Disappointing.Edit: Triss is not a redhead like she is supposed to be.",1
The Witcher,"Just finished watching the season. Boy, must I say that whoever is going to watch it is in for a good one.
The casting, fight scenes and the music, wow! They've adopted many of the short stories from the first two books and they are very well thought out. Adding the background stories of Yennefer and Ciri is much appreciated. Looking forward to season 2.
Now, is it worth it? Of course, it's a nice story and Netflix weren't kidding about this one.
One thing I must say though, the show could be slightly confusing to follow when you get to midseason, before and after annotations would have been appreciated as the whole season follows two timelines (I won't spoil it).",10
The Witcher,"Haha this show is hilariously bad.
The witcher cant do anything without grunting like a macho stupid. Every dialogue is truly hilarous with the worst writing i have ever seen. when in the first episode theyre are gryning to explain and make shoutouts to every beastiary i n witcher lore. Its so funny. And when the party happens in the first one. Why are the The King and queen whispering. Every scene is like whuuuut?? You ser this show for one thing Only. Blood and nudity. Thats about it.",1
The Witcher,"I love it its base on the witcher wild hunt game
Ciri Yanniffer very good acting",10
The Witcher,"I'm halfway through the season and I think that's enough for me... I don't understand what's going on at any given moment or even who are most characters suposed to be... perhaps you need to have read the books or played the games to get any of it... the show has potential but the bad acting and nonsensical characters make it too boring to be worth it...
It's nothing like GOT, at least nothing like the first seasons of GOT, there isn't any character developement or intrigue, in that sense I suspect this is an adaptation of the videogames rather than the books... just cheap CGI battles and the ""story"" as a deep background for people who are familiar with it and can recognise it.... otherwise complete nonsense...
Nowadays a lot of this big tv shows and movies seem written and produced by 10 year olds... or for 10 year olds....",1
The Witcher,"The show takes you to key parts of Geralt's life, with massive back and Firth's in time that can seem confusing at first but pays off in the end if you watch that far, Geralt is one of three main characters, Yennifer being the second and Ciri the third, each going through their own journeys and timeline before arriving at the same time at the end of the series. Geralt and Yen get the most screen time and Ciri isn't as fleshed out as I'd like in terms of character development, it felt like they didn't know what to do with her in the show other than keeping her on the move.Geralt uses some signs, mostly Aard and Yrden, there will be times when the others could have been used but wasn't, you will find yourself repeating Axii or Igni at the screen. Geralt's sword skills are amazing as expected of a Witcher and he can ""sense"" some magics, such as at the beginning, which is nice to see the medallion working and not just an accessory. Would have been nice to see some more monster hunting, maybe a ""damn your ugly"" during a fight once or something.Monsters, a massive part in the Witcher world, are not as common as I would have liked, with most necrophages looking very similar, it would also have been cool to get some different types of monster, since we don't really see any beasts, spirits, one insectoid that Geralt doesn't see, no vampires. It just seems a little bare. We see dragons, but the CGI looks pretty bad.Yennifer's story is very much an origin at first, which personally I didn't like but you might, since it's like giving Gandalf a origin, just let them be powerful almost inhuman without the need for constant humanising. Look at what Yen does at the end for proof.
She starts off a ugly cripple with self confidence issues and a hint of magic, she brute forces her way past her own trials after almost constant failure and becomes a beautiful and powerful woman, very manipulative at first, if you don't know where she ends up you might even see her as hostile towards Geralt at first.
She has very little loyalty to the brotherhood and the other council mages and that whole group, looking to find a cure for what she did years ago.
She meets Geralt where time jumps make it hard to follow, long story short, they have been bumping into one another for years, on and off because of Geralt and it doesn't come through clearly enough when they are talking about leaving one another.Triss doesn't look like triss and it's off putting. Majorly at first but still less so down the line. Even though I'm team Yen I very much felt triss got done dirty more than Yen's casting, she's also too timid compared to what we are used to.Human enemies. Oh boy. The Nilfgaardian armour is awful. We get conflicting sources about how the designers purposefully made them look like to take a stab at the patriarchy and shouted down those that opposed and others that quote from the books a poorer Nilfgaard armour. Either way, it should probably be changed to the richer, more regal armour in future seasons.
Other Humans are pretty authentic, there are your common peasants that look like peasants, knights in plate armour and we even see a couple of elves.
We don't see Geralt fighting dwarfs? dwarves? So that's a shame. We don't really see dwarfs fighting at all to be honest, just being loud with one stabbing someone in the back. Ok.Ciri felt a little underwhelming, she can scream but the first time goes on a little too long as for some reason they slow motion it like we wouldn't know what she was doing if they didn't. The runs a lot, walks a lot, fights a Doppler that interacts with her about as much as it does with the one who hired it, she either needed to be fleshed out, or something but other than that, the casting for her was good, I felt like it was actually Ciri.The season ends rather abruptly, after it finished I was like ""what, no, that can't be it"" so I'm sad I'm probably going to have to wait ages for season 2, overall a great introduction which can be improved later on.",9
The Witcher,"The Netflix adaptation of The Witcher is a dark tale that is often somewhat hard to follow. Showrunner Lauren S. Hissrich based the show on the books by Andrzej Sapkowski and is very different from the computer games that we all love.TV shows such as Spartacus, Vikings and Game of Thrones have risen the bar for graphic violence and nudity, two things that we all loved about the game and sadly is lacking from the show.Cavill's portrayal of the charismatic monster slayer is very disappointing, his frequent grunts and brooding looks just aren't enough to capture the man that we all know Geralt to be.Chalotra had the hardest job playing the extremely voluptuous and sexy sorceress. Her portrayal of the earlier years of Yennefer were interesting however, we are soon introduced to her ""full self"" and sadly she lacked all the finer qualities of the character that we were all so drawn to.The show also jumps between different timelines which don't appear to be in any order. When we are introduced to a new character in the show we are often thrown off whether this is in the past, present of future.The show is worth a watch but hard core fans of the books and games will be slightly disappointed due to the lack of content and poor casting choices.7/10",7
The Witcher,If you are a fan of the witcher you will like it very much but if you are not a fan it will still be good but not awesome ??,10
The Witcher,"I read the books, I played the games. The TV show fits in somewhere.
After this year disappointments it's a welcomed surprise.But I think ( just like the Mandalorian ) it's a little bit overrated. For the same reasons. Those who were disappointed by SW in the last years, saw the Mando as a savior. Those who were disappointed by GoT finale see this as a savior too and rushed in to click 10/10 without too much thinking.However this show has nothing to do with GoT, other than being same fantasy genre. GoT was a psychological series with deep plots and schemes, with empathy on human interactions ( and one big fight per season to please some fans ). This one is more like Xena or Hercules, but a little bit darker.There is a lot of room for improvements, the show can evolve a lot. it's a good start and this will help.
But it's only a start. Time will tell.",7
The Witcher,"This TV show is a mix of brilliant (Geralt, Ciri), mediocre (Yen, Jaskier) and horrible (Fringilla, Triss, Foltest) casting. Fringilla is from Toussaint, not Zerrikania, there are neither Zerrikanian elves nor Zerrikanian generals in Cintra. Triss has obviously skipped her body transformation classes in Aretuza and has been aging fast ever since. All these and many more other inaccuracies are stopping this show from being great.",1
The Witcher,"I just wanna say to critics, if y'all done reviewing The Witcher then you all can go shut yourselves!",10
The Witcher,"Stop comparing Witcher with Game of Thrones? Yes. They were both based on books and they are both fantasy and both great. That's it. Stop comparing furtherNow for the show. Absolutely brilliant. The fine touches and details that show the timeline is insane. I like being a little bit challanged and not watch as a braindead a show. The timeline is really simple if you just pay a little bit of attention. I won't spoil things but man, who cannot understand is clearly not fit for the story. The casting is great! I was afraid for Ciri and Yennifer but i was so wrong! They are nothing like in the trailer! Geralt is perfect, even the voice is perfect, costume perfect, fighting stances and moves, perfect. For someone who read the books, i can say is exactly how i imagined when i was reading. This is something! They respected to books so good, i've never been so proud about a show.Give it love and support cuz there is a lot more coming!",10
The Witcher,"The characters are ridiculous, the dialogues are degenerate, you are gonna call me racist but Black Elves? Black Fringille, Black Istred? Asians and blacks in Medieval Slav Fantasy? Really? Ridiculous! Disappointment.
Triss is like 40 something? Ridiculous! I'm fricking upset.
P.S.: I'm not racist. I'm asian.",4
The Witcher,"I tried, but after 3 episodes I couldn't take anymore. Don't even waste your time giving it a go.",1
The Witcher,"After i have finished with a video game The Wild Hunt which is in my opinion the best video game of all times there has been a big hole to fill and this TV show gave me that fix :)I would like to thank the whole Witcher team and Netflix for giving us this awesome experience, you guys rock!See y'all in 2021 ;)",10
The Witcher,It's a good show. Just don't compare it to game of thrones,8
The Witcher,"I am writing this review only because I found reviews from outlets such as EW completely misguided (totally agree with E. Kain's article in Forbes). The Witcher is a dark high fantasy series, not easily edible by all. It is a rich world and no it is no GoT, since it does not seem to aim to become one. H.Cavill really embodies Geralt of Rivia, as well as A. Chalotra, who plays Yennefer. The world building and the costumes, are really good, even though some of the creatures could be better designed (especially the dragons, which were of Xena's and Hercules' production aesthetic from way back in the '90s). All-in-all a magnificent show. Can't wait for season 2.",9
The Witcher,I have seen some guys wrote review and they only watched first episode in addition they gave 1/10. Its very funny. Maybe the characters were chosen wrong and they do not fit well but it does not deserve 1/10. Before writing review watch all episodes please. Do not review for only bad actors chosen. None of the TV series deserves 1 point. Do not be hater.,10
The Witcher,"Im a quite big fan of the fantasy genere so I was excited when I found this.
I must say that I didnt know about the books or videogames before and their huge fan base and that explains the 9+ stars rating... or not.
The show is bad. Bad acting, bad scripts, bad effects, bad everything... and incredible boring. I gave it a 4 episodes try based on the rating of the show here... but I can't no more.
Now I really want to read the books, to check if the story is good. Because if it is I cant understsnd the Fan hype on this bad show.",4
The Witcher,Jsut like playing a video RPG love it!!! cant wait for season 2!! hopefully next is divinity original sin 2 !! please!!,10
The Witcher,After watching the first season I can definitely say I wasn't impressed with the first two episodes. I was more often thinking about how much more I enjoyed game of thrones. After I watched the third episode I was blown away! I got absorbed in the world the way this genre is supposed to grab your attention. I don't understand the negative reviews I think it's a great show and I can't wait to see a streamlined season 2!,9
The Witcher,"Review coming from a huge fan of the games and book, I think as usual both the 1 and the 10 start ratings everywhere should just be ignored, it's obviously not that bad and obviously not perfect.First off, the great for me:Henry Cavil, a huge surprise for me, he is amazing as Geralt, and there were a lot of his scenes where I could just as well thing his is straight our of the games, that's how well he plays Geralt.Joey Batey as Jaskier, another standoff, I think he did an amazing jobsome of the action scenes are excellentThen, for the good for me:I think Freya Allan overall did a good job as CiriAnya Chalotra for the most part does a great job as Yennefer as well and there are scenes which you could put straight into The Wild HuntMyAnna Buring as Tissaia is also greatLastly, the bad for me:The forced 'wokeness' just broke the world building for me and felt really out of place (black Fringilla ? black dryads? indian Vilgefortz? Why would they think this would not break the immersion?). This will of course not be a problem if you never played the games or read the books, but for me forcing in so many characters of color in what is suppose to be a medieval Poland setting and an already defined world from all the books and games is just unnecessary and a stupid Hollywood forced cliche at this point.I know that the characters have some very distinct and 'strong' eyes, but I found a lot of the scenes they hugely exaggerate with this probably for the 'new audience' sake, and I just found it way too distracting and off-putting (this applies in some scenes to all of Geralt, Yen and Ciri).There are some parts where the CGI feels cheap (although for the most part I think it's done very well).",7
The Witcher,"For fans of the series, and newcomers:The story might seem confusing in the beginning, but stick through and everything will make sense after a while. Brilliant performances, with spectacular visuals. An absolute must see.Exited for what's to come.",10
The Witcher,"So, I heard the ""Professional Critics"" had issues with this series. I'm not sure why. Not sure why we even care. Honestly, I would be willing to bet my resume for being a critic is better than most critics. But, I digress.......This started off in a strange place, to be honest. It's a bit confusing as you see the stories start for the main players. The pace is pretty good for the most part, you do get a few slower moments, but it's really just because of needed details. What's really strange is when they slowly start to bend the three main storylines and you realize that what you've been watching hasn't been all in the same timeline. That really caught be because I was thinking back to how I thought Ciri was the daughter of Renfri. It only made sense since the Queen has her grand daughter and the daughter was nowhere to be seen. Then you had the ""Fooled You"" moment as the stories began to merge. That bit of juggling of time might have made the plot more interesting so any plot slowness feelings were removed by the resetting of facts in my mind and the new mysteries to solve like, ""How in the hell does the Witcher end up with Ciri?"" Of course, like so many other people, I thought it was going to be the ""Girlfriend/Wife"" status with the whole ""Law of Destiny"" twist. It took me a bit to figure out the timelines merged when the battle happened at the castle.The overall plot is pretty good. I enjoyed the story and the plot twists. The characters are very interesting and I felt like I was getting the correct emotions of Love'em and Hate'em for the appropriate characters. How can you not like a movie with a hulked up Henry Cavill with magic killing all kinds of monsters and fighting for the weak?!When I said this is an ""Origin Story"" it was because it's obvious this was all a setup of the main characters and the main storylines. It can't really be missed because the entire series ends with Geralt finding Ciri, or maybe it's they find each other, in the woods just outside of the battle between the North and Nilfgaard. I didn't read the books, but just about everyone that did seems to think they didn't do this final scene justice. For me, it was fine, but it was really abrupt and............I could put many cuss words here, but the gist is, ""They finally find each other and then you end the damn thing!!! What the hell?!?!"" Way too much 'Cliffhanger' on this one. But, I'll be back so they did their job.Another thing to notice is the cinematography. The scenery in this one is really awesome to behold. They did a good job of capturing some very beautiful and large places that worked well with the storyline.Finally, the acting was good all around. Cavill was pretty awesome as the Bruding  Hero that always seems to do or say the right thing, but is constantly caught up in situations he didn't choose. Even the ""Law of Destiny"" was really just a backhanded joke while trying to leave. LOL. I kind of felt bad for him in that ""Ew! Yeah, you told a bad joke and it backfired!"" kind of way.I can't wait for Season 2 which seems to be setup for more than a year away...........Guess I'll have to rewatch this in a year!",8
The Witcher,"Masterpiece with the story telling, timeline, production?????????? Henry is the right choice. Ciri is another right touch, Jennifer got me as well, I guess if I really had to point one thing it would be Triss hair colour.
Congratulations to everyone involved.",10
The Witcher,"Cheesy acting, cheesy music, plot all over the place. Overhyped and woke!",2
The Witcher,"If you can survive the awful scoring, editing, and script writing in the first episode, the second and third are decent.",4
The Witcher,"The Witcher is an odd one - Cavill is so darn good, that you want to watch more, the rest of it reminds me of one of those old Hallmark TV mini-series. They seem to have spent their entire CGI budget on Cavill's scenes which is probably a good thing seeing as he's the only one that is good to watch. All in all, it's an okay thing to watch on a weekend where you haven't got anything else to do, but the producers let this down something fierce, it could have been great with better casting and better acting and better CGI and a better sequence to hold the plot together and perhaps more character and story development. So yeah, could have been better.",6
The Witcher,"Cavil and the cast knock it out of the park, every fight scene was beautiful choreographed. So many nods to the novels and the games. There are things in there that were neither novel or game related and i was fine with it. completely blindsided me how good this was.",9
The Witcher,Totally amazing serial....nvr get bored... dont listen to bad comments..see for yrself...,10
The Witcher,First season was amazing. The story has just begun.,10
The Witcher,"The series starts confusingly, but if you are willing to suspend your disbelief and trust in the show, it pays off in spades. Henry Cavill gives a great performance as the titular Witcher Geralt, somehow both inhabiting the physicality and leaden character of the video games (with its inexpressive face) and elevating the role into something dramatic and expressive for big-budget television.",9
The Witcher,"I escape my work just to see it sdcind time....
its fantastic Looove it's",10
The Witcher,"Its not as bad as 1/10 or as good as 10/10.good parts: henry cavil, fight choreography and lot of locations are really good. dandelion is funny :Dbad parts: writing and character building is mediocre. wish they didnt cram so many major plot lines just in 1 season and took time in world building. (this is my major gripe and i am sure this why lot of people are having issue with the show )also show never tells how witchers and magic users dont age like normal people in the starting episodes but they use timejump story telling where henry and yenn looks the same in both the timeline. i think newcomers to the show will get confused.They did not do a good job with Yenn + geralt plotline. i never bought any of it and most of it makes no sense if u think in geralt's perspective in this show. they could have spent more time on it developing that arc as its really important. as a result there was no chemistry between those 2.costume design and CGI is mixed bag for me. nilfgardian armor is pretty much a joke and might annoy lot of people. sword fights and simple human battles are really well made but monster fights are hit or miss.i honestly thought they could have avoided lot of spectacle and saved budget in 1st season and setup the world lot better than this.",1
The Witcher,It's the 'Pulp Fiction' of a fantasy genre. You will feel rewarded by its unique and bold storytelling.,10
The Witcher,"Yeah I'm one of those guys who think GOT is overrated .... but let's get to the point and keep it brief .... it's dark, more violent, deep, intense, bit of politics and CGI is good but not great .... much more for complicated for people who haven't read the books or played the game ..... the only problem is they have emphasised the destiny part too much ....",4
The Witcher,"I've read books, I'm a fan of video games (especially the 3rd part). So, after binge-watching the entire season 1, I'm really sad to admit that the Witcher TV series is a major disappointment. The root cause of most problems with the series is, without a doubt, bad writing. It is because of poor writing that fantasy series with a great storyline, huge fanbase and developed universe still feels like a B- grade TV production. No matter how much money Netflix has poured into the Witcher series, the lack of character building, the plot-jumping, the laughably unrealistic dialogues - all of it makes it nearly impossible to enjoy the show.",8
The Witcher,I've never played the games or read the books. This show is just amazing. I hope season 2 comes out soon.,10
The Witcher,"You just dont need to invent a wheel if you got no talent. Word to word adaptation would be much better. Also, bad writing is not the only problem of the show, sadly. Geralt, Jaskier and Roach looked above average, though ALL of the cast members should blame the writers and producers for not letting them to be likeble. As a fan i am very dissapointed, i was waiting for this show for too long and now i feel robbed.",1
The Witcher,Never wanders away from the story. Just as it should be. The camera and storyline is on point and recreates the same atmosphere as the original game. 10/10,10
The Witcher,"Altought you have to understand the games or the books to watch this, I strongly recommend it if you love fantasy medieval timeline and action genre. Its like a GoT, Lord of the Rings genre tv series... and it absolutly blasts! Amazing performance from Henry Cavill and very good plot",10
The Witcher,I really like the genre and Heard- about the story before. But it's honestly nonsense from plot side. I will finish the Season only for the hope to understand this bull!,4
The Witcher,"Despite all the controversy over the cast and bad feedback from some xenophobic, disrespectful fans, The Witcher is a great experience to both fans and new guys. Those who have read the books will understand the course of events. Those who havent, well, the TV series made their best to explain literally on fingers about what's happening, without breaking the atmosphere. I was really pleased by Henry Cavill's acting, he did an amazing Geralt voice, that is similar to Doug Cockle (Geralt's voice actor in the games).I'm not gonna spoil the plot, it would be disrespectful, but i can say that the series is pretty good at turning book plot into the screen, It's much, much better made that previous adaptation of Witcher (a horrid Polish TV series, very embarassing), and it can be seen, that The Witcher is made by people who were passionate about this wonderful universe, like Cavill himself. Considering the fact,that author himself, Andrzej Sapkowski was pleased with this adaptation. and he is a kind of critic that is much harsher that all this inferior ""specialists"" from Rotten Tomatoes or Metacritic.I can also add, that it has naturally realistic graphics, and GGI is actially awesome. Magic looks really pretty, not overly epic and flashy, which could make it wacky, and monsters, like kikimore at the beginning is actually scary for me and has quite disgusting vibes, that i had in the games.I rate Netflix's The Witcher with 10/10 because it is exactly i waited for and not even Nilfgaardian armor can spoil me the pleasure, considering the fact that they already hired another costume manager for season 2. I approve of this series and hope that all of you, who wants to watch it - just watch it. Don't read the critics - RotTom and Metacritic and other like IGN. Have your own opinion and just let youself sink into the atmosphere with a little patience and calm mind, that is open to new experiences. I wish you all good fortune in the reviews to come.",10
The Witcher,"Fan of the game, behind all expectations.
Too bad season 2 is so far ahead.",10
The Witcher,"Compared to Horrible TV Show Gotham, The Witcher follows more or less How Charakters and Story was mentioned to be: Quite pure and by a strong cultural Knowledge about clothing, Surrounding and Mentality of Europes dark Ages; it's a huge difference and Need to have this background of just Imagine it from a average US perception...So, being one of best Games ever - cause of this facts - The Witcher TV Shows is pretty close to the Book. BUT, be warned: There are already some signes of getting intrigued by Holywood Crap: A kind of cheap loR imitations and gender issue (little princess complexes/minority gender issue nonsens). This IS NOT what community of The Witcher wants, producer shall mind this! Keep this political over correctness issues for US and Sweden if needed at all. Main actor could be more mature of age, the Witcher looks like a grown man of 40s with excellent fighting skills and even a bit more sarcasm at some points. But again, first throw was a pretty good one. Let's hope the US influences don't crashes to good heading...",2
The Witcher,Perfect czech dabing.I am looking on it whole the day. Again and again.,10
The Witcher,"I think much of the story has been written from the perspective that only fans of the games or books will even watch it.Not much explanations of the characters or places.It's not bad from a purely visual or quality perspective but the story is thinner than water.Every time Geralt shows up, people recognize the monsterhunter, the awesome fighter, and treat him like he is excrement. Only for him to most of the time totally annihilate any opposition.Henry Cavill is fine as Geralt though. The actress portraying Yennefer too.This could have been soo much better.",6
The Witcher,"As somebody who hasn't read the books or played the games, for once I'm not influenced by the comparisment. So if I have to make a review solely based on the show itself, I have to say: so far I'm deeply impressed. The world of the Witcher is one of darkness, mystery and evil...but sometimes there is good. The show portrays this perfectly. Next to that, there is an entire world to discover and a grander plot (call it the destiny of the main characters) to unveil. So far, I'm impressed by all of it, including the acting of most protagonists and antagonists. Bingewatching garuanteed!",10
The Witcher,"I watched the first three episodes before I took a look at the critical reviews. I couldn't believe how mixed the critical reviews were for a show of such high caliber. If you are a fan of the fantasy genre and can appreciate the rich story layering, you will thoroughly enjoy The Witcher. Following multiple characters across various time frames, the story weaves a rich tapestry that is truly emblematic of fantasy story telling done right. Perhaps what has jaded the critics, is that The Witcher hits much closer to the belt of traditional fantasy story telling with monster encounters happening much more frequently. It is certainly much more reminiscent of Robert W Howard's Conan stories than the socially accepted melodramatics that occur closer to the heart of Game of Thrones. I couldn't help but to think of failed tv adaptations of popular fantasy series such as The Shannara Chronicles and the tv series adapted from Terry Goodkind's epic fantasy. The Witcher works very well and it's creators understand the world Geralt lives in. Here's hoping it becomes a resounding success for Netflix, and serves as an example for the multiple fantasy adaptation on the horizon.",10
The Witcher,He is Beowulf. Beast so far so good almost like the Hercules series but lord of the rings esq.,8
The Witcher,"Gamers gave it a very high score even before they watched it. It is 8 hours show but after only 10 minutes of its debut I sow 9.8. Whatttt?
Its an average tv show that has been made to takes advantage of the game's success and to to seize the opportunity of GOT absence before there is another really good series filling the place.
Still waiting for Amazon's lord of the rings based series.",8
The Witcher,"The trailers sold it as a dark fantasy epic akin to Game of Thrones. Tonally, it's closer to the Sky Atlantic cheese-fest Britannia. Enjoyable enough but just not what was pitched to us (they said it would lean more into fantasy-horror, for one thing).",7
The Witcher,"Books and games are 10/10 for me. I don't think that adaption should be exact and I think that there is everything to made a TV-series far better than GoT (which is also 10/10 for me, except of 3 last episodes). But still this series is completely fails for me.Why this series is bad:1. Everything looks cheap. Details are not thought through, poor scripts, poor directing, poor CGI, fighting scenes are pathetic. Everything is so unrealistic in details. If someone doing a ""fantasy"" it should not mean that logic should be missing. This part was totally fine in books and games.2. Poor action. Witcher is all about fencing and battles, if you doing a series on him you should have a competent experts and stunts crew. Here it looks very bad and unrealistic, poor action choreography. Equips are bad and not realistic, armors looks like made of paper and it's pierced like paper (nobody would wear armor if it can be pierced like it's shown here many times).3. Bad casting. Especially of female characters. Triss is horrible in every possible way. Ciri's appearance is fine, but her acting is not impressive, she's not charismatic. How awesome visually their characters were depicted in the third game comparing to this...4. It's not sexy. They have bold sex scenes, but none of main female characters is very attractive or charismatic. In witcher lore the sorceresses all looks super hot because of magic. Here they aren't, like none of them. Instead they have attractive men characters, starting from pretty bodybuilder Geralt, who was rather ugly and scraggy in the books. Is it a result of creator and casting manager being female?5. Reduced gore? They avoiding too much gore or simply doing it very poor, which I really can't understand. Only one example among many: during massacre of Cintra it is shown that some nilf is slitting throat to some girl or woman, and it looks SO unrealistic. Compare it with how in GoT they killed in this way one the main characters.6. Too much of ""tolerance"". And too much focusing on problems of women struggle, etc. This backstory of Yen is completely unnecessary and made only for this purpose.",1
The Witcher,"I love the book series and have really enjoyed the show. It is a little bit chaotic in the beginning, but so were the original short stories. Maybe showing the current year and location at the bottom of the screen would help after a sudden chronological change, as viewers that are new to the show might be discouraged because of the disjointed timeline.The main cast is great. I had a lot of doubts when it came to the casting choice regarding Yennefer but after the 3rd episode everything snapped into place. Henry is pretty much perfect in his role, but they really had to use a lot of grime and dirt to make him not look like Superman :DThe fighting scenes with Geralt are perfect. Very fast, very precise and - as it were described in the books - the victims of a Witcher's blade really looked ugly. The other fighting is pretty much GoT standard. Fine, a little bit too much gore and bloody ""finisher moves"" where it was not needed at all.You can also see a lot of very strong artificial lighting, probably to hide some unwanted details that were there because of the lower budget. Let's hope it will be higher in the coming seasons.Obviously, it's not perfect yet, but it's a very good adaptation of the story, with some points where it was simply excellent and significantly above expectations.",10
The Witcher,"Talk about bought ratings. Even without looming giant of the games and books, the show in itself is ATROCIOUS! Horrible writing, bad acting, cheap CGI and costume design, music... composer tried to capture(copy) that feel from the games and failed miserably. Wokenisation is worse than in any other fantasy adaptation. Do not waste your time, better spend your money on games and books about true Witcher.",2
The Witcher,"The Witcher is a one of wonderful story-book in the world. Currently, this story is continuation of Cervantes Don-Kihot, which spoke about one people role in the all of world.
This role is very hard and has much philosophic questions and answers, a lot of problems mentioned inside.And now what we see in this story, started from Blaviken but without Thridamm? The story has absent the main part of the main story. We can't understand why Geralt has come and fight with Renfri. Simplest like a comics based stories for children we can see only action without a peoples inside.Looks like this is story based on the game but not on serious story-book.
And why we have so big rating value? Because the rating based on the game and peoples vote is part of game-story.The series has my rating 1 from 10 - because he only kills the possible good way to open Gerald's story for all of us, kills all book and just for fun of stupids to see another game instead the story.",1
The Witcher,"Interesting story, Henry is cool he's done this in immortals. Other actors so far are doing their job. So far so good as far as the story. Get over it GOT it's over. Watch 13th warrior he's almost the sam character.",8
The Witcher,For new comers...it will be a bit confusing for them...tho I'm sure that they will get it eventually in the final ep....I like how it's all lined up all together....but yeah...it will be a bit confusing for new comers without any knowledge of the books. But let's get to the point....this show is dark.... very dark...don't listen to those devils. Just watch it.,10
The Witcher,"If you went to watch it based on posts like Netflix's GOT and found it disappointing, you are like me. I too am unable to believe such high initial ratings based on the debacle I just witnessed.
No doubt high production value for Netflix, but it too got duped by screenplay writers and a medicore direction at best. Casting Henry Cavill will only give you initial viewers, if things continue this way this series can die down soon, so need to recover soon on those fronts as storyline seems to have potential.",5
The Witcher,Worst totally C class .. why netflix is pouring in millions for such C grade script.. totally boring and directionless kept waiting for something to happen waited till 6th episode gave it a thumbs down on netflix and will never ever watch the stupid witcher again.,1
The Witcher,"Don't give your score and go in watching with the mindset of comparing it to Game of Thrones. Just because it's fantasy doesn't mean it's the new Game of Thrones, The Witcher is it's own deal and has its own pace.As a huge fan of the games and read some of the short stories, Netflix has done an incredible job with the characters, story and dark tone and a lot of people giving it low scores like 1/10 and have no idea what The Witcher is setting up and the show is clearly not a 1/10.I think it's a 9 but I'll give it a 10/10 to try and combat the trolls who don't watch it at all and give it a 1 score straight away. Henry Cavill is the prefect choice for Geralt and the rest of cast is great too. Watched 8 episodes in one day cause I was hooked. Can't wait for season 2",10
The Witcher,"Wow, binge watched it and it was awesome. Cinematography is very good and those action scenes are on fire (sometimes literally lol) !
I understand why some people are disliked it that's because they had high expectations. I only wanted a simple episode by episode Geralt hunting monsters while the main plot evolves thing and series are far better than what I've wanted.
Solid 10/10 for me.",10
The Witcher,I'll be honest i thought i was not going to like it. I thought they were going to butcher the series boy i was never so wrong in my life. I watch the first episode on the edge of my seat. Henry Cavill was a great witcher but my favorite is Joey Batey as Jaskier. They were perfect.,10
The Witcher,"Whole first season is pretty good , but i hate non-chronological telling , who confused new watcher . sometimes bad CGI . serial dont have polish feel and soundtrack .
Futility Triss in story with strig and inaccuracies and omitted passages from books , but Geralt is fantastic , Marigord also , humor works , the foundations of the serial are solid 7/10",7
The Witcher,"Well, there is simply no comparison between these shows. whicle GoT has an amazing first season with unexpected plot, The Witcher seems to be carried our by most Henry Cavil.Nonetheless, Netflix made quite a show and Cavil playing Geralt is the best thing they did.The direction is Netflix-like but it's good.The theme was amazing and the graphics too.It clear that Netflix burnt quite a cash on producing this.There is magic, monsters, and battle but there is something missing in the show which doesn't make it equal to likes of GoT, talking about season 1.Still, the 8 episodes ride ended quite faster than I anticipated that means the show has a hooked plot.But I have high hopes for upcoming seasons as the story just started.",8
The Witcher,"So I didn't really want to write a review but here I go. The series is quite captivating for a person like me who has played the games. However, I can see where it comes short in introducing new fans to the story. The story is hard to follow in the beginning if you have no idea what The Witcher is all about but by the end the ends tie and it is satisfying. Great action, even better than GoT but worse writing for sure and you have to keep in mind that The Witcher story is quite more fantastical than Got. Overall it is a very good time and I would especially recommend it to people who like medieval fantasy stories. I give it 10/10 only because I've seen quite a lot of unwarranted 1/10s which is absolutely ridiculous. A more realistic rating in my opinion is 8.5/10. Great but not Perfect!",10
The Witcher,"This gritty fantasy series is based on the fantasy novels by Polish writer Sapkowski, already propelled to international fame by the masterful CD Projekt Red videogames.The eight-episodes first season is a solid beginning. People involved in the production have obviously done their homework, from the haunting soundtrack with its feral mix of vocals, guitar, strings and percussions (inspired by Wild Hunt's score) to details like Geralt's use of the Signs.Henry Cavill is a pleasant surprise as protagonist Geralt of Rivia, the titular ""Witcher"" (monster hunter), a sort of fantasy Man With No Name. Cavill is clearly a fan and effectively channels Doug Cockle's original performance, playing Geralt with the right mixture of world-weary cynicism and decency.Narrative is compelling but structure a little clunky in the first episodes, a result of cramming together a collection of different short stories about Geralt. Still, it builds up to a story with clearer forward momentum. A promising start.7,5/10",8
The Witcher,"This has the potential to be a great show. So far I'm impressed. Season 1 feels a little disjointed, but knowing the source material, it's understandable. Henry Cavill is Geralt of Rivia, Anya Chalotra clicked as Yennifer and Freya Allan has the potential to grow into her character. Some of the design of the monsters is questionable, but overall I very much enjoyed it.",9
The Witcher,"Overrated. The inconstancy of the shot quality mixed with overacting, cheap sets and cheese ball humour makes it hard to get fully absorbed.",6
The Witcher,"The show drops you right in and remains a watchable mess from start to finish. The astonishing production values make it. Trashy source material (this remixes 3 whole books!) it mostly adheres to but is randomly adapted via time jumps and mediocre acting and somewhat weird direction undo it. I may return for S02E01 to see if there will be a marked improvement but the longer the books go on the worse they get so I am not holding my breath. Those drown in casual rape as character development for the women and this version already got a head start on that in the pilot. Be warned in advance this is Trigger Warning - The Show.
About our anti-hero Henry Cavill. He is sadly miscast and delivers a meh performance that is neither book (he is a bummer who is a side character in his own story) nor game (he is a revelation). Quality actor, wrong show. The whole cast is kind of a mess and misses the point of the source material I would argue. The critic got it right this time. I was considering giving this a very weak 6/10 due to my knowledge of the game/book canon which was the only reason I could follow along but I plainly stopped having any fun by the time the storylines somewhat converged at the end and such a dramatic show shouldn´t leave anyone with apathy. Play the games instead. They start a bit rough but end in greatness and stay away from the books. 5/10PS: This is obviously better made than the 2001/2 adaptation but that one is at least easy to follow and bothers to explain what a Witcher and Geralt are early through an origin story. Keep Wikia open at all times for this one!",5
The Witcher,I think the writers did an amazing job adapting this fantasy tale to the small screen. The episode style is reminiscent of the quest system of the 3 hit games and the story has the depth and characterization of the books.,10
The Witcher,"The music, Cavilles voice, the scenes... Warm chills and related to the game. Some details missing but otherwise just... wow.",9
The Witcher,Not great...not terrible. Ending was bad tho...who will wait till 2021...,7
The Witcher,"Don't mind me, just an over the top fanboy.I loved every God damn second of it. There was not a single boring moment I had an urge to skip unlike other shows. I was soo afraid of coming to IMDB and see a low rating BUT EVERYONE LIKES IT.OMG, YES!!!!! Ive never been so into a series before, perhaps it is because I'm already so heavily invested in the characters from the books but I can't quacking wait for the next season so I can binge that one as well.Life is finally worth living??",10
The Witcher,"I already know the story and the characters, and I have to say I appreciated how the authors of this serie managed to build it.
That said, this is more of a feedback for them so that they'd know the parts that I didn't like:1. Nilfgaardian armors are terrible, truly truly terrible. I don't really know how you could accept something like that.
2. Dryads: they've basically nothing of the Dryads from the books or the games, I understand that you had to compromise but that's a very poor and cheap compromise.
3. Yennefer: perfect start, but the way you closed her ""characterisation"" could have been better.So for the 1. and 2. I hope the budget for the next seasons would allow you to have a more balanced production quality, which is high in some places but discomforting in others.That said, keep up the good work ;)",9
The Witcher,I am completely satisfied with everything! Such a great series. Geralt is great. Settings are original and capturing. Plot line is well design. Monsters are scary. Please just keep the quality!,10
The Witcher,"And I just deleted it.I imagine that all these downvotes are from IMDB users after Season 2 before Season 3.The incoming Season 3 will be the last season for Henry Cavill starring as Geralt. Netflix should REALLY just end it there, because there is no show without Henry Cavill. His portrayal of Geralt is legendary, and no matter how good of an actor the follow-up may be, it just won't work.I cannot believe that Netflix allowed Henry Cavill to leave the show while retaining Lauren Schmidt as the showrunner. It really shows you where Netflix is at right now. This man loves and respects the lore, and you can see it clear-as-day in interviews, behind-the-scenes snippets, and his pitch-perfect turn as the titular Witcher. If the rumors of what went down are to be believed, then much of the production team constantly dunked on the source material while labeling Cavill as little more than a toxic male gamer who didn't understand the artistic vision of the show.I don't even subscribe to speech which unfairly labels people for the purpose of slander, but really? Sure, Cavill is a gamer, but isn't the PRIMARY factor contributing to The Witcher's existence on Netflix actually the 2015 game Witcher 3: Wild Hunt? And Toxic? Henry Cavill? The same guy that every other production team says is a passionate gentleman?Given the look, feel, and story of Season 2, my guess is that the tale told by Cavill is more accurate. The production team mocked Cavill, the source material, and gamers as a whole while still intending to shove their own agendas, plots, and characters into an already complex narrative. They already had the benefit of years of books and games, but they didn't respect that material or the person who was desperately trying to respect it in their place.So, they ran off their star, failed at a spin-off, lost all fan support, and season 3 will most likely be the nail in the coffin.All that said, I do still cautiously recommend this show for casual viewing as ADHD-background noise. It has really solid acting all-around, particularly by Henry Cavill as Geralt. There are some fun stories here, and some pretty visuals. Season 2 is definitely not near as good as the amazing Season 1, but it does have an increased monster count and some fun Geralt scenes.Overall, as of Season 2, it's a 5/10 fun ride, but just know that the direction of this show is straight into the ground. It's DOA, and I won't be watching season 3 or updating this review further unless the showrunners are fired and Cavill is brought back as a producer/story consultant. Since I don't really see a reality where that's happening, I suspect this will be the final sad iteration of this review.",5
The Witcher,"First of all, I've read the books and played the games several times. Geralt is my all time favorite game character and I also love Yennefer. I was so excited for this show and maybe my expectations were to high...It's not a bad show. Henry Cavill is awesome as Geralt. And I really like the casting of Dandelion and Ciri. The fight scenes are great and I love the look of Geralt casting signs.The problem for me is that I find it all so incredibly boring! I just don't care about the story or any the characters. It might be because I already know alot of the story, but it should be exciting to see how the show executes it and what they keep or change. But it just doesn't. It's almost like they try too hard to make me feel for the characters, but everything is happening so quickly and I don't feel invested in anything.For me it's not the acting. I think it's more the pacing, the script and the editing. The pacing is all over the place and the episodes are too long. The script is cringey at times and I feel like they repeat things too much. We know Witchers are looked down on by humans. We know Yennerfer feels worthless. They don't have to repeat it again and again in the same episode.I also feel like the costumes could have been a lot better. I'm sure they had a limited budget, but honestly it looks a little ridiculous. Everyone looks like they're in a play and should be on a stage. The costumes doesn't blend with the environment and takes my focus away from what is happening story wise. When you watch a movie or a tvshow, the costumes should feel authentic to the characters, and not stand out in a distracting way. Hopefully this will get better as we get more seasons, as this happens with alot of tvshows.I don't love it, but I'll still give season 2 a shot. It definitely has alot of potential and maybe it's a show that needs to grow on me with time.",5
The Witcher,"As a big fan of both Witcher books and games, I can say this series can be quite complicated for someone who does not know much about the games or books. Most of the events in the series are important to the general story, so there is no minor scenes that can help the viewer rest a bit. She/he must pay clear attention. The storyline is also complicated, an event that is before another is seen actually after that event. I personally had no problem with this storyline but as I said someone new to the universe can have Hard times trying to adapt it. However the series definetely sticks to the first two books and they did not change the Major events as they wish any way whatsover. You can see they sticked faithful to the original story metarial.
Geralt is portrayed almost perfect and Henry Cavill did a fine job. But the problem is, just like when he portrayed Superman, he also portrayed Geralt quite dark and melancholic. Indeed it is true that Geralt is rather a dark character, but NOT all the time. He likes to have fun in an inn from time to time, laughing, drinking and women also :D The good side about him is that his voice tone is very close to Geralt's and his fight scenes indeed make you say that this is a WITCHER.
Casting is a bit undecent, I cant say all the actors are doing a fine job.... I wish the game series was more slavic rather than American.
Lastly, the clothing and armor could have been much better. I personally did not like Yennefer's, Triss' and many other characters' costumes. Nilfgaardian armor is definetely not pleasant to the eye. In the game, Not only Nilfgaardian but all the armor look just perfect.
Overall I think that this series deserves 7/10. It is not very good, but good.",3
The Witcher,"The Witcher is a magical universe like Lord of the Rings but presented to a much more mature audience like Game of Thrones. The only problem is though is that the show was directed and presented in a similar fashion as the TV Show, Arrow, with constant flashbacks but while Arrow identified the flashbacks The Witcher doesn't. These frequent poorly identified flashbacks come across as potential decade long time warps between episodes and it is very chaotic and totally destroys the enjoyment.The only thing I have enjoyed about this show was the sword fighting at the end of episode 1. It was well done like Hector fighting Achilles in Troy and it was awesome. It started with such a high note and here I am at Episode 7 and nothing has hit that original high note ever since.",1
The Witcher,"I haven't played the game or read the books and watched it like any other fantasy.
We learn that crossbows exist, but only once during that one badass scene desperately trying to be ""The Punisher"".
Slow-mo magic and kiss.
Editing is certainly out of this world because it cannot be explained why would anyone do that.
Amazingly cringy monologues all the way through all episodes.
Cavils voice and manner of speech is 1:1 when Star Lord tries to be tough in front of Thor.I don't know, maybe it's just not my cup of tea but it looks like this is just all those annoying NPC speeches and cinematics that you skip during the game crammed together.",3
The Witcher,Its nice i prefer to all of you to watch it 10/10 the story is nice the actors are brilliant i wish they continue more episodes in the future,10
The Witcher,"The special effects, the acting, the wardrobe, the storylines, the build up, the mystery.It's all amazing.I love it. You'll love it.",10
The Witcher,"I'm never read ' The Witcher novel ' and never play ' The Witcher Game ' but my thought that very good show for me, Why ? > It's not slow but fast on the 1st episode. For me it's fair details about drama + action and character backgrounds ( I may buy the books and watch all episodes for more 2 - 3 rounds to catch up the details, Lol ). So all my idea is ' Love it '.",10
The Witcher,"Too much hype generated, Acting is really like for B series.",4
The Witcher,Igenuinely had high hopes for this show but the writing looks like it's made for a teenage audience. The costume design is below average for such an expensive production. It's disappointing since I have been a fan for a long time. What does need to be said is Henry Cavill was the only excellent character. The others are alright but the bard needs to be killed off. Jaskier made the show unwatchable.It also needs to be noted the extreme amount of faux reviews on this Page. Look at the users and their writing. Almost bot like. It looks like someone paid a lot to make this show look ultra appealing. All the perfect reviews are from Hardcore fans that planned on bombing the reviews with 10/10 score on Discord so watch out.,1
The Witcher,"While the production values are suitably high, that's undoubtedly the best thing one can say about The Witcher. One would have thought that after 8 seasons of Game of Thrones Netflix would have collected some pointers about what's needed to build a realistic and believable world, but apparently they forgot to take notes or just never watched it.While the production is of a suitably high quality, the whole thing reads as a historically illiterate American's uninspired take on Eastern European Late Medieval period. The sets are nice, but they don't look lived in. Rather they look like what they are: movie sets. The costumes are nice too, but again they all too often look like costumes. They may be dirty at times, but they too don't look ""lived in"".The dialogue is awful, just awful. Exactly no effort whatsoever appears to have been put into crafting believable colloquy. Full of modern colloquialisms it is about as immersion-breaking as can be. Likewise, Jaskier's songs lack any sense of coming from the repertoire of a medieval troubadour, sounding instead like those of a comedic american singer-songwriter suffering from a case of severe mediocrity.Nor does 2-day stubble, fancy contacts and long, grey hair transform Henry Cavill into a believable Geralt; he ends up rather like a less meek Clark Kent. While a sumptuous collection of scars have been plastered on his body, his overly chiselled features leaves no impression of a life full of constant hardship and tribulations.Without a doubt the two best and most compelling characters of this first season are Freya Allan as Ciri and Anya Chalotra as Yennefer of Vengerberg. Both charcters are interesting and well acted, but they are far from able to save the season by themselves. Various side shows also do a good job: Jodhi May can always be relied upon and makes a good Queen Calanthe, while Shaun Dooley's King Foltest is just right.Overall though, as someone who enjoyed the books and games a lot I found The Witcher a huge let-down.",3
The Witcher,"As far as I'm concerned the critic's are drinking Drano. This was captivating from beginning to end. The way they weaved the narrative together from the stories was incredible. If you have no knowledge of the material I can see how it would seem a little slow, or out there. Hang in because it's really good. Oh and everyone needs to stop with the GOT comparison's. It's apples and oranges. I see this show having a very long run. People like it and that's what matters not critic's.",10
The Witcher,"Couldnt understand anything.if you want to understand whats happening you have to play games first, they didnt explained anything...",5
The Witcher,"Excellent. Well thought out story, and excellent acting - the combination is explosive excellence.",10
The Witcher,Absolutely great series! Didnt expect it to be this good.,10
The Witcher,"I still don't like the race bending netflix decided to do with a few characters as I can never take the characters seriously but oh well...
The show is still phenomenal and I totally recommend it to witcher fans and medieval fans alike.",10
The Witcher,"Writing, acting and story fit together well. The action was great. Henry Cavil does an amazing job portraying Geralt. Overall great and am excited for season two.",10
The Witcher,I love game of thrones this is again another show of class what a charachters yeneffer is awesome and ciri is intresting aswel and geralt speaks for itselfs i dont compare books and games with the show didnt with game of thrones if your gonna compare everything you are not enjoying the show i like it that the writers make there own twst on it another great fantasy tv show i am hooked just awesome,10
The Witcher,"To be honest I never played the games etc.
So I am open minded by the story. This is the main problem for me. The viewer is overwhelmed with terms that are never explained at the beginning. This makes identification with this world very difficult. In contrast, Game of Thrones has an intro in which the world and the connections are made accessible to the viewer right from the start and thus involve him.
Otherwise a solidly made series which still has potential at the top.",7
The Witcher,"Henry cavill shines, but it's bloated, the acting is one note. The games are better.",4
The Witcher,"Anya Chalotra shows some amazing acting talent .
I hope they don't waste it on ''less intelligent '' roles .",10
The Witcher,"Can't believe the negative reviews. This show pleased my heart. I can't wait to see what they can do with an even bigger budget and with a more consistent focus on story now that the characters are all established.
Also the fight scenes are pure terror and joy",10
The Witcher,"I was so excited to start watching the series, but after the first 30 minutes I was so disppointed that I stopped. Maybe in a few days will try again.",1
The Witcher,"Despite having some cast issues the first season of show was pretty satisfactory. The episodes has a folk fairy tale air to them and the portrayal of the three main characters of these series of books, Geralt, Yennefer and Ciri, felt very true to the source material. Jasker's character was also very true to the book although his singing was a bit too modern at times. His interactions with Geralt were some of my favorite moments of the show.
The way the show was edited with different time lines withing the same episode reminded me of the way the books were written as well.The only two characters who I'm still not convinced are Triss and Fringilla. Triss actress lacked something on the acting department. Triss is somewhat of a little sister of sorts. Fringilla on the other hand was good acting wise but in the books she's supposed to look a lot like Yennefer and it matters further down the story.
Overall, I liked the show a lot. I've read the books and played the video games and this is a great addition for fans of the franchise.",8
The Witcher,"It reminds me of another flawless and amazing show that is game of thrones. The theme and the feel is almost the same and i love it, i truly think this will be big the same way GOT was.",10
The Witcher,Just wow it looks better then the game!! I can not wait to see the end of it!!:),10
The Witcher,"What more could you ask for?
Henry Cavill really loves this character and it absolutely shows. He gives it his all as Geralt and tries his best with the dialogue to make it his own. As for Yennifer and Ciri, they did a pretty good job! I can't wait to see what this does for their careers.The fighting scenes are outstanding, brutal and well choreographed. The cinematography is pretty great as well, nothing really stands out but the world they've created is beautiful at best.If you enjoy fantasy series like Game of Thrones or you enjoyed the books or the games than I think this will be a pleasant surprise for all who are watching.",9
The Witcher,One of the best tv series in this year. Don't miss this shiw,9
The Witcher,"This show is amazing. This is THE WITCHER!!!! The acting, set design, vfx, costume design is all top notch and the world building and character development is great. You could tell this show was made by fans of Andrezej Sapkowski acclaimed novels and of the lore and mythology of the world, in general.",10
The Witcher,"This is gonna go down as the best tv show ever even surpassing breaking bad. Wow, words can't describe how great this looks. Gotta give it up to netflix for creating this masterpiece",10
The Witcher,"For everybody who was sceptical about Henry Cavill, he nailed it! I played the witcher 3 game and have to say i didnt expect much, but i got a lot. The story, the clothes, the surroundings, wonderfull! Hope they bring out all 7 seasons they allready have written. Best way to start the holiday season, watch this and you won't regret it!",10
The Witcher,"One of, if not the best fantasy shows ever. Stands alone on it's own merit and cant be compared to anything, an amazing feat for this genre. The cast, crew, and everyone involved should be proud of this one. Cant wait to see more! Book readers will definitely be pleased in how they have chosen to adapt such a great story. 10/10 would recommend.",10
The Witcher,"Don't compare it with got. R.R Martin has created a different era and this is different and yes it deserves to be binged because of good story writing, exquisite cinematography and stunning caste.",9
The Witcher,"I bet playing witcher games helped henry to bring geralt of rivia on screens, but, this is different, yet better than geralt from games. I recommend this show to everyone who liked got because it feels like got Imo 10/10",10
The Witcher,It's better than I thought! I am loving it!I am enjoying every minute with Geralt,10
The Witcher,"Liked it so far, Creatues-Design is good and it feels a bit like a mix of Game Of Thrones and The Last Kingdom (:I Liked The First Season, The Action was huge and greatGood Characters, but it felt like The Witcher himself hasnt had to do as much as other Characters in the Big Scequence .....9 / 10",9
The Witcher,Just wanted to give it a 10 before i start watching because i am that confident that it will be just amazing. Definitely a binge-worthy series for this weekend. Henry Cavill is really invested in the world and the story as a fan and as an actor so i believe he will do Geralt justice and really bring him to life.,10
The Witcher,"What a quality production for a TV series. This is the real fantasy world everyone has been waiting for.
This will remove any previous fantasy world show you had watched before.",10
The Witcher,"Cheap clichés, lousy special effects, and cheesy ""gruff"" accents. A discount Game of Thrones for the simple folk.",1
The Witcher,"I was terrified when news was first released about this TV show adaptation of The Witcher book series. I didn't want some random TV writers ruining a great part of my childhood (the books) while simultaneously ruining a great part of my young adulthood (the game series). I thought it would be impossible for a TV series about Geralt n' crew to be anywhere near this good. God answered my prayers people. Damn good people built and molded this series into (dare I say it) Game of Thrones S1-7 quality!!! To be completely honest episode one was an average opening. Its how the show progressed through the 7 remaining episodes that made it so spectacular. All the great parts of the first and second books are used and God did I have a mile wide grin on my face watching some of these scenes come to life. The last time I felt this good about a TV series was back in 2013 when Game of Thrones season 3 ended. Its quite the feeling. If you've read the books or played the games have no fear, the people that made this adaption keep you very comfortable while watching. I can't wait for season 2! By the way, if you don't like the fantasy genre, this is still an amazing watch in its own merit. Acting, writing, directing, cinematography, the lot of it. This show will please any viewer, guarenteed.",10
The Witcher,The best tv serious for ever now i can see tv after game of thrones please Netflix we wait for season 2,10
The Witcher,"I love the game with all my heart. I was waiting desperately for this series. But, also keeping my expectations low so not to be disappointed later. But gladly, this isn't happening here. I was following the news all along and was touched when heard Cavill was putting every bit of his energy into it and boy it paid off ,I can see it now. Hats off to him. If you've read the books or played the game or both than it's a gem for you. Enjoy the holidays :)",9
The Witcher,"If you really enjoyed the game and the books you'll definitely love this series, trust me you won't regret it",1
The Witcher,"I don't ever make reviews. I always just go on IMDB to see what show to watch. I've a huge of the Witcher games so I obviously have been waiting a while for this show to come out. I am in tears from how amazing this show is. Henry Cavil has Geralt down to the T, the music and set pieces are amazing. Might be the best show ever to come out on Netflix. Watch it!!!",10
The Witcher,"Wow, what a great job by Netflix. The pacing is perfect and pulls you into the world perfectly. The combat is superb and the acting is awesome. So happy we got this.",10
The Witcher,"WOW WOW WOW justo wow. The cinematography is simply amazing, amazing costumes and the story catches you. A Netflix masterpiece. Do yourself a favor and watch it",10
The Witcher,I'm going back now I think this is gonna be amazing,10
The Witcher,"Why so much hatred from professional critics? This series impresses from the very first minute. Atmosphere, dialogues, fight scenes. I feel like I'm reading a Witcher book. I am tired of these comparisons with Game of Thrones. This is not a Game of Thrones! This is Witcher! And it's good!",10
The Witcher,"First episode in and I can say without a doubt that it's by far the most anbitious bit of fantasy put to the small screen ever. Interwoven snippets of the first two books are told here, which suggests a larger scale story throughout the series. Cinematography, the sets, costumes and cast all do well to bring the the last wish to life, but it's the last act of the episode that really hits home just how much the guys have really nailed it.
Cavill, after a few jarring moments of dialogue, (I think I was probably still trying to get used to his ""Geralt"" voice) settles into the role and truly does become the witcher. His mannerisms, his graceful movements during swordplay, (pirouetting, just as he does in the books) his wording and even the sub-text, the words not spoken, he captures it all perfectly.
And yes, the fight scenes really do make game of thrones look like an afternoon at downtown Abbey.
I won't go on any longer, mostly because I'm dying to watch the next episode, but to anyone still in doubt of the casting. Watch it and fall in love, or don't, it's your loss!",10
The Witcher,"First few episodes may be a bit rough around the edges, it has some pacing issues in my opinion, everything else is really really good. Acting,Atmosphere and the overall feel to it drags you into it.
Keep in mind, this IS NOT GOT!!! Its The Witcher. I read the Books and played the Games. Its very adult and im glad Netflix did not shy away give you a real Witcher Experience. Lets only hope it will carry on like that. 9.5/10",10
The Witcher,"I've been waiting so long for this and it is everything I wanted it to be. Funny, scary, dark and amazing.",10
The Witcher,Amazing fight scenes and a great visualization of the story we know from the books. Can't wait for season 2!,10
The Witcher,"Netflix does is again , i was worried that they could ruined it but i was completely wrong, it is the best netflix show I've ever seen, the cast , the soundtracks, you feel like you've felt when you're playing the game , henry nailed geralt of rivia , thanks Netflix and all the cast members, I'm loving it",10
The Witcher,"So I've read through some of these reviews and the clowns leaving 1 star saying it's a game of thrones knockoff haven't seen the episodes. I won't mention any spoilers, but holy smokes that fight scene in episode 1. The plot overall is mind blowing!",10
The Witcher,"Best show i've seen all year, great characters, great casting (Henry Cavill is a perfect choice for Geralt) storyline is true to The Witcher ""universe"" and it's interesting.",10
The Witcher,I really like how the show started . I really like it . Just really interesting .,10
The Witcher,"Its very good I hope it's always the best,
Many are waiting for this movie to come
Thanks",10
The Witcher,"The pacing is a bit off, but overall it's quite decent so far. The only thing that ruins the atmosphere is the unnecessary random inclusion of black characters. Trust me, I'm not racist, but when the books take place in the world inspired by medieval Eastern Europe, it feels just out of place to see black people not in a role of traders or mercenaries in appropriate outfits. The casting of Triss and Fringilla is also a disaster, it just doesn't feel familiar, feels completely off.",6
The Witcher,"First episode has its pros and cons , I don't want to criticize too much , but character selection is absolutely done by a moron. Also netflix is again putting their ""people of color"" agenda into a medieval fantasy show ( which is heavily depending on Polish folklore, did you hear any indian or black person in polish folklore....) , why? Why would you try to ruing such a great book. Anyway I hope Netflix will not try shoving their lgbt agenda and color agenda into our throats in rest of the series.",3
The Witcher,"I knew this was going to be good. I mean the trailer looked amazing and it's Henry Cavill. But I never imagined it to be this good. If you like Game of Thrones you will love this. It's everything the same plus more. It is just as violent with just as much nudity and profanity. But the story and music and cinematography are incredible and the actress who plays Ciri really steals the show. She is incredible.
Netflix has another huge hit here, give it a go! This does not dissapoint.*Note I have only played the games and not read the books*",8
The Witcher,A great first impression of Cirilla's character played by Freya Allan. This is going to be a bit special in the following seasons to come.,10
The Witcher,"Reviewing this after only two episodes, but I am sure I'll keep watching. The script is a bit corny and dialogues rather shallow, but the story itself and the choreography is really good.I'm glad they got Alik Sakharov on this.",4
The Witcher,The same trash that rates this garbage spin off a 10 is the same that rates star wars a 1... It's really easy to see how little people need to be entertained ??. You're a goof if you think this is good at all. Main actor is weak af and no story. It's a bad video game not worth its rating either. No wonder the show is garbage too. Shoulda stuck being Superman buddy.,1
The Witcher,"The movie lacks spirit and good performances. Henry Cavil is probably among the only good actors in this series. The portrayal of Geralt is authentic enough for me, but that's not really enough to save the show. It's poorly written and directed. I found myself cringing at too many scenes to count.",5
The Witcher,Fking Awsome it's brilliantly done just like the game and books,10
The Witcher,"The Witcher show is absolutely magical. Great, great, great. I love the story, cast, combat, atmosphere, music, magic, monsters, costumes, surroundings. Everything.I am a huge fan of the Witcher since 2001. Since then I read all the books 6 times. I played all the Witcher games since 2007 and The Witcher 3 is still my all-time favourite game (400 hours of play). I also read the Witcher graphic novels (4 novels).Henry is fantastic. I also love the story of Yennefer and Ciri. I like that we see their story right in the 1st season. Jaskier is great also.This is a fine show! There is a room to improve, but I just enjoyed it how it is.",10
The Witcher,"I gotta ask, have the producer got a clue at all about the witcher lore?. The show is very badly written, very bad acting, it kinda feels like a budget show. I gotta bring it up, this feels more like a political correct wokeness witcher",1
The Witcher,"Damn first few episodes of Witcher is just dope, I never ever thought in my wildest dream that a show can even come close to GOT but I was awestruck when I watched starting few episodes of this series let's hope all the episodes of this first season are dope as well.",10
The Witcher,"Faithful to the books and video game series?, this is just as good if not better than Game of Thrones and is a must watch for both fans of all fantasy plus those that don't love fantasy. Loved it even more than Mandalorian and is probably my favorite series. Story telling, acting and visuals were great. Netflix really set the bar with this one.",10
The Witcher,"Very good, be sure to see if you regret it.
Very good, be sure to see if you regret it.",10
The Witcher,When I heard that they pinching Witcher's for tele release with henry cavil I was skeptical.basically whoever played the Witcher's know all the characters(leads).i would say after watching this series I'm not at all disappointed.they did amazing job of all important characters representation weather it's a male or female character on the top Henry cavil understand the methodology of the Witcher's the way which he acted in this series he didn't need more dialog we can just see that this is Gerald.overall I'm happy that we got to see the series it's definitely needed seasons since in the last episode it ended in high notes.looking forward to see more sword fighting,10
The Witcher,"Henry cavill nailed the role perfectly. The fight scenes, the music, the cinematography, the whole atmosphere is beyond amazing. Netflix did it again",9
The Witcher,"I don't know how it can have 9,9 of 10 on first minute after release? Where raters buyed by producers?But, I don't get it, could showrunner not look in wikipedia or wikia for char description? Dark skinned Yennifer, black skinned Fringilla (they have to look similar! who read the book will understand) and awesome looking Geralt! Bodybuilders rules the shows. The readers of the Witcher are disappointed.Costumes are really ugly and seems very cheap. Sometimes the animation (beasts) looks that way too. Some fight scene looked for me like it was a Chinese battle movie.I watched the complete series with my wife and because of that I read the books I could say who is who and which situation is playing now. Show runner could make an accent on time the situation is playing because the show has redone the timeline of the books. I guess them wanted to make it straight on, so they deleted some important facts from original.A really important part is missing - temple and Neneke or Dandelion's beret.Show runner got rid of slovenian culture, forgotten in which years Gerlat lived (black polish people - really?) and made the show American and ***** on other nations.I am disappointed!",1
The Witcher,"As usual reviews are ones opinion. So I want mine in before the usual hate, that seems so characteristic as of late.
The environment and the story are faithful enough to the book series and some aspects of the game, and this probably will please almost all fans.
If you never met the series, either the books or the games and you like magic/fiction GoT style you won't be disappointed with this series.
Have fun.",10
The Witcher,"I just watched the first and it is awesome!
Henry Cavil is born to be Geralt of Rivia",10
The Witcher,"I am a huge Witcher fan since the first game came out, read the books recently and had extreemly high expectations of this series, usually with such high expectations i get dissapointed, but not in this case, it was everything I hoped for and more. The story is so emotional and deep. The acting is great and the fanatsy is not lacking.An easy 10/10",10
The Witcher,I will start saying I played all Witcher Games and loved them . But Wow this It's FK Awesome it's just perfect ! Actor's played super well and the effects are really super . Must see for every Witcher and no fan . For me perfect !,10
The Witcher,"I was very sceptical regarding this show. At first Henry Cavil didn't seem to be the right actor to play Geralt when he was announced in my opinion. I did like his looks from the PC Game series a lot.But...They made this World very atmospheric added some fun parts here and there and the best thing is, Geralt is played so great I can't believe it. Epic Fighting scenes, some decent battles as well as well adapted screenplay makes this show a huge candidate for the next big show like GOT.I'm now 3 episodes in the first season and if they keep this quality going for the other 5 episodes, this is the best series released this year in my opinion.I hope for many more seasons!",10
The Witcher,"In just an episoade i lived all the emotions, really skilled actors. The fight scenes, realistic, brutal and well made. I'm very pleased with the result, its a real pleasure to watch it. Netflix, 10.
Henry Cavil, 10. Keep it up.",10
The Witcher,Absolutely stunning television. Henry Cavill is a credit to the character of Geralt of Rivia. Please give us all the way up to the end of game 3. Easily the best TV since (early) GoT.,10
The Witcher,"I love the witcher both the books and the games, the TV show follows the books and the story starts in Blavikan...But man not 15 minutes in the first episode and they already started to blast your usual Netflix political propaganda, weak man, strong women, man being belittled by women, no man fighting back, wow got to say you could not be more wrong, there are strong female in the witcher but in all honesty this is just a travesty... would be ok if they were organic but no, the are forced and acted poorly that just breaks the immersion which is sad, I really love the Witcher.",1
The Witcher,"I will be brief-
The acting overall is good, henry does the job well, Ciri and yenffer are portrayed better then i expected and i really liked dandelion actor.
There are other actors which i felt didn't do a good job but that mostly because the dialogue can be stiff at times.
The fights are very good (especially when geralt is fighting) but some shots needed to be longer in the fighting scenes.
The shows stays faithfull to the books but changes a few bits of details (mostly nothing to be mad over).
Overall? Its a good show and as a witcher fan (both books and games) its better then what i expected. Its not the masterpiece everyone is calling it though.",7
The Witcher,"Guys its really good!! I like it
Everyone must watch. You will be delighted",10
The Witcher,"Absolutely love everything...been a fan of game, and this series looking even better than the game.",10
The Witcher,"Wonderful storytelling, good acting, especially Henry. Felt so immersed in the world. Love the music in the show as well :)",10
The Witcher,I really love it . Zzz.,10
The Witcher,It's not even 5 minutes into episode 1 and it's already woke. Then it precedes to get woker with each passing minute. The story seems like it would be great for 12 year olds but I could not get into it. All very trite and lacking gravitas.,1
The Witcher,"Off to an amazing start.Well acted, well cast.Incredibly beautiful to look at in hdr.Could be a massive hit and hopefully be around for many years.",9
The Witcher,"I am sorry but if the first episode didn't do anything for me how can i watch the entire season. That;s why we have pilot episodes...you do it to see if its could, correct the mistakes and thena approove the whole production.. It lacks good direction, the shots , the dialogue, the perfomances , the structure its by the numbers. its similar to the '' The Last Kingdom'' with bigger budget and with the same wicknesses if not even more... The biggest asset of the series , is at the same time the biggest weakness. Herny Cavill am sorry but with no good director its clearly you are a mediocur actor... you re perfomance its too wooden , lowering your voice doesn't make you badass or whatever your told .. to much exposision done the wrong way.. many fans prior to the relaese of the series compared it to Game of Thrones.. Got had from the first episode good writing and character , world building just by showing a freaking map of Westeros. This show shows magic like its nothing special. .Get a good writer and a good director. the series is so bland and mainstream.",3
The Witcher,"Cinematography is something else. Good acting, great Henry but it does not faze me in terms of the final edit. The monsters are cheap too. But, the show is entertaining nevertheless.",3
The Witcher,"Geralt fighting scene was beyond incredible, never seen anything close to that in cinematography. The soundtrack and atmosphere is so immersive too, gives the exact Witcher vibe I expected!Actors are right on par with Witcher 3. So far it gives justice to the series as a whole. I love the games and the books, now Netflix series is right there on the shelf of my favorite things in the world! I'm so grateful to all the people who made this possible, you guys are amazing, thank you so much! I can really feel with how much love and care this was created. Thanks!",10
The Witcher,Great show this. Also very happy that a 2nd season is already confirmed.,10
The Witcher,"Lots of 10/10 in one hour period. Did you even watch the whole season? Whatever, this is like a tv show that you want to watch only while you eat something and there is nothing left to watch. Actings are bad Henry Cavil is ok but others like 5th grade actors. Lots of Disney like scenes and talkings like watching a theather. Cringe CGIs, lots of bad lighting. Mucis and sound fx are like student movie. Also directing is very bad. There are 4 directors of the show all of them failed i guess.
P.s never read the books and never played games. Not a fanboy. Loves fantasy and sci-fi",5
The Witcher,"This show is awesome, each episode is like a movie on its own. Game Of the thrones who needs that show with the worst ending, when you have SUPERMAN as THE WITCHER. I have been a fan of the game, but trust me when I say this, its a humongous project for Netflix. I hope for an even better second season.
This is addictive.",10
The Witcher,People who are saying that it would be as good as game of thrones are fool. It's not. It's get cringy some time. Also henry cavill bad acting is another thing.,1
The Witcher,"If you know the story, understand all characters then you will understand me. Definitely the worst interpretation of the story. It's not a slavic series. Just another movie about middle ages. Showrunners did great movie for community and not for a fans of Witcher universe . Congrats! Wrong actors, wrong atmosphere. You did great job for ruining all the expectations.",1
The Witcher,"The series is simply mesmerizing with its atmosphere and Istria. The ideal line between the harsh, cruel Middle Ages and the magical world that looks in some scenes is even more severe. This series is for adults who will be able to appreciate the beauty and tragedy of the world of the Witcher universe. 10/10 !!! Deserved!",10
The Witcher,H. Cavill nailed the character. One of the best series to date!,10
The Witcher,"...or actually Ending, at least for me. I am one of these guys, who was reading first stories of the Witcher in famous science fiction polish magazine ""Nowa Fantastyka"" ages ago. I remember tense discussions regarding english translation: should it be ""Witcher"" or ""Hexer""? I did not play games, just a little bit of the very first one. I liked it, but the fencing and high stance (or guard) was not my taste.Anyway, after watching the first episode, I am disappointed so bad, that I not planing to watch the rest of this series for now. There is nothing left of Andrzej Sapkowski's magic or humor. I do not understand, why every screenwriter tries to correct author's stories. They are perfect! And they are written like they are made for movie or series adaptation! The same happened to terrible polish version. And it seems that Netflix is following that disastrous path as well.Where is Lion of Cintra, mighty Calanthe?
Renfri prophesying about Ciri?Sorry guys, but that's too much for me...",1
The Witcher,"Ill start this by saying I was apprehensive about this as a fan of the witcher already I felt it was going to be so easy for them to ruin something brilliant but I was wrong oh so wrong, the entire show has been brought to the screen beautifully. Henry Cavill plays Geralt amazingly you can tell he put the extra effort into this. Watching this really makes you wanting more it's been a while since I was this emersed in a tv show and can't wait to see where they take it next!",9
The Witcher,"AMAZING,ENTERTAINING,THRILLING,AND UNEXPECTED Best way to end the decade!!!!",10
The Witcher,"Looked so forward but it s not what I have expected.
story is very weak not excited at all
dialoques are for kids
but just looked 3 episodes, maybe it will be better",5
The Witcher,"Damn it i had to rewind the fight scenes, most brutal sword fights i've ever seen...
if you read the books or played the video games, you are going to enjoy this.",10
The Witcher,After 6 episodes I can already say that this is a very good series. Little too much nudity for me but overall I like it. It's definitely not a show to watch with family.,10
The Witcher,"I've read the books and played the games so I guess I'm a little biased, but I LOVE this show, production quality is through the roof!",10
The Witcher,"...says one fantastic reviewer here.Why give it a one because of the subpar acting, why give it a one for the horrendous direction, why give it a one for miscasting most of the actors, why give it a one for shamelessly throwing in our throats a mess of politically correctness which completely annihilates the lore of the books, why give it a one for the cheap locations, why give it a one for not even intending to put together various standalone short stories, why give it a one for making this mess feeling like playing double-downed Witcher 3 short stories, why give it a one for the cheesy script, why give it a one for the cheap monsters, why give it a one for gross technical inaccuracies in fighting, why give it a one for the poor cinematography, why give it a one for the mediocre lines-dialogues, why give it a one for the pretentious (sometimes out of place) music, why give it a one for the average montage (editing), why give it a one for the explosive yet subpar effects, why give it a one for the terrible character development, why give it a one for the cheap nudity just thrown there with absolutely no other reason but to 'entertain' a dubious class of viewers - when you can just give it a ten to fight the 'haters' (a very strange internet notion that has nothing to do with our good ol' 'real' hate, used by teenagers without really understanding its meaning)?Why indeed.",1
The Witcher,"I was extremely excited to hear that Netflix was making a show about the Witcher. I liked The Witcher 3 and loved seeing the lore and characters implemented into Gwent. I had my Hope's and doubts and was overall excited to see how the show progressed. But WOW...Just WOW. This show is something incredible. Within seconds I felt as though I was emerged into the world of the Witcher, with many characters that were casted and scripted just right! Cannot wait to see what they have in store for this show!",9
The Witcher,"So I watched the first 3 episodes and I enjoyed it.
I don't understand the 1 of 10 ratings though?
Its a very good show, it entertains and the fight scenes are really good!",9
The Witcher,"A 10/10 show if you are a witcher fan, simply amazing all i can say",10
The Witcher,"Production has an incredibly important place to shoot a series or film. Sometimes even a very minimalist story can reach an incredibly successful point after the right production stages. The Witcher series is far from minimalist. The Witcher is one of the best Middle-earth works in the world. Production quality is essential if you want to handle such a topic successfully.The world that The Witcher goes through is a world with its own rules, races, characters, creatures, beliefs, even if it does not seem too strange to those familiar with fantastic narratives. In particular, the first two chapters carry the risk of being too confusing while reflecting the details of this world to the audience. After the chapters where it is difficult to fully understand which character serves whom and why, the story becomes more beautiful as the other characters gradually increase in the narrative. There are two main characters in the narrative except Geralt. One of them is Ciri, who was advised to find Geralt when her lands were taken over by the enemies. The other is Yennefer, a kind of witch whose aim is to gain as much power as possible. While the goal of these two characters is evident, the fact that Geralt at the center of the narrative does not have a significant motivation due to the character's characteristics causes the story to be thrown from one place to another. However, the story deepens as the characteristics of this character become evident and the dynamics of the world in which events take place gradually emerge. It is the primary factor that gives the dark tone of The Witcher's world that people use their power and material resources to seize land. The dark narrative that expresses the evil within man is supported by the visual language of the series. The visual language, dominated by darkness and shadows, brings The Witcher closer to a gothic horror narrative from time to time when combined with the characteristics of the characters it contains. This dark atmosphere also gains a realistic tone with the violence of the series. The Witcher, one of Netflix's most courageous works to date, relentlessly conveys the mess of the world it tells. It creates a consistent and dark atmosphere thanks to well-captured battle and combat scenes and technical details such as image management and music usage. 9/10",9
The Witcher,"Maybe if u read the books you will learn something about the series. Most of the material in the books is in the series, also every director will give its own flare and OF COURSE something will be change but it won't affect the series. And for last if you could maybe read the directors description of the material she is working you will comprehend everything. I have to say good job to Henry and the cast, because they did great job, i wasn't fond of the casting, but i'm glad it changed my mind. If you are not fans of the books and the game don't judge the show because you don't know how it should play out.",10
The Witcher,"I would say you don't want to to miss out on this masterpiece, but don't worry you won't. This is going to be as big as GoT. Flawless show top to bottom. Best of 2019.",10
The Witcher,"Pretty amazing storytelling, fantastic score like the video game, and amazing cinematography. Witcher is the best TV show of this year. 9/10",9
The Witcher,"A watered-down version of the books, gaps in each episode that feels rushed.
Don't get me wrong, the acting is excellent and Henry portraying of Geralt of Rivia come from someone who knows the character, but the plot should be improved in season two (that would be the Blood of Elves).",6
The Witcher,Easily one of the most amazing shows of 2019. the acting and fight scenes are great. Great work Netflix!,10
The Witcher,"Awesome show, awesome world, awesome plot based on the books!",10
The Witcher,"Hello my review will be short. I really enjoyed the tv show yet i really disliked Henry Cavill, Freya Allan and Anya Charlota as Yennefer in their roles. Playing all three games, watching poor version of Witcher from my country Poland and reading books I must truly say I dont know how they received their roles. I dont mind their acting Henry Cavill was great in Superman and Mission Impossible but he isn't the Geralt I wanted to see. If u dont agree with me plz find picture of Grazyna Wolszczak Playing as Yennefer in 2001 then maybe you will know what Im talking about . Anya Charlota is very beautiful girl but thinking about the Yennefer I would like to see woman like Grazyna Wolszczak playing that role. Moreover seeing small black boy in forest or afro-american Knight from Cintra is crazly ridiculous. The rest i really enjoyed",8
The Witcher,This show is unbelievable and the atmosphere of the series is stunningly beautiful. Henry Cavill is by far the best choice to play Geralt. I can't wait for a season 2. Way to go Netflix,10
The Witcher,Having played the games and read the books I had a lot of worries about how well an adaption by Netflix would be. The trailers got me slowly more and more excited towards the premiere. But seeing the first 2 episodes now this show blows my mind. I simply love it. More than I have loved any show before. And I'm coming into this also as having read all of R.R Martins GOT books and loved the show. Even my girlfriend that does not like GOT and not that much and not into fantasy loved this show.,9
The Witcher,"""The Witcher"" is one of the greatest sagas in the full Mankind history. It also corresponds for both, literature and games. But this ""tv show"" is the worst that can happened with this sagas. Total miscasting (except, unexpected H.C.), totall misunderstanding the world of Witcher (God, Lillit and etc). The worst armours for both armies (just looool for Nilfs). Everything in this TV show is just crap: the script, the music, the atmosphere.",1
The Witcher,"I've loved the book series ever since I was little, and been waiting long before this show was announced for a television series.It might be modern, a bit ""americanised"" some might say. But it's an amazing portrayal of the characters, Henry Cavill in my mind is the perfect Geralt of Rivia. The missing of slavic sense, might be an issue for people in the slavic regions. But overall, they did it perfect as they did.To start bickering about the small details is just stupid, they have followed the material perfect!Enjoy the series as I have, it's amazing@",10
The Witcher,Here in tv show is just a Woker. Omg this tv show is bad. Armors are like cheep plastic story is lame all this 10 reviews are paid by Writer Lauren who shouod nevef touch Witcher i m saying this as Polish.,8
The Witcher,"It looks cheap and is extremely slow. I had a hard time getting into it. The gore, the mediocre acting, the rather dull and uninteresting characters, the dark atmosphere, the music, the lights ... sigh. This doesn't look like a high budget show at all. So if you're a hardcore dark fantasy fan and don't mind low budget shows, The Witcher will entertain you. But after seeing the trailer and knowing it was advertised as the next big hit after ""Game Of Thrones"" I expected something that looked much, much better with a more intriguing story, better dialogues, better characters, better ... everything. I mean, it could be worse, I guess, but well... I even marked the air date in my calendar because I was so excited and now I don't even know if I want to finish this. A typical case of ""false advertising"".",5
The Witcher,"Books, games, mixture of both. You cannot be disappointed by this. Brilliant pacing. Suberp acting and action. For fans new and old this is a late contender for best series of 2019. In 5 years who knows the heights this could reach. MUST WATCH",10
The Witcher,Iam big fan for The witcher game. So I think the show will be legendary because Netflix very good with fantasy story.,10
The Witcher,Amazing series amazing action characters . Something like game of thrones,10
The Witcher,"Into the third episode, really good so far. I t seems in line with the books as far as tone and visuals. Great effects and action scenes. Looks like a hit.",10
The Witcher,"The Witcher - early reviewMinor spoilersI am 3 episodes in and must say that I'm disappointed so far. I played Witcher 3, but never read the books. Still, I was excited for the series. I didn't mind the changes, cast-wise, etc. It is an adaptation and should be different. When film or television adapts a literary work (or comic book or video game), sticking too close to the source material is boring. I don't need/want it to be identical. But the changes should make sense for the new medium, should bring greater elements that are unique to the new medium.Unfortunately, I have to agree with other reviewers that commented that too many elements seem B-grade. This is not ""prestige"" television.It is perhaps that I am somewhat tainted by other things I've been viewing recently. I just finished watching The Expanse and Watchmen. I'm a couple episodes into His Dark Materials and have finally gotten around to watching Black Sails, of which I'm two seasons into.The Good
I like Henry Cavill. Others have stated that they find his portrayal ""wooden"". Considering that the character is intended to be a classic stoic and his being a witcher is supposed to eradicate all feelings, I feel his acting is appropriate. It also should provide greater drama if/when he starts displaying unexpected emotions when he finally connects with Yennefer and Ciri.I like Freya Allan as Ciri. She comes across as innocent and playful and curious in the beginning, then becomes scared, shocked, terrified by the things that happen around her as her story develops.I'm going to withhold my opinion of Anya Chalotra as Yennefer for her portrayal based upon my comments below.The other actors/characters feel like stock television, neither elevating the material they are given to work with, nor destroying the atmosphere of the show with poor ability.The cinematography is excellent. The music fits nicely, but I certainly hope that Dandelion's bard songs improve in a hurry, because, oh boy, are they bad.
Speaking of bad...The Bad
The dialogue. Ugh. It is booorring. No one says anything that is lyrical, carries portents, mysteriously foreshadows, or is funny. The actors try to deliver their lines to make them sound important, etc., but the words do them no favors. It is all so matter-of-fact or exposition.The plotting. Strike Two. Since too many people want to compare this to GoT, I'll say The Witcher certainly shares one element with GoT, specifically, the final season of GoT. Things happen, one scene to the next, one episode to the next, that don't make any sense. Sudden time jumps undercut the actors portrayals and disrupt the natural flow of the plot. Characters emotions turn on a dime and come across as dishonest and unearned. The beats don't hit their notes right. It's like listening to someone play music you want to like, but the instrument is out of tune.This is especially, cringefully, true in the case of Yennefer. I feel sorry for Anya Chalotra as she is betrayed by the scripts. She starts out very well as the deformed  daughter of a pig farmer. She's bullied and cowed. It is apparent this has all she has known all her life. She feels no hope. All done very well by the naturally beautiful actor. Out of fear, panic, whatever, she unconsciously displays a magical ability. She's quickly scooped up by the Sorcerer's guild (you're a wizard, 'Arry).
She struggles mightily, cannot learn the spells, cannot control her emotions (which help control the spells), cannot seem to do the basic things tasked of her. Her classmates are given no personalities AT ALL. Here's the chubby one, here's the one who can't let go of her dolly, here's the black one. We're supposed to care which of these will succeed at sorcery and be elevated, but I struggled to keep straight which names were showing aptitude and which were on their way out the door. This is especially true when three are selected to, uh, not make it to the next level. Why these three? Why were they not good enough? What did they do wrong? Who knows? The show certainly didn't care, so why should we, which sucks ALL the life from what should have been a pivotal scene.
Lastly, Yennefer goes through a sudden, jarring personality change all within ONE episode. (sound familiar, Daenarys fans?) She's the poor, deformed, downtrodden thing in one scene, then suddenly she's strong, confident, has a sense of agency in the very next. And this is before she goes through her physical metamorphosis. (oh, it's because she got laid? Puh-lease) Also, there is no explanation, display of talent, or otherwise, that would indicate she should be elevated in ""witch school"". But is anyways.I, of course, will watch the remainder of Season 1 and may append this review in the future. It took me 4 episodes to really get hooked by Black Sails, so maybe this is similar.Otherwise, I cannot recommend this to anyone who is not already a fan of the books or games. This is not appointment television. It is not laughably terrible, but merely a serviceable entertainment.",5
The Witcher,"""Where are we?"" ""At the spa (sarcastically). Where do you think?"" - Actual quote from the show.The rating keeps going lower with each episode. Horrible dialogue. They better find better writers for this show. For something supposed to be epic, it looks and sounds like show for teens.",5
The Witcher,"10/10
Fights 10/10
Characters 10/10
Henry Cavill 10/10The best performance what Henry Cavill ever did
You know...
I was afraid I'd see Superman in Geralt.
Now I will see Geralt in Superman.After really long time this is another TV show what really caught me and.... In my opinion...
This is The Best TV show of this decade
Can't wait for second seasson.",10
The Witcher,"Long story short, it's my new obsession! Such a good production, script, acting etc EVERYTHING is just so amazing!!!",10
The Witcher,"Having read some critics reviews I was not expecting much. I could not have been more surprised to find it a casting masterclass, a visually compelling and superbly acted wonder. The look is right, the feel is right and old Henry is just quality through and through. The whole production is just mind-blowing and so refreshing considering the recent big budget blockbuster let downs this year. Netflix is just a great platform, the content produced is so frequent and enjoyable. Brilliant.",10
The Witcher,"As someone who's read all the books and played all the games this is a far cry from what I was hoping for. Got a bad vibe already from the trailers and sadly the released show isn't any better. Strange camera angles and cutting, painfully overacted and overemotional. Some surroundings and pieces obviously stolen from GoT. Overall messy plot and introduction of locations and characters.The way to introduce this series would have been to have Geralt riding alone in a bleak wilderness and forest, camping, hunting, cooking, accepting a contract from some small village, tracking, preparing potions and at the end of a the first episode take down some kind of great beast. The end. Very few words spoken. That would have been a great introduction to the world. A slow and suspenseful introduction similar to what we got in GoT episode 1 and a feeling somewhat similar to The Revenant.The world of the Witcher isn't suppose to be overfilled with emotion or politics, it's supposed to be bleak, cynical, harsh, brutal and stoic. But then with occasional glimpses of hope, beauty and right vs wrong. There is politics and kings in the witcher universe but the focus is supposed to be on the struggle of the everyday man and everyday life. The feeling of the Witcher Universe is supposed to be much more ""The Hound and Arya on the road"" rather than ""Cersei at court"" if you catch my drift.But instead we jump straight into lots of politics and some characters are introduced way to fast, no one cares about things when they're introduced this quickly. Maybe towards the middle, or the end of, the first season would have been the time to introduce politics and royalty.The way I see it there's basically no way to salvage this train wreck, completely new writing, actors and director would be needed. Cavill is decent, but then I was never his biggest fan. He's nearly always ""decent"", never stellar imho.
even if we imagine that this isn't in the Witcher universe this is objectively speaking at best a 7/10 show.",5
The Witcher,"Holy smokes the athmosphere is there!! They could do it. The drama, the score, actors, fight scenes and most of all Henry Cavill is brilliant. Also Anya and Freya are shining too!! I can not thank enough the whole crew, Andrzej and Lauren Hissrich, that at the end of the year they made a show that easing the deep space and pain that GOT has left with its last season. The end of Four Marks made me trully emotional. Thank you again.",10
The Witcher,"... this will put things into perspective .I didn't like the final season of GOT, at all .Now imagine a rip-off with terrible actors , an even worse script, lazy camera work and generic netflix editing .That's what we have here .",2
The Witcher,"The film technical side of this show is absolutely terrible. Some of the shots look incredible bad and tacky. The colours in every shot looks either like a cheap rip off horror film or is so over saturated that it feels like a add. The main character Geralets eyes look terrible because it's cheap CGI. It doesn't really look like Geralt either because of the lack of his scar. The world feels fake and flat because there obviously hasn't been put work into make it feel like the middle ages. And in my opinion world building is one of the most important part of fantasy. I only just started the show and it already shows that they haven't looked deep into the lore, I immediately noticed the lack of Geralts second sword. They fail to show how hated Witchers are and make the characters who don't like him for being a Witcher seem like dicks. Even though there's a lot of history behind it",3
The Witcher,Amazing what can i say more this is very good series for the got,10
The Witcher,"Just finish episode 1 and loved it. I didn't thought It would be this good but it raises my bar. Great action, Soundtrack is way good. Its going to be top series of this year..",10
The Witcher,"The good news: Despite some strange contours, overall it's a good production. The series gets better over time and is not boring. Henry Cavill is a decent Geralt. But personally, I think Anya Chalotra makes a great Yennefer.
If you like medieval fantasies, action, drama, some comedy.
It's really worth seeing this series. I give 7.5 out of 10.",7
The Witcher,"Absolutely love it, as a megafan of the books and games twas a bit worried, especially not ever even hearing of most of the cast... Not anymore, everything is perfect",10
The Witcher,Great cast choice. Fits perfectly. Voice and impression made me impressed. Love it!!,10
The Witcher,For starters. This series is based on the books for those who don't know. From what i have watched its based off The first book The Last Wish and i'm sure the Sword of DestinyThis is one of the best shows I have seen on Netflix. Henry Cavil is amazing as well is the rest of the acting. Production value is very very good. The locations bring the series to life.I'm not going to say much beyond watch this. If you are a fan of the series Watch this. If you are looking for lore beyond 3 games Watch this.,10
The Witcher,"Is that everyone moves so slowly. I just want it to move on, but it's like all the characters are moving through molasses. Otherwise, awesome.",8
The Witcher,"To the ""entertainment weekly"" critic who admittedly only watched 1 episode and hated ""The Witcher"":
??You need another occupation.
They and a few other HBO fellatiates have been wanting to hate it before it ever came out; and, at the very least wanted a non-thinking, jj Abrams instant action video game meets GOT.
They can all *suck it*
.
The Netflix series? Has a few flaws but overall?
Its amazing.
Clavell is a perfect Geralt of Rivia, by the end.of the series there's no doubt why he wanted the role, and how hard he worked to bring Geralt to life.
Witcher showrunners choice to use animatronics and puppets instead of CGI for most of the creatures is a mixed bag, on the one hand the actors are interacting with ""real"" creatures, and the creatures have a weight and substance; on the other hand, we've become so used to CGI that the creatures while a nostalgic look for some, lack the flawless movement we've become used too (aka demigorgon) I personally prefer the animatronics, but think a better blending of the two, would create a better effect.
The initial confusion of the first few episodes is intentional, as it is with Andrej's short stories.If you are not familiar with the books, I promise that by episode 3 it will begin to make sense. Time in Andrej's stories is almost a character itself, and ebbs and flows wildly. Netflix did a fantastic job setting up how time is twisted up without spelling it out for you or spoon feeding it. It requires you to think; and to pay attention, so you know what time is then, and what time is future, and what time is now, what is imagined and what is real. It's the single most important theme in the witcher books and the showrunners have captured it beautifully, because when you hit that epiphany that ""A-Ha! I get it!"" moment you'll be hooked, just like I was with the books.",10
The Witcher,I just watched 2 episodes and i think it's the series of the year,10
The Witcher,"Yea, I'm just not feeling it. Fight scenes are pretty cool, opening scene was cool and has the savage factor. But that's about it. I've not cared about any character in the first episode. I have no cooking clue where this is going besides the obvious part of ( save the cheerleader, save the world). I'm not comparing this to any other fantasy, but a little more direction from the story would be GREAT.",6
The Witcher,The show after watching an episode or two is fine. Overhyped a ton. Looks small budget at times. Looks high budget at times. Cavill is really good. Some stuff is boring. Plot is okay but boring. This isn't anything special. Its not the new GOT. Just another decent netflix show.,7
The Witcher,"One of the best series that i watched. If you don't understand the movie, play the game and read the book.",10
The Witcher,"They are page for page th first book. Legit appreciate the plot points, the dialog can be bad and Henry cavil can throw the accent but god damnn.. tip my hat off netflix tbis is true to the fans.",10
The Witcher,"My fears came true, Awful. Terrible CGI and awful acting and thats just in the first scene. Next.",1
The Witcher,"Do not expect too much.. I used to watch this type of movies for decades. Witcher does not bring anything new .. Just for killing time.. Or if you are a fan of game.. Then it may be for you .. But nothing new here... Do not look at those 10 stars.. Seems like they may be intentionally made to keep rating high..
Like i said .. Do not expect too much..",5
The Witcher,"I will probably complete watching all the episodes sometime, as i do love this type of shows, but i have to admit, that i started browsing youtube for cat videos 5 minutes into the first episodes...",4
The Witcher,A wonderful story.... Wonderful season... You will ruin season if you keep comparing it with Got.. So don't compare its a different world of magic and monsters..,10
The Witcher,I see a fantastic 4 legacy... it could be fantastic but then something happens and it becomes meh,6
The Witcher,Gets better each episode just enjoy & rate so they make more programmes like these better than eastenders!,10
The Witcher,"There is no possible logic way of thinking, that could ever justify giving this a rating let's say below a 5. More production work went alone in the Blaviken fight scene of the first episode, than you will ever dream to experience.
This show is just awesome.
And you will see it rise with,or without your toxic attitudes towards everything.",10
The Witcher,"Amazing, just like GOT. I love it. The acting is amazing. Henry Cavill did a fantastic job",10
The Witcher,"I watched first episode of Netflix ""The Witcher"" first many audience now they comparing it series as better than ""Game of thrones "" I will tell you what happening hereFirst Episode was beyond the great like one hour of magic cinematography and scoring was outstanding fight scenes are unbelievable ... Directing from ""Alik sakharov"" the man behind eight episode of ""Game Of Thrones "" he did excellent job especially in fighting scenes how he use Camera corner he did a so much great and hard work here and acting till now I can't tell who is bad or good everything was good from start to finish.. Henry cavill as ""The witcher "" one thing this Man was born for this role
About why audience compare to game of thrones because the scars never healed.. Season 8 hurt us to much it's just a few months game of thrones ended and came this one that's why to much hate for (GOT) thats my opinion
So game of thrones is the greatest thing happened in TV History
And yes when u go to start to watch The Witcher there's so much elements they take from GOT especially fighting gory scenes and battle and unexpected killing question why? Because half the crew they worked in game of thrones for four first season all here in first episode of this series and director to
So my friends enjoy the show have a good start and beautiful fantasy imagery",8
The Witcher,"I feel this is new top show as far as fantasy is concerned. It is everything I have hoped for. It starts with great writing. The dialogue works. The exposition is done very intelligently and feels natural. You never feel a character explains something just for the viewer's sake. Geralt unsurprisingly doesn't talk much, but they have done a great job of juxtaposition him against character who talk at him a lot. The acting is amazing and all of the characters feel real and alive. The visuals are amazing. The show obviously relies heavily on CGI, but it blends in very well. I never looked at something and thought ""oh thats CG"". The production value is also amazing. I never had the impression that something was missing or shot a certain way because that's just the budget they had. The fight sequences work very well for me. I have done martial arts myself and I have seen a lot of fighting that just look like they do a lot of acrobatics and lazy moves that wouldn't work. Here, although I think they invented a kind of ""witcher fighting style"", it looks like it could work. It looks real. Nothing is hidden behind shaky cam or thousand cuts. The whole show just works on all levels. Soundtrack is awesome too.",10
The Witcher,"Okay, I never write reviews, but this series deserve all the hype, I love it already. I have personally never read the books, but I have played all the Witcher games and honestly I'm impressed. The first thought that crossed my mind when I heard Netflix was about to make this series was that they would butcher it, but the have done the opposite. Definitely worth a watch, it's just great, watch it!",10
The Witcher,"I don't think I would ever have thought a series adaptation of Witcher would have come out so seamless. Having read the books and played the games, I really think that the series has captured the essence of 'not all monsters are evil' and that most of the evil monsters are in fact human. In addition, the ensemble cast of three different simultaneous narratives work well chronologically, and the fight scene in the ""Butcher of Blavekin"" is not only insanely filmed and acted, but also pays more homage to books and lore by showing how Geralt got that name. All actors in this series fit perfectly, even though they don't completely resemble that of the books, such as Triss and Yennifer, I do believe they hold their own personalities well, and add a lot to the story.Following on, women in this series are shown to be strong and independent without the reliance of them being godlike, each power they possess has a downside, just like all others. This is a pleasurable change in series nowadays, and in fact it shows more cunningness and intelligence in characters such as yennifer must find other ways to control their powers and bypass their cons.",10
The Witcher,Reached Episode 3 and got too see Triss Marigold..Was sooo looing forward to seeing how they made her brilliant red hair..Just to find out that they crap on it and made her a brunette ..Almost made me stop watching it,7
The Witcher,Ahhh yeah love it! Feels a bit of everything in here. From GOT to Avatar to Dungeons & Dragons! Fantasy mind bend with a seriously cool main dude. Best effort so by Netflix. So gutted will be soooo long wait for next series!,8
The Witcher,"Plasctic armor (it's really just painted plastic), wich doesn't protect from any kind of blow, even easy one. Why they even wear it if it so useless
Infantry charging cavalry wich have highground. Not even in formation with spears, but skirmishing with swords and axes. So dumb. I understand that it's fantasy but it soooo bad. Put at least small portion of logic, please.Original world of Witcher had logic, your's recreation - not",1
The Witcher,"NON-LINEAR MOSAIC STORYTELLING
Now, Netflix has handled the entire structure of the first season remarkably well, and if you are TRULY familiar with the original source material by Sapkowski - that is - several stand-alone short stories, you have to admit that Netflix has weaved those stories together, thread by thread, into a complete mosaic. Understandably, people with no previous knowledge of the Witcher universe, may feel a bit lost, but in order to grasp what is going on, piece by piece, you just need to pay attention, follow the dialogue carefully and watch for clues and signs. I mean, this is part of the experience and it the show, in this regard, does not ask way too much - it is no Godard or Antonioni, for God's sake... for example - if one character has a partially grey beard and in a later episode, he is sporting a similar black beard, it is hard to figure out, timeline-wise, when is this or that episode happening Try to watch it, focus on the show, shut down your social media and put down your mobile phones, and you'll get it. All in all, Netflix clearly crafted the first season to let the viewers experience the world of the Witcher from different perspectives, introducing pivotal motifs of the saga, while incorporating key points from Sapkowski's short stories with the goodly portion of monster fights and magic.
ACTING
Very strong performances are delivered by Cavill (he IS Geralt), Anya Chalotra and Freya Allan. Besides the main trio of protagonists, there are can be found very good and convincing acting by others, most notably, the characters of Jaskier, Stregobor, Mousesack, Tissaia de Vries and Cahir are all excellent and memorable portrayals. To be honest, Jodhi May as Queen Calanthe is just phenomenal as she often steals it when she is 'on stage'.
FIGHTING
Geralt's fighting choreography is almost unbelievable and the way how the scenes are executed visually is breathtaking - from camera angles to cuts - everything looks extremely smooth and effective - a true dance of death. Conversely, Geralt's struggles with various monsters are depicted as more brutal, visceral and full of improvisation. In terms of fight/battle scenes without Cavill's Geralt, there is much left to be desired, but, again, not when compared with other shows' rather poor way of handling such action sequences. But, looking at Cavill's fencing choreography, one would like to see the same quality of choreography in case of other members of the cast.
BELIEVABLE, DOWN-TO-EARTH AESTHETICS
It must be mentioned that I also like the overall aesthetic direction of the show, since it rather tries to use normal-average locations in Poland, Hungary or the Canary Islands. A wise decision which makes the locations enough eclectic and distinct from one another, but it simultaneously oozes a certain degree of believability in its toned-down environments, so much so that it's easy to imagine that it is happening on the Continent.
YENNEFER BACKSTORY
Lauren Schmidt has enriched such a difficult material with additional, albeit no less important, pieces to complete the mosaic - a personal story of Yennefer, the most powerful sorceress of the Continent, who has always been 'THE ONE' for Geralt - a woman of his life, though in terms of Yennefer's ability to fulfil her most innate desires and wishes, she seems to be powerless. Lauren Schmidt, in my opinion, understood the importance to highlight this dichotomy in Yennefer's character within the Wither's Saga, and, the TV series succeeds remarkably in creating a concise storyline and development for Yennefer to manifest how steep price has to be paid by Yennefer, and such rendition of her backstory helps the viewers to better understand her personality and motivations.
GERALT and YENNEFER
Besides, the on-screen bond between Cavill's Geralt and Chalotra's Yennefer works incredibly well and their romantic/love scenes are a treat to watch. Unlike in the early seasons of the GOT, they seem to be believable and, whilst they incorporate some nudity here and there, it simply feels much more tasteful in both aesthetic and narrative sense.
MUSIC
I certainly like the style of the music, which tries to finds its own tone without (un)intentional use of very strong and iconic soundtracks of CD Projekt Red's Witcher games. In sum, it has the much-needed Slavic flavour and works as a background musical nuances emphasising particular mood of the scenes and it is equally successful in several tense action scenes. Plus, Jaskier, faithful to his profession of the bard, performs some memorable pieces from his repertoire - a nice touch by Netflix.
VISUALS
Unfortunately, the CGI is the weakest ingredient of the show, and as such, the strongest monster fights are the one with more profound use of the practical effects, masks and etc. Secondly, the design of the Nilfgaardian armour is horrible, it does not work, it looks cheap and it is painfully obvious - I sincerely hope for the change in the second season. Costumes, wigs and make-up, on the other hand, somehow manages to save the day, especially in case of Geralt's, Jaskier and Yennefer's outfits. It is a strange mix of quasi-Venetian, partially Elizabethan and to some extent Tudor mix of clothing with a pinch of what is to be perceived as 'medieval' , but this blend of styles culminates into something that looks rather refreshing and unique.
ADAPTATION
To begin with, I've read the short stories and the books by Sapkowski already in the 90s, and he is one of the fantasy writers I held in high regard, though I've also played all the major CD Projekt Red's games, and there have been one of my favourite RPGs. I also love GOT, but these two serious should be compared because they are about absolutely different things, which becomes even more tangible when you are familiar with the source materials - that is Sapkowski's original short stories (each around 60 pages) and Martin's the ASOIAF saga. First of all, it must be mentioned that the Witcher games focused considerably more on the politics than Sapkowski's books, not to mention the short stories that were originally conceived as stand-alone/serialised stories based on classic Slavic/Anglo-Saxon/Nordic folklore with narrative underpinning from several fairly-tales, albeit with a twist. Even the books are revolving around a trio of central protagonists of Geralt, Yennefer and Ciri with some important secondary or recurring ones, following essentially one underlying storyline about Ciri's role as a child of destiny. As oppose to the GOT or Martin's ASOIAF, the main focus of Sapkowski's works has never been on the shady political machinations, huge military conflicts and warring factions or dynasties. Yes, these things are happening in Sapkowski's works, but they rather embody the role of the background as oppose to the GOT, where these elements are, in fact, in the foreground with myriad of main characters compared to the Witcher saga.
VERDICT
I expected a good old classic fantasy full of exciting fights, plenty of unique manifestations of magic and occasional doses of wit and light-hearted humour - and - Netflix has delivered it.
THE UGLYSorry NETFLIX, but the aesthetics of Nilfgaardian armour is just..... unbearable. I mean, you should have used black/dark variations of classic Roman Lorica or, at least, something like Artorius' armour from Fuqua's version of King Arthur.",10
The Witcher,"Sold!! this series is a perfect example of how to follow source material the first episode has just the right blend of action and story it is only the first season so it does need to build the characters up mind you and not jump straight into high stakes as there would be no point to it, its just how the hugely successful games did it and I can not fault that in anyway. If you are new to the Witcher or already a fan this show is certainly worth a watch.
I will say I am a fan of the books and games and I feel like this show is a nice blend of the two and as a fan of the universe I am in no way outraged at how they handled this adaptation 10/10 all the way well done to all the guys involved in this show keep it up.",10
The Witcher,"Will be 10/10 for you if you liked GOT.
Will be 1/10 for you if you dislike generic hollywood production.This show had so much potential. But whoever produced this instead opted for cheap show designed to fill in the gaps after GOT ended for huge $$$. Nothing to do with witcher lore which is just exploited for prime example of cultural appropriation. In essence, mindless gory-fest with woke crap mixed in and strong empowered woman here and there.",1
The Witcher,"The production of The Witcher is pretty epic...it's obvious Netflix went all in on this, and it paid off as far as the cinematography is concerned.The acting...meh...honestly my issue was not with the acting. I am a huge fan of this series so I kind of had an idea of what to expect (or at least I thought I did) but for some reason a lot of the material that was turned into a script for this series ..it just didn't work for me. There were a lot of ""serious"" or ""intense"" moments that just came across so corny to me, but I can't figure out WHY....it just isn't connecting for me.I was expecting to love this series on a GOT level....instead, I am left feeling as puzzled as I was watching Westworld season 2 lol. Other people are seeming to enjoy it so far, so maybe it's just me...maybe I'll give the first few episodes a rewatch before continuing on... But as of right now, it just isn't drawing me in the way I expected it to.I still recommend it, mainly because the cinematography, again, is BREATHTAKING....plus I am hardly arrogant enough to think that a series is no good just because I personally didn't care for it. Here is hoping something changes for me and I start enjoying it as much as everyone else here!",5
The Witcher,"I'm lost for words which is a first. Remember when LOTR came to life in 2001 and we were all amazed with the visuals and the story telling and the acting? What a time to be alive, having the chance to see another masterpiece before the end of the decade. Omg I cannot stress enough how much I loved this, just binged the whole season in not even a day. I am so impressed and so excited for the next season. This is exactly what this generation needs, to see how we grew up with amazing shows like this - QUALITY OVER QUANTITY people!",10
The Witcher,"As a fan of the games and reader of Lady of the lake, I am really pleased where this is going. The trailers had me concerned Cavill wouldn't deliver but his love for the character shown through. He had some great moments in this episode and I'll definitely be binging the rest this weekend.",10
The Witcher,"This series is not really made for those without prior knowledge of the short stories or novels. Thankfully, however, it is better than the 2001 Polish movie and the 2002 TV series.The good: Henry Cavill was an excellent choice to play Geralt of Rivia. He embodies the titular Witcher not only in his physical appearance but also his demeanor - professional and uninterested in the political turmoil going on around him. The costume design is generally good and the overall production value is high, though of course not on par with Game of Thrones.The bad: The series starts out slow and does not really get going until about episode 4, which is midway through the first season. As mentioned above, unless you have some prior familiarity with the story either through the novels or video games, things can be really confusing at first. Moreover, the supporting cast is uneven - some are good, others are quite bad. Same for the dialogues.It remains to be seen if the showrunners can pull off a good TV series. Season one was short and a bit meandering. It is as if the writers didn't know where to begin the story and ended up trying to fit the events in the short stories and novels into just a few episodes, finally setting down on basing the series loosely on the first novel but then running out of time to really do justice to that story arc during the first season.My hope - and it seems this is the direction of the series, once the writers made up their minds - is that this version of The Witcher will focus on the story of Geralt, Yennefer, and Ciri as told in the main novels. In my opinion, this would make for most engrossing story of The Witcher, but it would require better development of some characters and even some changes from what we got in the first few episodes.",7
The Witcher,"Let me start by saying that I enjoyed the whole season, except the last episode which was pretty anticlimactic. This series has many positives but also some really bad negatives.I particularly liked acting by Henry Cavill (Geralt), Freya Allan (Ciri). I liked the setting, most of the storytelling (except of the rushed Yenefer's origin story).And now let's dive into the negatives. First of all, I really disliked some of the Afroamerican casting, especially for the role of Fringilla. I'm open to including people of all colors (we are all humans after all), but only when it works with the story. Witcher is known for displaying the racial fights, kind of advocating for equality, but disregarding the physical attributes of the characters in the source material is just dumb.
Secondly, I don't understand why they messed up the Nilfgaardian costumes that much. At one moment you can visibly see the modern balaclava in a close up! And don't get me even started on the stupid leather wrinkles! Moments like this make the show look ""cheap"" while others look just spectacular.Overall score is 7.5/10",7
The Witcher,"Writing, acting, filming, everything was perfect. I watched the whole season (8 episodes) in under 8 hours. Loved this show",10
The Witcher,I registered an account just for this review. Its actually a well-done title. I have never played the witcher game but I read the book. This is recommended,1
The Witcher,"I've only watched 2 episodes so far but I'm hooked. It's a tv show I find myself not even useing my phone at all during. Even to get on here to see if I know a person from something else. Why can't people just be happy that they made a show. I'm glad I see more good reviews than bad. Over people giving bad reviews cuz they didn't get their way or things don't go the way they want. Well then maybe you should be the writer and behind the camera then don't ya think? Bet it be horrible cuz you wouldn't know what your doing lmao ??. And then you'd be the one with the bad reviews. Just like things for what they are, cuz it's a gift that we even get things like sequels and or shows that didn't necessarily need to happen",9
The Witcher,"I mean I love Witcher, books were part of my childhood, Witcher3 is one of my favorite games. And I hate to say that messing up the characters just makes me feel annoyed too much, if you are new to the series- I guess it's ok, but not for me.",1
The Witcher,"Zero experience with the games and source material. Perhaps if I had, I wouldn't feel like I'm being jerked in different directions every ten minutes. Also, really 9.5? I know it's just been released but this show is definitely overratedNo character development. I can't ""root"" for a single character. Sets and costumes, special effects, and fight choreography are great. But if you don't give me someone to care about, I won't keep watching. Henry Cavill is watchable but his character has no decent backstory or connection to anyone or anything, and I'm halfway through it already. After anxiously awaiting this for so long, I feel cheated.",2
The Witcher,A boring and ridiculous series whose events are never connected. You will get lost and you follow it. They spent a lot of money on nothing.,1
The Witcher,More seasons please!!! #love it!Well done #Netflix,10
The Witcher,"As the title says amazinglytrue to the lore of the Witcher universe. I did have my concerns when I learned that ""Superman"" Cavill was going to play the Witcher, but I've seldom seen such love and devotion to a role and universe, so my corcerns was quickly kicked to the corner. Cavill is the embodiment of Gerald of Rivia in every single moment of every episode",9
The Witcher,"I've been waiting for this show since it was announced and the wait is over.
I don't have much to say about The Witcher all I can say is that it is simply magic. 10/10 Worth",10
The Witcher,"I have seen two episodes so far, and I am loving it. I hope they didn't rush it; and the storyline and characters weaves seamlessly into one another. Still watching... Its made already though.",10
The Witcher,This series had so much potential but the terrible on-the-nose dialogue and the boring uninspired cinematography really made this a unbearable to watch. Each scene drags on for way to long and the pacing of the episodes is ruined by unnecessary scenes.I really wanted this to be good because I love both the Withcer books and the games :(Do yourself a favor and pass on this.,2
The Witcher,Absolutely bloody magnificent. The finest sword choreography ever. Cant believe we gotta wait till 2021 for season 2. Henry Cavill IS Geralt of Rivia.,10
The Witcher,"Awesome show . Henry C is cast so perfectly cast as the lead character.
The production is high and direction is awesome !
Such an exciting show probably better than GoT .
This is the best show in tv now !
Long live the Witcher !***Update started to become boring and lost interest due to story failing to become more as episodes went on **** perhaps the source material is juvenile as well ?",6
The Witcher,"I watched 5 episodes till now and it's really good. I don't understand why people are comparing it with GoT. I think any sort of Fantasy shows will now be compared with GoT now we are in that zone. Nobody is appreciating The Witcher uniqueness all I've been seeing from morning is some random critic saying ""it's no GoT"" well I'm a huge fan of GoT but you can't dwell in the past and compare apples with oranges.This so called critics insulting Witcher is just pathetic if they don't like it they could tell it's not a good show without comapring with GoT. The Witcher is definitely worth a watch and you will like it if you watch it with open mind.",9
The Witcher,Flawless series so far. Let's hope it won't finish like Game of Thrones.,10
The Witcher,Its way better than got. Characters are more interesting and intriguing. Fith scenes with sword the best I have ever seen!,9
The Witcher,Cavill's Witcher 10/10 but Yennefer and Ciri really really ugly maybe they can be good actress but the not deserve role. The witcher madallion tragicomic. And finally 8 episode? 8 ? Are you kidding? I dont understand this season. Sorry but I will not wait 2 season this short tv series. Short short shooooooooort,7
The Witcher,"Writing weak, more Hokus than Pocus. May give up after third episode.",6
The Witcher,"Henry Cavill really loves this character and it absolutely shows. He gives it his all as Geralt and tries his best with the dialogue to make it his own The fighting scenes are outstanding, brutal and well choreographed. The cinematography is pretty great as well, nothing really stands out but the world they've created is beautiful at best.",8
The Witcher,"I have read a few of the books and played TW3 game, so I knew what I was getting into - I can't think of a better way the books and lore could have been played out, in film or TV.I watched the first season in one day, I just couldn't stop watching. I loved the story, the action, characters, the aesthetics..... just bravo from everyone involved!!!I have to hand it to Henry Cavill, who embodies Geralt so perfectly. In hindsight you can always say ""I couldn't imagine any one else in the role""....like Downey Jr as Iron Man for example. I'm not sure how true this is, we will never know.... but I certainly think Cavill IS Geralt, and I'm hoping this gets multiple seasons, as him and everyone else have tuly made something special that I will be eager to watch multiple times, and hope to see more of.The possibilities for this going forward are HUGE!",9
The Witcher,"The first episode was quite promising. After that the so called ""underrepresented"" races and genders take over in typical Netflix production style.The books are set in a mythical version of northern Europe in medieval times.
Netflix used the vast visions of the books and their locations/medieval European people types and thought ""F it! Lets just change it so the series is basically Geralt of Africa instead""This is further compounded by the fact that with every passing episode the series just gets worse and worse (more and more black out of places characters, more and more feminists including a tribe of mixed race feminist elves).Cinematography wise its good and some of the acting is good to great.
Film locations are confusing as hell. One minute it looks like hes in a barren, snow desert and the next minute it looks like hes on an arid island.Very disappointing and overly woke. Give it a miss",2
The Witcher,"Of course, don't pay any attention on the terrible overacting and the horrible directing...Why should you take a look on that things.
Armor look like a cheap plastic.
The script seems to have been written by a five-year-old girl, and money was given only for the salary of the main actor. The new fan film (Half a century of poetry later 2019 Alzur's Legacy) also has a weak script, but it was even more pleasant to watch than this tolerant nonsense.",1
The Witcher,"Show was okay as dumb entertainment, but i cant get over the whispering from Cavill. Most childish thing since batman. Who thought that was a good idea??",7
The Witcher,"I love how they interduce characters, ecpecially Yen ?.",10
The Witcher,"I watched 5 episodes and still there's no clear gaol to the story because it's collection of short stories, i got confused so many time watching this , maybe the novel fans love this , but not for me , it feels like 8 short cheap films put together,
of course as usual Netflix had to involve politics even in fantasy show.
as a guy who played the game i can say that this show definitely doesn't have the feel of the amazing world of the witcher . Like every Netflix adaptation , it feels like cheap copy",6
The Witcher,In whole honesty I can't imagine how some critic can rate this 0/100. Only way I can think of it is that Netflix hasn't paid enough for 'reviews'. This show deserves a chance :),9
The Witcher,"Oh my god what have they done. They have taken a great book series that was translated into a brilliant video game series and removed it from any shred of reality.
The fight scenes are great and it feels like they spent all of their money on choreography and realised that their was no money left for script-writing and cinematography. The camera angles and colour changes in post are tacky, the one-liners are uninspired and lackluster.
The entire story has been remixed into something different and something not entertaining. It looks like they have gone out of their way to make this bad.BUT if you have never heard of the witcher and never engaged with anything to do with the concept before, maybe you will enjoy it. When compared to what has come before for this series, it is terrible.I have a soft spot for Henry Cavill, and I struggle to understand the acting choices here. He acts like a first year drama student, one shot will have 0 emotion and the next will have 3 at the same time. I want to believe it was the result of confusing direction, the rest of the show seems to have confusing direction so why not.",3
The Witcher,"Just watch it, you wont be disappointed if you played the witcher games or read the books or even if u are new to the witcher world, this show is 10/10 from me.",5
The Witcher,"Well, this is very dissapointing. As a huge fan of book series I'm on episode 6 and bored as hell. How could such interesting and complex characters become so dull and flat? Emotions, humor, charisma, cheekiness are lost on generic pretty faces, and even that is a miss. Casting is a huge miss sadly, even Ciri and the Witcher. Everyone is gorgeous, but lifeless. Flasing and Henry's chest occasionaly doesn't save the case.
The storybuilding is a miss, the worldbuilding is miss, timeline is all over the place, nothing is interesting nor captivating. We are shown elves, monsters, mages, battles, Brokinon, dryads, everything is shoved in our faces, none of it makes any sense or has any meaning behind. The scenery is pretty, when it's not very obvious CGI. Such rich, detailed, complex world is again lifeless on the screen.
I'm so very very sad, the Witcher stories have so much soul and unique charm to them. Instead we get to see lots and lots and lots of Calante being cliche badass woman, Yennifer being cliche strong woman who's seen ""crap"" and Ciri running through woods and doing nothing. Yay, fun...",4
The Witcher,"As a huge witcher fan, I love how close the show has been to the books. They not only take the short stories in the book ""the last wish"" and bring them to life, they also introduce what actually is going on in the timeline for other characters. It flows very well and I honestly am very impressed as I wasnt expecting it to be as good as it is.",9
The Witcher,"The only one who is good in this series is Henry cavill, plays geralt very well. Everything else Looks just cheap, would Not advise anyone to watch this. The costumes don't look any good, first episode is very boring, I really don't understand why people give this show a 10. It's Not the same quality as GoT or Westworld",1
The Witcher,"Was a good watch overall but the first two episodes felt thin, rushed, and not well scripted. The last few episodes were much more filled out and better quality. But they may want to get someone else to write season 2, it could have been so much better especially the end. All the best parts of the books were right there to put to film yet the writers went and made every great moment in the books, mediocre at best on the screen.Overall the show has potential to be great, but they need to get rid of the writer with someone of higher quality. Someone who knows how to add depth to the characters, since all of them in this show were very thin at best.",8
The Witcher,I don't usually do review but this is one of the best thing happening in a long time.. I'm a huge fan of the book series and the game's and for my humble opinion this it perfect. Hopefully for the next season will have much more money for special effects 10/10.,10
The Witcher,It is a decent if you do not count racist cultural appropriation. Netflix had a chance to finally give just a little to Slavic people and they used it to promote cultural appropriation. Could have been better,8
The Witcher,"Worst cgi I have seen in years. At least on a good TV. The cast is a complete failure expect the witcher. I am a huge witcher game and book fan and this is just bad. Camera work, cutting, screenplay. Everything.",3
The Witcher,"I am an eternal fan of the Witcher, and I was waiting with anticipation to see the Netflix release. While I feel they skipped quite a few essential parts of the story (like the reason why Ciri needs to find Geralt and her connection to him), it is understandable. Overall the story is captivating, and I only hope they will do the books justice and finish it properly!",9
The Witcher,"Compared to a lot of fantasy series, this one was above average, but still felt like it missed the mark a bit.The whole timejumping back and forth didn't work for me and made the story less engaging. A lot of the plot felt like scenes had been cut here or there, which made the more exposition heavy sections (the bard even makes a 4th wall joke about this) feel clunky.I still watched the series in one day and I did enjoy most of it. Just for the love of all that is unholy hire a better CGI team for next seasons dragon!!!",7
The Witcher,"I'm very glad they decided to make this... It's a pretty good TV series... The acting, writing and direction are all very good... Excellent production values as well... Beautiful landscapes and an excellent music score to boost... It might seem a bit rushed at the start but it does start coming into its own around the 3rd episode and becomes pretty epic... Stick around and you shouldn't be disappointed...Initially, I was a bit disappointed with Henry Cavill's selection... I had the idea of a witcher in my head and it was someone more along the lines of Mads Mikkelsen... But keep watching and you'll see Henry Cavill does an excellent job and really does make the character his own...And don't be deceived by critics that compare this to Game of Thrones... That's like saying you don't like chicken because it doesn't taste like beef... Judge things on their own merits, rather than on your preconceived notions of what you would like them to be...Here's hoping there are many more seasons to come... :)",10
The Witcher,"Just saw 2 episodes and I was just amazed by every single detail. The story, the character build-up and the graphics that took my breath away. I haven't seen GoT but I am sure this is equivalent or even better than GoT.",10
The Witcher,Perfect Replacement of Game Of Thrones.Main Character Plays Each Role Perfectly.,10
The Witcher,Totally worth watching it. Your not gonna regret it at allll!!,10
The Witcher,"Worth investing the time to understand, and when you do the show really rewards your effort.The show has a complex timeline to it with different timelines all shown at once. But at least it's nowhere near as confusing as Westworld, and is equally as rewarding.The casting is brilliant, and Geralt's fight scenes incredible - especially as Henry Cavill did all his own stunts.",10
The Witcher,"What is wrong with Netflix? They launched with great shows, but are now just throwing money at pretentious and at times terrible shows. This series is just a pretentious mess.
The production value is high, but the writing, the pacing, the acting is just bad. Cavill is trying to make Geralt a macho dude, which Jason Statham is just better at. It even sounds like the lines you hear him say were dubbed in post-production, like they did with Bane in The Dark Knight.
The music comes in at weird times and just doesn't match what you see on screen.
The first 20 minutes are so convoluted with names and events in the past, that I had no idea what the hell they were talking about. Impossible to remember all of it.
Next up: a young girl, no introduction, not even a name, is beside some man and a woman knighting people, unexplained why or where they are or who they are.
And this keeps going on for the rest of the first episode: scenes and characters put together without exposition. So, after 1 episode I didn't care for any character.
Just rewatch the very first episode of Game of Thrones, and see how writers and directors should introduce a vast new world and characters.
Then the action scenes: not impressed at all because there is no tension. There is no sense of danger. I guess the director thought: if it looks good, it is good. That is not how an action scene makes people care. It's the tension and possible danger that makes action scenes impressive to watch.
The nudity: it's there, but doesn't need to be there. If you watch it, you'll know what I mean. It's like the director thought: this will make it look mature. It does the opposite. It makes it look desperate.
I haven't read the books, and a show should not require me to have read the books to be interested. I played the games, and they are amazing compared to this pretentious mess. If a game can tell the story better than a show with actors, writers, directors, ... then you know they messed up.
Knowing this show is already confirmed to have a second season, shows that Netflix management doesn't give a crap anymore about quality.",4
The Witcher,"Terrible acting, terrible cgi, terrible plot, it's rubbish. It's as good as zena warrior princess. Should be a bbc show, clearly low budget with a few murders. Mentioning GOT alongside this should be outlawed. On a different level. Would be like Mike Tyson v Barry Mcquigan. AVOID.",1
The Witcher,"I watched the first episode, didn't understand a damn thing of what was going on. Maybe this is for people that played the game or read the books. It makes me sick hearing folks compare this to Game of Thrones. Game of thrones first episode was a lot clearer for people who havent read the books, and it was quite easy to understand who is who and what was going on. Here there are just cheap battles, poor writing and silly acting. And now Superman talks like Batman. GG Netflix. You proved to me once again how incapable you are of hiring good screenplay writers and solely rely on CGI and marketing. If the majority of people think this is 10 stars, then yes, the world is going down......",1
The Witcher,"Watched half of the first episode after all the hype today and high imdb rating. But the characters are shallow, there is no believability in their interactions and no tension created. On top of which the lead character seems to have been plucked out of some soft metal band (e.g. Europe). Comparisons with GoT are way off the mark - maybe some of the settings and scenery but that's about it. Overall not worth watching, there's plenty of better stuff out there atm (mrs maisel, watchmen, unbelievable, succession etc).",4
The Witcher,Fun af. Good humor. Good swordplay. And lots of other good things.,10
The Witcher,"I did not read books nor play the games. Just wanted to get some entertainment, and...
After two episodes, I have still no idea what are the main goals of the main characters. I am not sorry for anyone who dies, I am not worried about those who are still alive. Simply I do not care. The show produced no emotions so far.
Storyline looks as if it has been chopped by crazy editor, scenes that should bring emotions are often boring.
Yet, there is something in the show that makes you want to see what happens next.",3
The Witcher,"I only had time to watch the first two episodes. I was looking forward to this serie a lot. Sure thing it's not perfect to every one, it's just impossible. But for me its amazing. I really enjoyed the dialogues, the humor, the fighting scenes, the mood in the scenes with geralt are pur gold. alone in the woods or with the peoples, he is always the witcher, a mutant with a lot humanity. I understand that some peoples are not feeling my 10/10 review.. but stop this 1/10 reviews because its not a 1*, this is not fair to the cast and netflix, who did again a great job.. The Witcher is not GOT and not lord of the rings or what ever. It is its own fantasy world. A world of great, dark and interessting and hopefully a lot more adventures to come during the next years. Netflix take my money, you deserve it!",1
The Witcher,"Henry Cavill showed us that he can be the ""Geralt Of Rivia"". He embrace the role. And the fight scenes was very good. The story telling was perfect. I loved everyting about this show.I recommend to everyone.",9
The Witcher,I genuinely had high hopes for this show but the writing looks like it's made for a teenage audience. The costume design is below average for such an expensive production. It's disappointing since I have been a fan for a long time. What does need to be said is Henry Cavill was the only excellent character. The others are alright but the bard needs to be killed off. Jaskier made the show unwatchable.,2
The Witcher,The Witcher series has a huge following and for good reason. Not only does it present some exciting fantasy action but spins normal fantasy tropes in slightly different directions.Geralt the character is one who doesn't want to get involved just get paid! But along the way he sees some of the ugly sides of humanity in conjunction with the ugly physical side of monsters.This aspect translates very well in Netflix's The Witcher series. The key here is this show runner and staff really know the books. Cavill appears to have a bachelors degree in Witcher novels because he IS Geralt of Rivia. They show doesn't pull punches. It doesn't cheese down the action. It presents it brutally so that the audience gets that same feeling - man monsters are ugly and damn people are uglier.It's dark. It's awesome. It's binge-worthy.,9
The Witcher,"I don't understand why whoever is in charge of decision making saw fit to change stuff that don't need changing and fix stuff that's not broken.The witcher is not an obscure series, thanks in part to the games, you can't just steal its name and put whatever you want in it. PEOPLE WILL KNOW! And they will be pissed.I've said it before and I'll say it again, Yennifer and Tris was poorly cast. Her voice is too screechy and ultimately made the character seems too annoying. I always imagine her played by someone like Eva Green, someone with an attractive and eloquent voice and commanding presence. Tris in this series just have zero screen presence.I don't know if they can recover from this. Dead characters are dead and bad changes are set. It may take a miracle for this series going forward to be good again.",6
The Witcher,I genuinely had high hopes for this show but the writing looks like it's made for a teenage audience. The costume design is below average for such an expensive production. It's disappointing since I have been a fan for a long time. What does need to be said is Henry Cavill was the only excellent character. The others are alright but the bard needs to be killed off. Jaskier made the show unwatchable.Disappointing to see that the show makes the Istredd and Yennefer relationship more believable than Yen and Geralt.,2
The Witcher,"I want to state I already done my review but after watching very closesly whole season I must say this series very good but dont deserve rating 9. Main problem of series is not plot, not fighting scenes neither are the armors of Nilfgaard which brought a lot of controversy all of those are great except maybe the armors :). Story is wonderfuly told, monster are amazing and fighiting scenes of Geralt are amazing. I would like to say some actors should receive great pay rise like Adam Levy(Mousesack), Joey Batey ( Jaskier ) he is really great as Jaskier, MyAnna Buring playing as Tissaia teacher of Yennefer and finaly the Gaia Mondadori as Pavetta all of them are really good in their acting and portraying their characters. The main problem of series is really poor leading cast- Henry Cavill might be muscle guys with talent yet he as Geralt is rather dull and worries about him were rather correct(those hairs ), the same goes with Yennefer the spite actress is beautiful she dosent suits the role the same Ciri. Paradox of the series is that Adam Levy probably would be far greater Geralt than Cavill, the same goes with Yennefer actress MyAnna Buring is so majestic in her roles as charming sorcerers mistress than probably everyone would prefer her as Yennefer! The same is with Ciri they took wrong actress to play Ciri I would greatly believe the Gaia Mondadori would be greater Ciri. Never before watching anything I felt that so many secondary role actors would be far better in main roles and that is just pity because while watching this series I get serious feeling to many leading actors received their roles through connections not proper interviews!. One last thing that truly disturbed me the most were some stupidity concerning Political Correctnes. I understand that nowadays their can't be movie tv show or simple spectacl without afro-americans or other race groups which is really sad but I understand Black Mages (which really suits their roles),messengers or even Dryads which cant be funny but creating black elf or afro-american Knight (barbarians/warriors ok) but knights?this is seriously disgraceful to any kind of history.",8
The Witcher,"I just watched 3 episode of this series so far and all the 3 episodes are outstanding. They have created a masterpiece. The sword fighting are breathtaking. As a GOT lover I don't want to compare with. Both the series have their own different story. Don't bring GOT into here. GOT and The Witcher both are masterpiece.
Happy watching.",10
The Witcher,"A great start to something that, if continued thoughtfully with as much respect as they put in to the first season, could go down as the next great fantasy series. I can only give my opinion, but as a fan of both the game series and the novels I believe Henry Cavill was perfectly cast as Geralt. He plays him with the kind of respect similar to that of Ryan Reynolds to Deadpool. From the way he speaks to his dry humor, you can tell he is drawing from the characteristics from both already established mediums showing thar he genuinely cares for the series as a whole and eminates that in to his performance. However if it stopped just at him that wouldn't guarantee a good series. The entire cast in this season does well in there parts. The effects well done, the dialogue is fantastic, and the fight choreography is probably the best I've seen in a television series in a long time. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a perfect series. There are times that the eye contacts in certain characters are more obvious and the Nilfgaardian armor still doesn't look the greatest, but the good honestly outweighs the bad. I simce its not an option I'd say my reading would be a 4.8/5. There's always room for improvement and I can't wait for season 2. Keep up the good work!",9
The Witcher,"I have watched all episodes and WOW did the time fly! The Good: Character development, sound effects, Geralt saying 'Fk!', the bard kicks, some decent animated monsters, excellent magic/sword scenes, and an awesome setting. The Bad: Not all characters are believable and the majority of the nude scenes should have been done with more finesse. The ugly: Some costumes are just ridiculously good looking, to the point it is almost comical. Conclusion: I had a great time watching season 1 and give it a 8.5/10.",8
The Witcher,"I just finished the first episode and it's a real mess. Trying to be 'cool' and riding on the Game of Thrones vibe, but its a complete and utter mess. What is the battle about? What is the 'love' scene? One cool fight scene in the end isnt gonna save this disaster...
Just watched ep2 and I changed my rating from 3 to 1 stars. It's amateur storytelling that doesnt go anywhere and a production budget is not going to fix that.
Something happens and it gets explained in the most amateur way.
The beauty of Game of Thrones was that you would instantly be sucked in the story and knew what was happening.
I still dont know what's going on in this mess.",1
The Witcher,"Some very good actors in this series.
I find it ""trying too hard"" & wanting to be more like GOT...
The first episode left me thinking what a waste of talent....poor script & comes across rushed.
I don't think I'll be wasting my time on episode two...",7
The Witcher,"First thing's first. For the love of God, stop comparing this with GOT. this is The Witcher, and by far the best live action movie/TV adaptation of Andrez Spaowski Novels.
Sure it has swords, axes, battles, monsters, nudity, blood, but this is NOT game of Thrones.
If you are a newbie to The Witcher world, but likes dark fantasy Movies/TV, you definitely won't be disappointed. This Netflix show has enough to keep you hooked up from 1st to Last episode & will leave you satisfied for your time and money.
If you are a witcher fan, then you are in luck. This is exactly what The Witcher fans always demanded and Netflix has delivered. Sure it can't best the games or even the books, but nothing comes close to this live action adaptation of The Witcher.
Henry Cavill shines and he is THE perfect Geralt of Rivia. The supporting cast has done a good job too especially Yennifer and Ciri. The story is intriguing, setting and the environment are just too good and perfect for a dark fantasy story telling.
ALL in ALL, a must watch this holiday. Please do not go for all the negative reviews out there for this show. Watch it your self and have your very own opinion. You won't be disappointed",9
The Witcher,"So far so good, i think this series will be one of the best soon!",10
The Witcher,"Not sure why everyone got on board with this show and thought it would be 'the next Game of Thrones' or similar. It is no better than most most video game adaptations, such as 'Tomb Raider,' which play out to be B-movie quality action flicks at best. While an acclaimed video game, all the flaws in the video game 'story' and world-building are sticks in the mud and obvious issues here when in TV show form. I never could get into the story in the game (i thought it was a weak point) whether it was the monotonous gobbly dialogue typical of high fantasy RPGs or the card-board cut out characters. Yet if you ask anyone the overall internet opinion on the Witcher is that is perfect in every way, and you will be attacked for criticizing it. Well, even if the game was 'perfect', that's not the case with this show.While I haven't read the books, all the issues from the game transfer to the show in its world building and story, which dissuade me from reading them. I don't know whether the fault is with the adaptation or original material, but the story simply fails to captivate and provide a meaningful overarching story. Neither are the characters interesting(the idea that the main character doesn't show any human emotion is a good idea for a video game, but not a book OR show.)Between the cheesy opening scene, which made me think of a low-budget show on the Sci-Fi Channel, to the cheesy, video game-esque dialogue, to the main character who is unrelatable and uninteresting, and most of all, the story and background which is hard to make sense of and therefore is boring, all the issues I saw with the Witcher from the game rear its head in this show. I thought perhaps it would be better because its supposed to be based on the books, but either they didn't do it justice or the original story is is a big high fantasy convulated nerd fest that doesn't transfer to a show form well. The reason LOTR and other fantasy works so well is that there is a captivating main story and main characters who you care about. The Witcher simply comes off as a generic, low budget fantasy show that begs you to care about whats happening but you simply don't.",4
The Witcher,"Don't listen to anyone just see it sword scenes are brilliantly directed sound mixing is like witcher 3 ciri's background story is really emotional. And henry's geralt voice is also great.About the common hate/criticism it's getting ""It looks like cheaper version of GOT"" give them a break alright they just started the show let them earn some money from it i'm sure netflix will improve the vfx quality in next season",10
The Witcher,"Great cinematography, engaging characters and true to the book. Each episode brings something different and builds a fascinating story which captures the imagination and maintains interest. Will rewatch the whole series again and already looking forward to season 2.",10
The Witcher,"I'm speechless.
I just can't describe how much i liked it",10
The Witcher,"So I just played some bits of the Witcher 3First Henry Cavill did a great and excellent Job !The story was complex, in a good way until around mid season when you start to understand what is going on and figure out the timelinesI enjoy TV series with complex timelines and different characters each doing their own thing leading to the same finale",9
The Witcher,"As a fan of the game, I found it cool to be able to identify certain characters from the game.Compared with the game it game me some more details on for instance how dark Yennifer is, why Geralt and Ciri is linked to eachother ""the witcher 3"" doesnt really eplain this.Im amazed with all the naysayers but there are always idiots out there trying to give good tv-shows a bad rep.I do admit Im a bit subjective since Im a fan of the game, but for me the first season was action packed had love, had drama had it all.
Ive never read the books but I know the timespan and you can not make a movie without watering some elements down.
Acting was definetly at same level as GOT if not better, and as a person who loves ACTION I say in that category its way better than GOT, but it doesnt have the same level of drama and lovestories and GOT so if thats your lane it wont be as good, but actionwise definetly better than GOT nunbers to back tihis up in the ACTION category this series 10, GOT 7.",10
The Witcher,"I read all of the books, and played all of the games.
As a devoted fan (for more that 4 years), I can't deny, that this series is, some what, exhilarating.
I don't agree with some of the choices, regarding the cast, but also, I can't deny the truthfulness of the storyline.
Most of my favourite stories were realized, and my imagination was challenged. I give it an 9 only because, of some bad acting, apart from that, I loved It.
P.S. Hanry Cavill is great in this (way better than superman)",9
The Witcher,"Now in no way is this show as bad as people thought it would nor is it as good as some of the other reviewers here think it is either.
First of, Henry Cavill as Geralt is the best part of this show 100%. No doubt about that. The show is worth watching just for his portrayal. He really cares about the character and it shows.
Pros:
-Henry Cavill as Geralt. Can't say this enough.
-The fight Choreography is just insane. GOT could have really used some of the insane fight sequences from the witcher series.
-The Really amazing moments between Jaskier(Dandelion) and Geralt. They did Jaskier perfectly in my opinion.
-Roach
Cons:
-Really bad casting choices like Triss,Foltest and the Driads. Also they butchered an entire portion from the books which was one of my favorite parts from the Last Wish actually.
-Nilfgaard Armour. Like who in the right mind actually thought that it looked even remotely good. I wanted to skip the parts where they came up in the screens.
-Very unfriendly to people not familiar with the books or games. This is a fan-service. Not entirely a con but you get the point.
-DESTINY THIS DESTINY THAT. GOD STFU. I know destiny is a main focal point in the books but it was over done even there. I just got so tired of that word after watching for a while.All in all its worth the watch if you're a fan of the Witcher games/books. I can't praise Henry enough for his performance though. Seriously.",8
The Witcher,"8 episodes made it feel like the story was going too fast and that some thing's that happened in season 1 should've happened later on in the series. But i haven't read the books or played the games so i wouldn't know.The names of places and people and creatures will take some getting used to. (like any other fantasy) Honestly at one point, with the episode of the 'Striga', i was 30 minutes in before i realised i had no idea what was happening and who was who so i quickly pulled up 'the witcher' wiki and restarted the episode.The timeline was also confusing. It was only episode 4 when i realised the characters weren't appearing chronologically. In the end it all came together nicely and i thought it was a decent method of story telling. (although dates wouldn't have hurt).Apart from those three things it was a really great watch. I loved the characters and the actors portrayals or those characters and the story is just so interesting. can't wait for season.@The Mandalorian, this is how a tv show about a brooding loner/anti hero is made.",9
The Witcher,"It's better. As someone who is familiar with the books and short stories, I'm impressed by how faithful they remained. I am only on the second episode but thus far it's very close.What really surprised me was how refining the storyline for the screen made it better. And that's only do the talent behind the project. They had to choose which elements to highlight and which elements to let fall behind. Is it excellent television I don't think so but it's good television and well worth watching. Is it Game of Thrones no it's it's own thing and the comparisons are only negative but that is Netflix's fault for encouraging it.",9
The Witcher,"I Don't have enough words to portray this 'Best of 2019' Tv Series..Every thing is perfect story,choreograph,cinematography,BGM everything is More then Perfect.",10
The Witcher,"Remember how in the book Calanthe tricked Duny into revealing himself by ordering to bring the clock forward? Well, in this TV series one of the guards just kicks Urcheon's helmet off his head. And that is the metaphor for the whole series. The plot is cheesy, trite, dull and completely deprived of imagination. It was good in the books, characters were deep and vivid. Why did you have to go and spoil it all? Thanks for ruining my favorite characters, Netflix.",1
The Witcher,"It feels like most Netflix original shows follow the same exact formula, bad CGI, mediocre acting and with a decent plot.As a fan of The Witcher books and games this was exactly what I expected.",5
The Witcher,Regardless of the books and games...40 minutes was all i could take.dialogue/acting/direction/silly out of touch music...this is at best dongeons & dragons level stuff with the meanings of today.Pathetic...utterly painfull and pathetic.,1
